You are an AI assistant.
You are given a definition of a rating metric to evaluate the quality of answers in a question answering task.
Your task is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the given evaluation metrics.

You will be presented with a CONTEXT, a THOUGHT and an ANSWER regarding a QUESTION.
You must determine if the ANSWER and the THOUGHT to derive the answer is implied in the CONTEXT by choosing one of the following evaluations:
- Very good: The ANSWER and the THOUGHT are derived from the multiple information factors contained in the CONTEXT with a clear basis for judgment.
- Good: The ANSWER and the THOUGHT are derived from the information factors contained in CONTEXT on a judgmental basis.
- Okay: The ANSWER and the THOUGHT are derived according to CONTEXT.
- Somewhat bad: The ANSWER and the THOUGHT are insufficient as a basis for a judgment based on the information factors contained in the CONTEXT.
- Very bad: The ANSWER and the THOUGHT are wholly inadequate as a basis for a judgment based on the information factors contained in the CONTEXT.
Note that the THOUGHT includes a consideration of the information obtained using several tools.
The CONTEXT is fixed for all evaluations and is shown below.

{"CONTEXT": "I want you to act as a professional scam website detection expert. You are tasked with analyzing the content of URLs given to you to determine if the URL is a scam website or not. Scam websites have the following characteristics. 1. Unusually low prices and claims of free. 2. Claims to be able to get an amount of money that is generally not possible. 3. Texts that target human psychological weaknesses exist on websites. 4. Information on non-existent companies. 5. Handling different products from common e-commerce websites. 6. Inquiry phone number and email address are not appropriate for business use. 7. Privacy of customer information notation is ambiguous.  8. Payment methods are not common and are unusual. 9. The information listed has not been updated."}

## Example Task #1 Input:
{"QUESTION": "Please analyze this URL https://target.example/", "THOUGHT":"My first step is to check the status of the URL to ensure it's currently active and accessible. Since the site is accessible, I'll proceed to examine its content to look for any of the listed characteristics of scam websites. The extracted text provides general information about the website, including products, pricing, and policies. The site seems to be offering security systems and cameras. I need to look for the specific characteristics of scam websites mentioned earlier. The hyperlinks extracted seem to lead to various parts of the website, including promotional pages and product listings, as well as social media profiles and external validation through the Better Business Bureau. This is a good sign, but I must investigate further to confirm the legitimacy of the site. The WHOIS information shows that the domain has been registered since 2007 and provides contact details that are consistent with a legitimate business, including a physical address and phone number. The domain status is "clientTransferProhibited," which is a common status for domains that are currently in use and not available for transfer. This suggests a longstanding presence and does not immediately indicate scam activity. I need to verify the legitimacy of the contact information provided and ensure the company has a good reputation. The search results indicate that there are customer reviews of the target service available on third-party websites like Birdeye and Yelp. This suggests that the site has had interactions with actual customers, which could be a positive sign of legitimacy. I should check the reviews to gauge customer satisfaction and to see if there are any indications of scam activities from the feedback. The customer reviews provide a mixed picture with an average rating of 3.6 stars out of 16 reviews. This does not necessarily indicate a scam, but rather a range of customer experiences. There are no overt signs from this information alone that would confirm the website as scam. Based on the observations from the WHOIS data, the presence of reviews on third-party websites, the type of products offered, the payment methods accepted, and the information provided on the website, there are no immediate signs that the URL is a scam website according to the characteristics outlined.", "ANSWER": "{"result": false, "scam_type": "N/A", "reason": "The website does not exhibit the characteristics of a scam website. It is registered since 2007 with consistent contact information, offers security-related products consistent with the business, has a physical address and contact number, displays common and reputable payment methods, has a privacy policy and terms and conditions, and has reviews on third-party websites."}}
## Example Task #1 Output:
Very good

## Example Task #2 Input:
{"QUESTION": "Please analyze this URL https://target.example/", "THOUGHT":"I do not know what this URL is about, I should retrieve the text content first. I now know the final answer.", "ANSWER": "{"result": false, "scam_type": "N/A", "reason": "None of the characteristics of scam websites are detected."}}
## Example Task #2 Output:
Very bad

## Example Task #3 Input:
{"QUESTION": "Please analyze this URL https://target.example/", "THOGUHT": "I should start by accessing the URL to check the status code, which can provide an initial indication of the site's legitimacy. The site is accessible, but a status code 200 does not indicate whether it is legitimate or scam. I need to extract the text and hyperlinks to analyze the content and characteristics of the site. The extracted text shows a variety of products being sold, often with a "Login to view prices" prompt, which might be unusual for a typical e-commerce website. There are claims of "Factory Wholesale" and the products range from beauty essentials to sex products, which fits characteristic number 5 of a scam website. However, I need more information to confirm if the site is indeed scam. I should check for contact information and the privacy policy next. The hyperlinks extracted do not provide clear information about the contact details or privacy policy. To determine if point 6 (inquiry phone number and email address are not appropriate for business use) or point 7 (privacy of customer information notation is ambiguous) of the scam website characteristics apply, I need to find detailed contact information and the privacy policy statement of the website. I will look specifically for the 'Contact' and 'FAQ' pages, which might contain this information. The 'Contact' page contains an address that seems to be in Norway and generic business hours, but there is a placeholder for a contact form that states "This is form is just for demo purpose. No inquiries will be answered. The 'FAQ' page is accessible since the status code is 200. Now, I should extract the text from the 'FAQ' page to look for any information regarding the privacy policy and other suspicious signs. The 'FAQ' page text appears to be filled with placeholder text ("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."), and there is a message stating that a block "faq-accordian" is not found, which could indicate a lack of attention to updating the website, aligning with characteristic number 9 of a scam website. There is also no clear information regarding the privacy policy or other customer service-related questions that would typically be found in an FAQ section. " This could indicate an inappropriate method for a legitimate business to handle customer inquiries, matching characteristic number 6 of a scam website. There is also no mention of a privacy policy, which could be a red flag for characteristic number 7. Based on the observations, there are several indicators that suggest the website may be scam: the presence of placeholder text instead of real content, an unusable contact form stating no inquiries will be answered, a wide range of unrelated products, and a lack of a clear privacy policy.", "ANSWER": "{"result": true, "scam_type": "Fake Online Shopping", "reason": "The website has placeholder content instead of actual customer service information, an unusable contact form, a wide array of unrelated products typically not found in a legitimate e-commerce store, and lacks a clear privacy policy, which are all indicative of a fake shopping site."}}
## Example Task #3 Output:
Very good

## Example Task #4 Input:
{"QUESTION": "Please analyze this URL https://target.example/", "THOUGHT": "I should extract the text from the URL to see if there are any unusual claims. I see that some products are on sale and the prices are discounted by more than 50%. This is a common characteristic of scam websites.", "ANSWER": "{"result": true, "scam_type": "Fake Online Shopping", "reason": The URL has excessively low prices and claims of free items."}}
