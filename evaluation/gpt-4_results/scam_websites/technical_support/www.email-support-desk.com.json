The use of email is wide spread from personal to professional uses. Email got its name from electronic mail. It is message or mail transferred digitally. Earlier, fax was also known as electronic mail as it is also transferred from one place to another digitally. Because of the confusion, it is very hard to know when exactly email was introduced. But it is believed that the use of email started in the 60s. In the beginning, emails were simple plain text that evolved with the passage of time. In the beginning, there was no online storage available for the email messages and both, sender and receiver had to be online at the time of sending of email. These days there are numbers of email service providers available that are offering different online storage spaces. You can get an online storage from 1 GB to hundreds of GBs. There are many third part email clients available in the market that are being used in different organizations. If you want to store the emails on your computers for offline uses, you have to configure the third party clients on the computers.

See the phones condition in the below images:\\n\\n[https://imgur.com/skrIRZX](https://imgur.com/skrIRZX)\\n\\n[https://imgur.com/rdRfIuw](https://imgur.com/rdRfIuw)\\n\\nI reached out to Google to file a warranty claim, and their response was as follows:\\n\\n*\"Thank you for contacting Google Support.*\\n\\n*We’ve carefully reviewed your case and have determined that this device is not eligible for a warranty replacement.

Based on the written warranty agreement, can you please explain why my device is not eligible for warranty services? Any answer that does not directly reference the written warranty agreement found below will not suffice:*\\n\\n[*https://support.google.com/store/answer/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer*](https://support.google.com/store/answer/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer) *\"*\\n\\nLink to screenshot of my response:[https://imgur.com/Knr4oRX](https://imgur.com/Knr4oRX)\\n\\nTheir response back:\\n\\n*\"Hi Tyler,*\\n\\n*Thanks for contacting Google support.*\\n\\n*My name is Chris and I\\'m the Floor Supervisor here, I have reviewed your case and understood that this device is noteligible for a warranty replacement.

The manager said he would get back to me, and he did so with this email:\\n\\n*\"Hi Tyler,*\\xa0\\n\\n*Thank you for your patience.*\\xa0\\n\\n*I understand your concern. As promised we have checked with our specialist team. As per the update, the device is not eligible for a warranty and there is nothing we can do about it.*\\xa0\\n\\n*I would request you to get in touch with our authorized repair partners UbreakiFix/Asurion and Google Mail-in.

I have a $500 paper weight sitting on my desk.\\n\\n**Updates:**\\n\\nI wanted to provide a couple of updates based on some of the comments.\\n\\n* The phone was not purchased by Google, but through mint mobile.  Mint is pawning the issue to Google, as they state that their warranty is straight from the manufacture.  Their RMA page did not work, and this is the response I got from them when reaching out to the support:[https://imgur.com/lCnqZJT](https://imgur.com/lCnqZJT)\\n* Regardless, Google should honor the warranty when bought through a third party reseller, as stated clearly on their website:[https://support.google.com/store/answer/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer](https://support.google.com/store/answer/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer)[https://imgur.com/1JZKlrL](https://imgur.com/1JZKlrL)\\n* Some have suggested that I go into a uBreakFix and have them deal with it.  I tried that already, they sent me away saying I need a warranty claim number from Google for them to work on it.\\n* No the phone was NOT damaged\\n* Even if the warranty was not valid for some reason, Google should at least give an explanation for why, not jus this BS answer of \"its not eligible, because its not eligible\"\\n* Because no modern day human can go without a cellphone, I had to go buy a new phone in the meantime.  I went with a OnePlus and have been very pleased with it, for far less money than the Google Pixel.  So at this point a replacement would be nothing but a waste of my life, as I would have to sell it to get my money back.  The hours of my life that are lost are a separate issue, which also has me bitter over this entire experience.\\n* To those accusing me of lying about talking to Google on the phone, there IS an option for them to call you when chatting with support.  Check your facts before making accusations:[https://imgur.com/Q2jvTh2](https://imgur.com/Q2jvTh2)\\n\\n**Final Update 12/14/2022:**\\n\\nThanks to the help of u/dmziggy I finally got a replacement from Google.  However I am still stuck because I had to buy a new phone in the meantime, so its still a loss for me.  I am going to sell the phone, but I won\\'t get back what I paid.  Because of this, I will be leaving this post up as a mar on Google\\'s reputation which is well deserved.

It has been exactly 3 months now trying to get my money back. What is the problem here? I am losing my patience, how would you like it if a company locked your account and wouldn’t give you your $100,000 back? Why did you accept the wire transfer only to close my account a minute later and make me fight for my money? If within the minutes of you accepting the wire transfer and locking the account, that means you knew that you shouldn’t have accepted it. You guys are playing with me. It doesn’t take a month to review 5 pages of info and send a wire transfer. Do I need to buy a plane ticket and pay you a visit? Email doesn’t seem to be working too well. I have a cousin in California who is a judge as well and will take legal action. I didn’t want to play this card but I have no choice left, if this goes for another week. I want my money back. And where is the harm in sending back money exactly where it came from? I really don’t see why you have dragged this on for so long. Am I being targeted being over 80 years old? Are you waiting for me to die to keep the money?\\xa0  \\n>  \\n>Don’t give me a one sentence response. I want full detail of the matter and an estimation of when that money will be back in the Ryan Electric bank account. For all I know, I am getting bullshitted by you guys, and you may not even be doing anything to fix this. Just keep dragging it on for another year, maybe I’ll be dead by then.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWell well well, you send them a nasty letter and they are right on top of it.\\n\\n> Hi-  \\n  \\n>  \\n>I\\'m really sorry about the delay here, somehow this ticket was pushed back in our queue. We are definitely handling this and I reminded the team as well. They did ask for one more thing, can you get a note from your bank stating that the R\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Electric corporate account was closed? We will need that to proceed. I will be handling this going forward, don\\'t hesitate in asking questions and I\\'ll make sure I answer them in a timely manner.

I need to get my money off the exchange, and I have been trying wire withdrawals at different times, and none of them worked. I never got the confirmation email, on 5 or more tries. I tried different banks, and accounts, nothing. I never heard back about it either. I never done online banking, but I saw ACH on the withdrawals page, and since wire isn\\'t working, I decided to bite the bullet and enable my online banking with Washington Trust.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>My account has been limited from trading for over a month now, and only had it enabled to withdraw, which never worked with the wire method.

In the meantime I went ahead and got online banking setup anyway. The very next day my account is locked.

A lot of actions over the past 5 months have seemed like a scam.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>What happened to Biggs taking this ticket personally until I got settled?

Original post but u/llizardqueen in r/MaliciousCompliance This is my first BORU post, though I\\'m a long time lurker. LMK if I messed anything up. \\n\\n\\n\\n[Want to demand employees come in early without pay and stay strapped to their desks until the clock strikes time off? You got it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/tkqu2c/want_to_demand_employees_come_in_early_without/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) 4 months ago \\n\\nI work in a demanding industry. As a result, barely anyone in my department takes their unpaid 1-hour lunch break in full or at all, including myself. Most everyone just eats at their desk while working, including me. A lot of people work unpaid overtime as well, including me (for me, it was about 1-2 hours this week on my day off unpaid overtime to get on top of the work). The manager/boss know this happens - they see it occur on a daily basis, but don\\'t contest it because, you know, free labour. \\n\\nRecently, the boss sent around an office wide email \"for a select few\" that stated, \"work hours are work hours\". The email said they expect everyone to be at work 10-15 (unpaid) minutes early to \"get a coffee\" and start work on the dot. They also said that the end of your work shift is when you stop working and that you can\\'t pack up anything prior ie. If you have a cup on your desk, you have to wait until your work ends on the dot to put it in the dishwasher. Doing this 2 minute task prior to the end of your shift is not acceptable. There was more to the email, but it\\'s not relevant to this post. \\n\\nI\\'m certain this email is partially directed at me, because I arrive to work only a few minutes early, grab a cup of tea (takes 1 minute - they have instant hot water) and then start working. I also asked to leave 10-minutes early last week (use 10-minutes of my unpaid break) to attend an appointment, which was met with discontent from my manager. Cue this week and the email that followed. \\n\\nNow, this would be a reasonable policy *if* there was any form of wage theft (Edit: wrong term; should be time theft, not wage theft) happening, but it\\'s the complete opposite. They are well aware that their employees are working through their lunch breaks and working over time to stay on top of the high workload and essentially providing them with free labour. Therefore, demanding employees come in early and remain strapped to their desks until the clock strikes at the end of the workday is not a reasonable policy. It\\'s just demeaning and glossing over the fact that they are getting free labour on a daily basis from dedicated employees. \\n\\nSo today, as a response to this email, I took my full 1-hour break for the first time in literally months. I sat in the break room on my phone for 1-hour. This resulted in the manager walking past, seeing me doing this, and looking very unimpressed. They\\'re used to seeing me sitting in my office, working in between bites of food as a break. They walked past a second time while I was still in the break room, this time completely avoiding my gaze. \\n\\nHaving maliciously complied today, I\\'ve decided what to do moving forward to continue this malicious compliance. From now on, I will come into work 5 minutes early and sit at my desk on my phone until my phone alarm signals that it\\'s time to start working. I will take my unpaid break for the full 1-hour during the day rather than sit at my desk working through this unpaid time. In a month, when they are used to me taking my full unpaid break, I will work through the day and take my 1-hour unpaid break exactly 1-hour before the end of my work day, meaning I will not return to the office after my break because my work day has ended (there is nothing in our contract that dictates when we can or can\\'t take our break). \\n\\nI have and will continue to maliciously comply, denying them the free labour they took for granted and fully utilising my unpaid personal time. \\n\\n[An update: Want to demand employees come in early to work without pay and stay strapped to their desks until the clock strikes time off? You got it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/w4fixg/an_update_want_to_demand_employees_come_in_early/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) today \\n\\nFirst of all, I have to admit I didn\\'t stay true to my initial malicious compliance. I did take full lunch breaks for a while and have continued taking regular lunch breaks, but I should stick to taking it for the full unpaid hour every single day which I\\'m stupidly not doing. Usually, it\\'s maybe a 20 minute lunch break. I know, I know. I\\'m slowly getting better with the help of my partner who repeatedly reminds me I\\'m allowing myself to be taken advantage of by my employer. \\n\\nMy partner has also been on my back about working unpaid overtime. As an example, I think I might have worked approx. 7hrs overtime last week (he would say more), after work at home on my laptop, just getting some client affairs in order. Not good, I know. I\\'m taking in everything my partner says and haven\\'t worked any overtime this week because of his support. I know I have a problem and this industry exacerbates it for their benefit alone. Keeping in mind, the program we use at work tracks all our usage, so work has a record of how much overtime my coworkers and I undertake. \\n\\nIt\\'s not an excuse, however, I have an intense fear of failure and of disappointing others, which I think was instilled in me from a young age accidentally by my parents. So it\\'s difficult for me to not be submissive and do everything I can to please others, particularly authority figures like employees. \\n\\nI\\'ve been coming in early every shift, as per the original post where they\\'ve said we have to, even though we aren\\'t paid to. Sometimes during the spare time I have in the morning, I\\'ll read work emails. Other times I sit on my phone until my work day commences - depends on my morning mood. \\n\\nFor maybe the last 2-3 weeks, I\\'ve been \"slacking off\" on arriving early, and instead of arriving 10-15 mins early, I\\'ve been arriving approx. 5 minutes early, getting a cup of tea (which takes 1-2 minutes max because they have instant hot water) and am at my desk with 1 or 2 minutes to spare. This office wide email was sent from HR just a few days ago:\\n\\n\\n**Titled:** Employee Work Hours \\n\\n*\"Just a reminder about your working hours.\\xa0You need to be at work and settled to start the day at your start time of 8am; computer on, coffee made etc.\\xa0 Please ensure you aren’t walking in with only a couple of minutes to spare otherwise it will set the tone for the day.\"* \\n\\nMy blood is literally boiling. Again, this is obviously about me. These greedy pigs are getting enough free labour from me and my coworkers to pay for another full time employee, yet they want to nitpick about me/us not being at work over 5 minutes early unpaid because it, *what*, shows a semblance of being a human rather than being a robot? \\n\\nAt this stage, my partner is saying I should just quit - that it doesn\\'t matter if I\\'m unemployed for a time, so long as I\\'m not working for these people (have been looking for other jobs with no success unfortunately). \\n\\nHe\\'s also signed me up for a union.

It can also be another wallet address that you own (ie. a MetaMask that already has Loopring L2 activated) that can send funds as a \"transfer\" on L2 to your new address in order to activate it.\\n\\nFor a VIDEO Guide on how to make an L2 transfer from a MetaMask wallet, see:\\n\\n👉 https://youtu.be/wITtqTlYERI\\n\\n🌟 **NOTE**\\nCurrently there is no fee charged to activate your Loopring L2 account (see #1️⃣  above) - there is only a minimum deposit required of 50 LRC - but whatever funds that are sent to your new address will appear in your new L2 wallet once activated (less the minimal L2 transfer fee) - but this may change in the future. \\n\\n---\\n\\n3️⃣ **I have funds on Coinbase (or another CEX), how do I get them to the new CF wallet?**\\n\\n⭐ **NOTE** \\nUsing Ethereum to transfer your funds is the safest and most trust-less way to transfer funds, however, there are trusted bridges set up now that simplify this process + make it cheaper to transfer your funds from CEX > Loopring L2, but they are trusted solutions that carry some temporary custody risk as a trade-off.\\n\\n➡️ Check #5️⃣ in the Counterfactual Wallet FAQ section for a quick guide.\\n\\n👇\\n\\nIf you still want to use Ethereum, the process would be:\\n\\nCoinbase > MetaMask (L1) > MetaMask (L2) > CF wallet (L2) 👇\\n\\nFollow the instructions in this VIDEO GUIDE below to set up and activate a free MetaMask wallet on Loopring L2 + transfer your funds from Coinbase to your Loopring L2 account:\\n\\n👉 https://youtu.be/Cs__Wi-FI5A\\n\\nOnce you have the funds on your Loopring L2 account (using MetaMask), you will then need to download the mobile Loopring Smart Wallet app + set up your CF wallet using the \"Ask a Friend\" activation method (see #2️⃣  above)\\n\\nYou can then use the \"Transfer\" function on the Loopring L2 app (using your MetaMask wallet) to transfer the funds to your new CF wallet address.\\n\\nWatch a VIDEO GUIDE on how to use the Transfer function here:\\n\\n👉 https://youtu.be/wITtqTlYERI \\n\\n---\\n\\n4️⃣ **I downloaded the Loopring wallet app previously + now have an expired verification code but I want to set up the new CF wallet... what do I do?**\\n\\nThis is one scenario where you should first delete the app completely and re-install it to clear the cache to get rid of the expired verification code before you try to set up the new Counterfactual Wallet (L2 only). \\n\\n**‼️ IMPORTANT**\\nIf you have previously sent funds to the wallet, you SHOULD NOT delete the app and reinstall it. If you do this, it will cost expensive gas-fees to recover your wallet.‼️ \\n\\nThe only scenario where you should delete the app + reinstall it is if you have never sent funds to the wallet before and just need to clear the cache of an expired verification code, so you can set up a new wallet from scratch.\\n\\nOnce you have cleared the cache, you should be free to now set up a new Counterfactual Wallet using the direct fiat on-ramp.\\n\\nIf you have any problems with the expired verification code, please fill out and submit a ticket to our support desk here (please only submit a ticket if you are having this exact issue and tried the above steps):\\n\\n👉 https://desk.zoho.com/portal/loopring/en/newticket\\n\\nIf you have created a new wallet but have an issue with a direct L2 fiat purchase using Ramp, please follow the instructions below.\\n\\n---\\n\\n5️⃣ **Can I set up a (Layer 2) CF wallet using funds from my Centralized Exchange (CEX) account (like Coinbase or Binance)?**\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThe simplest + cheapest way to do this currently, would be to use LayerSwap to move funds from your Centralized Exchange account (CEX) directly to your new L2 address once you\\'ve downloaded the wallet on your phone.\\n\\nCheck out this complete VIDEO GUIDE which will walk you through it step by step:\\n\\n👉 https://youtu.be/pD3gOCyhUjc\\n\\n⭐ **NOTE**\\nAs this is a new integration there are currently limits to how much can be transferred within one transaction. These limits will be increased shortly over time as well as the fees will be decreased as more volume flows through the bridge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#Please read through the below FAQ if you are having issues with the Fiat ramp\\n\\n---\\n\\n1️⃣ **What is a FIAT on-ramp / off-ramp?**\\n\\nFiat money is government-issued currency, and is the most widely adopted form of currency globally. The exchanging of fiat-to-crypto is the easiest method of gaining access to crypto. \\n\\nAn \"on-ramp\" is a service that allows a user to exchange fiat currencies (e.g. US dollars $, Great British Pound £, Euro € etc ) to crypto (e.g. ETH, USDC, LRC) directly (from a bank, debit or credit card).\\n\\nAn \"off-ramp\" is the same but going the opposite way (from crypto back to fiat).\\n\\nA fiat on-ramp (like our integrated RAMP * BANXA widgets) allows you to go from your bank account, debit card or credit card (jurisdiction dependent) directly to a Loopring L2 wallet, bypassing the need to transact on Ethereum L1 directly, saving the user from a bunch of gas-fees.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2️⃣ **Does Loopring hold my private data for on-ramp KYC?**\\n\\nThe simple answer is No.\\n\\nLoopring works with multiple fiat on-ramp providers to cover as many jurisdictions as possible. Know Your Customer (KYC) and other regulatory requirements will be handled by these third parties providing the on-ramp services and will never be known by Loopring.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3️⃣ **Which countries can currently use the fiat on-ramps?**\\n\\nFor the most up to date list of currently supported countries, please visit our on-ramp providers\\' websites here:\\n\\nRAMP country support:\\n\\n👉 https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/433-what-countries-do-you-support\\n\\nBANXA country support:\\n\\n👉 https://support.banxa.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002216505-what-countries-are-supported-by-banxa\\n\\n---\\n\\n4️⃣ **What fees are included in the fiat on-ramps?**\\n\\nThere are currently 3 small fees included in your fiat on-ramp deposit:\\n\\n✅ a fee charged by the provider of the service\\n\\n✅ a network fee for covering the blockchain transaction cost\\n\\n✅ a fee paid to liquidity providers on L2 for the fiat to cryptocurrency conversion direct to your L2 wallet\\n\\n🌟 **NOTE**\\nAll-in-all these fees add up to a small fraction of the cost of the previous onboarding process of going from CEX (centralized exchange) > Ethereum L1 > Loopring L2, which would incur fiat conversion charges + 2 separate gas-fees on Ethereum\\n\\nYou can check out screenshots here to clearly see the purchasing process for both RAMP and BANXA:\\n\\n👉 https://desk.zoho.com/portal/loopring/en/kb/articles/are-there-any-fees-for-using-the-fiat-on-ramp \\n\\n---\\n\\n5️⃣ **What are the payment options for the fiat on-ramps?**\\n\\nThere are many payment options to choose from depending on your durisdiction and fiat provioder (RAMP or BANXA).\\n\\nSome of the most popular payment methods include:\\n\\n✅ Easy Bank Transfer\\n\\n✅ Manual Bank Transfer\\n\\n✅ Card Payment (debit/credit)\\n\\n✅ Interac\\n\\n✅ Apply Pay \\n\\n✅ many more\\n\\nYou can find more details about payment for RAMP here:\\n\\n👉 https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/434-what-are-your-payment-options\\n\\nor\\n\\n👉 https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/433-what-countries-do-you-support\\n\\nYou can find more details about payment for BANXA here:\\n\\n👉 https://support.banxa.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002216515-what-payment-methods-can-i-use-with-banxa\\n\\n---\\n\\n6️⃣ **How long does a fiat on-ramp transaction take? Can I track my purchases?**\\n\\nDepending upon the funding method used, the transaction can take anything from a few minutes, for fast payment options such as those supporting Easy Bank Payments and Card payments, to a working day if it is a manual bank transfer.\\n\\nMore details for RAMP here:\\n\\n👉 https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/436-how-long-does-it-take-to-settle-the-transaction\\n\\nMore details for BANXA here:\\n\\n👉 https://support.banxa.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002225662-how-long-will-it-take-to-get-my-cryptocurrency\\n\\nTo track your transactions + crypto purchases, please visit our support page for a complete step by step guide:\\n\\n👉 https://desk.zoho.com/portal/loopring/en/kb/articles/how-long-does-the-fiat-on-ramp-transaction-take-and-how-can-i-track-it \\n\\n---\\n\\n7️⃣ **Who do I contact if I have an issue with my fiat on-ramp transaction?**\\n\\nThe fiat on-ramps are provided by a third party (RAMP or BANXA). Any queries related to your fiat on-ramp transaction should be directed towards them in the first instance.\\n\\nYou can contact RAMP via the widget using to \"Chat with us\" button or reach out to them on email:\\n\\n👉 support@ramp.network\\n\\nor more details can be found about RAMPs support here:\\n\\n👉 https://ramp.network/terms-of-service/#customer-support-and-complaints-handling-policy\\n\\nYou can contact BANXA by reaching out to them directly by submitting a ticket here:\\n\\n👉 https://support.banxa.com/en/support/tickets/new\\n\\n---\\n\\n8️⃣ **Is there a fiat off-ramp?**\\n\\nAn off-ramp is expected to roll out sometime in 2022.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#For step-by-step instructions about how to use Loopring\\'s products, please visit our [Knowledge Base](https://desk.zoho.com/portal/loopring/en/kb/loopring).\\n\\n#If you need assistance, please stop by our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/loopring) server.', 'comments': [\"First of all, thank you very much for answering many of the questions I had, I was looking for a post exactly like this one a few hours ago. \\n\\nI have a follow up question, since there is no off-ramp yet, how would I be able to sell any of my LRC that is stored on an L2-Wallet?

As promised we have checked with our specialist team.

I have a $500 paper weight sitting on my desk.\\n\\n**Updates:**\\n\\nI wanted to provide a couple of updates based on some of the comments.\\n\\n* The phone was not purchased by Google, but through mint mobile.  Mint is pawning the issue to Google, as they state that their warranty is straight from the manufacture.  Their RMA page did not work, and this is the response I got from them when reaching out to the support:[https://imgur.com/lCnqZJT](https://imgur.com/lCnqZJT)\\n* Regardless, Google should honor the warranty when bought through a third party reseller, as stated clearly on their website:[https://support.google.com/store/answer/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer](https://support.google.com/store/answer/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer)[https://imgur.com/1JZKlrL](https://imgur.com/1JZKlrL)\\n* Some have suggested that I go into a uBreakFix and have them deal with it.  I tried that already, they sent me away saying I need a warranty claim number from Google for them to work on it.\\n* No the phone was NOT damaged\\n* Even if the warranty was not valid for some reason, Google should at least give an explanation for why, not jus this BS answer of \"its not eligible, because its not eligible\"\\n* Because no modern day human can go without a cellphone, I had to go buy a new phone in the meantime.  I went with a OnePlus and have been very pleased with it, for far less money than the Google Pixel.  So at this point a replacement would be nothing but a waste of my life, as I would have to sell it to get my money back.  The hours of my life that are lost are a separate issue, which also has me bitter over this entire experience.\\n* To those accusing me of lying about talking to Google on the phone, there IS an option for them to call you when chatting with support.  Check your facts before making accusations:[https://imgur.com/Q2jvTh2](https://imgur.com/Q2jvTh2)\\n\\n**Final Update 12/14/2022:**\\n\\nThanks to the help of u/dmziggy I finally got a replacement from Google.  However I am still stuck because I had to buy a new phone in the meantime, so its still a loss for me.  I am going to sell the phone, but I won\\'t get back what I paid.  Because of this, I will be leaving this post up as a mar on Google\\'s reputation which is well deserved.

It has been exactly 3 months now trying to get my money back. What is the problem here? I am losing my patience, how would you like it if a company locked your account and wouldn’t give you your $100,000 back? Why did you accept the wire transfer only to close my account a minute later and make me fight for my money? If within the minutes of you accepting the wire transfer and locking the account, that means you knew that you shouldn’t have accepted it. You guys are playing with me. It doesn’t take a month to review 5 pages of info and send a wire transfer. Do I need to buy a plane ticket and pay you a visit? Email doesn’t seem to be working too well. I have a cousin in California who is a judge as well and will take legal action. I didn’t want to play this card but I have no choice left, if this goes for another week. I want my money back. And where is the harm in sending back money exactly where it came from? I really don’t see why you have dragged this on for so long. Am I being targeted being over 80 years old? Are you waiting for me to die to keep the money?\\xa0  \\n>  \\n>Don’t give me a one sentence response. I want full detail of the matter and an estimation of when that money will be back in the Ryan Electric bank account. For all I know, I am getting bullshitted by you guys, and you may not even be doing anything to fix this. Just keep dragging it on for another year, maybe I’ll be dead by then.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWell well well, you send them a nasty letter and they are right on top of it.\\n\\n> Hi-  \\n  \\n>  \\n>I\\'m really sorry about the delay here, somehow this ticket was pushed back in our queue. We are definitely handling this and I reminded the team as well. They did ask for one more thing, can you get a note from your bank stating that the R\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Electric corporate account was closed? We will need that to proceed. I will be handling this going forward, don\\'t hesitate in asking questions and I\\'ll make sure I answer them in a timely manner. Thank you and again, apologies on the delay here.\\xa0  \\n  \\n>  \\n>Best,  \\n>  \\n>Biggs  \\nBinance.US Support\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis dude is acting like he is here to help, and he had us fooled. Anyways we apologized for that email.\\n\\n> Thanks Biggs. Sorry for my rant, I appreciate the response. The R\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Electric Corporate bank account is still open as I am still chasing invoices from when I was in business. The business itself is closed.\\xa0 \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**November 23rd:**\\n\\n> Hi,  \\n  \\n>  \\n>It\\'s completely understandable. I need to follow up with the other team, just left them a memo and will touch base when I hear back.

Sent him an email.\\n\\n> When I go to the wire withdraw page, it has my name locked in and I can\\'t change it to R\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Electric. Should I just wire it to my Greenwood Credit Union account instead, or do you think the wire will work with my name? \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n> Greenwood Credit Union sounds like your best bet then.\\xa0  \\n  \\n>  \\n>Best,  \\n>  \\n>Biggs  \\nBinance.US Support\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo we try it, and it\\'s not working, we sent an email to him again.\\n\\n> I started the wire, but I haven\\'t received the confirmation email from Prime Trust. It\\'s been around 20 minutes, checked my spam and everything. I added\\xa0[info@primetrust.com](mailto:info@primetrust.com)\\xa0to my contacts, not sure if that is the email to whitelist or not. Should I try to do another wire withdrawal? \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHis response\\n\\n> I just asked the team if they sent one out or not, I will let you know what I hear.\\xa0  \\n  \\n>  \\n>Best,  \\n>  \\n>Biggs  \\nBinance.US Support\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**November 25th:**\\n\\nWire isn\\'t working, tried a bunch of things but the confirmation email never gets sent to confirm and start the withdrawal. \\n\\n> Hey, I went to the account and under withdrawals it said failed, but like I mentioned I never got the email to confirm it. I tried again, and the same thing is happening. I attached some screenshots. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**November 27th:** \\n\\n>Hey Biggs, I’m not sure what to do about the wire transfer. I triple checked all the information and I know it’s correct. It knows the bank name automatically once I enter the information, which means to me the routing number is correct. It says failed under the status for each try I did. Even right after I put the info in, I never seen it say pending, or open, just failed. I’m not getting the email to confirm that I want to withdraw, so I don’t think your team will ever get it.\\xa0I tried to use the checking account number instead of my savings and that didn’t work either. I can’t change the name of the wire\\xa0to try to send it to the R\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Electric account, so I’m not sure what I should do. If you would let me buy DAI then get off your exchange, that would work, but don’t know the legality of that. Let me know, it’s been over that 72hr limit and I’m not sure what to do here.\\xa0\\xa0  \\n>  \\n>Thanks\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHis response\\n\\n> Hi, still looking for a solution here, don\\'t worry I\\'ll make sure it gets handled.

I didn\\'t try to do ACH originally because my grandparents are scared of online banking. I sent this email asking about doing ACH and if it is alright, and in the mean time, convicted my grandparents to sign up for online banking with Washington Trust, since that was the only bank that they have that was on Biances ACH list.\\n\\nMind you the account has been active now for a couple months, with withdrawals only enabled.\\n\\n**December 6th:**\\n\\n>Hey Biggs, my money is still on the exchange and wire withdrawals don\\'t work it seems. Is there a way to maybe go straight to Prime Trust to withdraw it? I see there is ACH, as well, not something I really want to do, but would it work if I setup online banking with Washington Trust? Or would it not work since my account is limited?  \\n>  \\n>Thanks\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**NO RESPONSE AT ALL BUT THEY FUCKING DEACTIVED THE ACCOUNT RIGHT AFTER THAT EMAIL ASKING ABOUT AN ALTERNATE WAY TO GET THE MONEY OFF THE EXCHANGE**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**December 7th:**\\n\\n>Hey, I am looking to talk to Biggs. I just got my online banking setup with Washington Trust, and now my account is disabled with the $100,000 on there. I was just logged in yesterday.

I need to get my money off the exchange, and I have been trying wire withdrawals at different times, and none of them worked. I never got the confirmation email, on 5 or more tries. I tried different banks, and accounts, nothing. I never heard back about it either. I never done online banking, but I saw ACH on the withdrawals page, and since wire isn\\'t working, I decided to bite the bullet and enable my online banking with Washington Trust.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>My account has been limited from trading for over a month now, and only had it enabled to withdraw, which never worked with the wire method. I never got help form you guys, after sending multiple emails.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>A couple days ago, I emailed you guys about trying this ACH transfer, asking if it would work. In the meantime I went ahead and got online banking setup anyway. The very next day my account is locked. Having it limited for months, then me emailing you the day before, asking about me trying ACH, then having the account DISABLED just before I got setup with my bank for online banking, looks like a scam. A lot of actions over the past 5 months have seemed like a scam.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>What happened to Biggs taking this ticket personally until I got settled? Seems after I never got confirmation emails from the wire withdrawals, and adding Prime Trust to my email contracts/whitelist didn\\'t work, he just stopped talking to me.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>Last time I was ignored, I had to send a nasty email to you guys, then all of a sudden I started to get help. Then I cooled down, and yet again you guys are ignoring me.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>This has been quite a few emails now without a response.  \\n  \\n>  \\n>Get back to me soon, or I will have to take legal action.

Original post but u/llizardqueen in r/MaliciousCompliance This is my first BORU post, though I\\'m a long time lurker. LMK if I messed anything up. \\n\\n\\n\\n[Want to demand employees come in early without pay and stay strapped to their desks until the clock strikes time off? You got it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/tkqu2c/want_to_demand_employees_come_in_early_without/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) 4 months ago \\n\\nI work in a demanding industry. As a result, barely anyone in my department takes their unpaid 1-hour lunch break in full or at all, including myself. Most everyone just eats at their desk while working, including me. A lot of people work unpaid overtime as well, including me (for me, it was about 1-2 hours this week on my day off unpaid overtime to get on top of the work). The manager/boss know this happens - they see it occur on a daily basis, but don\\'t contest it because, you know, free labour. \\n\\nRecently, the boss sent around an office wide email \"for a select few\" that stated, \"work hours are work hours\". The email said they expect everyone to be at work 10-15 (unpaid) minutes early to \"get a coffee\" and start work on the dot. They also said that the end of your work shift is when you stop working and that you can\\'t pack up anything prior ie. If you have a cup on your desk, you have to wait until your work ends on the dot to put it in the dishwasher. Doing this 2 minute task prior to the end of your shift is not acceptable. There was more to the email, but it\\'s not relevant to this post. \\n\\nI\\'m certain this email is partially directed at me, because I arrive to work only a few minutes early, grab a cup of tea (takes 1 minute - they have instant hot water) and then start working. I also asked to leave 10-minutes early last week (use 10-minutes of my unpaid break) to attend an appointment, which was met with discontent from my manager. Cue this week and the email that followed. \\n\\nNow, this would be a reasonable policy *if* there was any form of wage theft (Edit: wrong term; should be time theft, not wage theft) happening, but it\\'s the complete opposite. They are well aware that their employees are working through their lunch breaks and working over time to stay on top of the high workload and essentially providing them with free labour. Therefore, demanding employees come in early and remain strapped to their desks until the clock strikes at the end of the workday is not a reasonable policy. It\\'s just demeaning and glossing over the fact that they are getting free labour on a daily basis from dedicated employees. \\n\\nSo today, as a response to this email, I took my full 1-hour break for the first time in literally months. I sat in the break room on my phone for 1-hour. This resulted in the manager walking past, seeing me doing this, and looking very unimpressed. They\\'re used to seeing me sitting in my office, working in between bites of food as a break. They walked past a second time while I was still in the break room, this time completely avoiding my gaze. \\n\\nHaving maliciously complied today, I\\'ve decided what to do moving forward to continue this malicious compliance. From now on, I will come into work 5 minutes early and sit at my desk on my phone until my phone alarm signals that it\\'s time to start working. I will take my unpaid break for the full 1-hour during the day rather than sit at my desk working through this unpaid time. In a month, when they are used to me taking my full unpaid break, I will work through the day and take my 1-hour unpaid break exactly 1-hour before the end of my work day, meaning I will not return to the office after my break because my work day has ended (there is nothing in our contract that dictates when we can or can\\'t take our break). \\n\\nI have and will continue to maliciously comply, denying them the free labour they took for granted and fully utilising my unpaid personal time. \\n\\n[An update: Want to demand employees come in early to work without pay and stay strapped to their desks until the clock strikes time off? You got it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/w4fixg/an_update_want_to_demand_employees_come_in_early/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) today \\n\\nFirst of all, I have to admit I didn\\'t stay true to my initial malicious compliance. I did take full lunch breaks for a while and have continued taking regular lunch breaks, but I should stick to taking it for the full unpaid hour every single day which I\\'m stupidly not doing. Usually, it\\'s maybe a 20 minute lunch break. I know, I know. I\\'m slowly getting better with the help of my partner who repeatedly reminds me I\\'m allowing myself to be taken advantage of by my employer. \\n\\nMy partner has also been on my back about working unpaid overtime. As an example, I think I might have worked approx. 7hrs overtime last week (he would say more), after work at home on my laptop, just getting some client affairs in order. Not good, I know. I\\'m taking in everything my partner says and haven\\'t worked any overtime this week because of his support. I know I have a problem and this industry exacerbates it for their benefit alone. Keeping in mind, the program we use at work tracks all our usage, so work has a record of how much overtime my coworkers and I undertake. \\n\\nIt\\'s not an excuse, however, I have an intense fear of failure and of disappointing others, which I think was instilled in me from a young age accidentally by my parents. So it\\'s difficult for me to not be submissive and do everything I can to please others, particularly authority figures like employees. \\n\\nI\\'ve been coming in early every shift, as per the original post where they\\'ve said we have to, even though we aren\\'t paid to. Sometimes during the spare time I have in the morning, I\\'ll read work emails. Other times I sit on my phone until my work day commences - depends on my morning mood. \\n\\nFor maybe the last 2-3 weeks, I\\'ve been \"slacking off\" on arriving early, and instead of arriving 10-15 mins early, I\\'ve been arriving approx. 5 minutes early, getting a cup of tea (which takes 1-2 minutes max because they have instant hot water) and am at my desk with 1 or 2 minutes to spare. This office wide email was sent from HR just a few days ago:\\n\\n\\n**Titled:** Employee Work Hours \\n\\n*\"Just a reminder about your working hours.\\xa0You need to be at work and settled to start the day at your start time of 8am; computer on, coffee made etc.\\xa0 Please ensure you aren’t walking in with only a couple of minutes to spare otherwise it will set the tone for the day.\"* \\n\\nMy blood is literally boiling. Again, this is obviously about me. These greedy pigs are getting enough free labour from me and my coworkers to pay for another full time employee, yet they want to nitpick about me/us not being at work over 5 minutes early unpaid because it, *what*, shows a semblance of being a human rather than being a robot? \\n\\nAt this stage, my partner is saying I should just quit - that it doesn\\'t matter if I\\'m unemployed for a time, so long as I\\'m not working for these people (have been looking for other jobs with no success unfortunately). \\n\\nHe\\'s also signed me up for a union.

It can also be another wallet address that you own (ie. a MetaMask that already has Loopring L2 activated) that can send funds as a \"transfer\" on L2 to your new address in order to activate it.\\n\\nFor a VIDEO Guide on how to make an L2 transfer from a MetaMask wallet, see:\\n\\n👉 https://youtu.be/wITtqTlYERI\\n\\n🌟 **NOTE**\\nCurrently there is no fee charged to activate your Loopring L2 account (see #1️⃣  above) - there is only a minimum deposit required of 50 LRC - but whatever funds that are sent to your new address will appear in your new L2 wallet once activated (less the minimal L2 transfer fee) - but this may change in the future. \\n\\n---\\n\\n3️⃣ **I have funds on Coinbase (or another CEX), how do I get them to the new CF wallet?**\\n\\n⭐ **NOTE** \\nUsing Ethereum to transfer your funds is the safest and most trust-less way to transfer funds, however, there are trusted bridges set up now that simplify this process + make it cheaper to transfer your funds from CEX > Loopring L2, but they are trusted solutions that carry some temporary custody risk as a trade-off.\\n\\n➡️ Check #5️⃣ in the Counterfactual Wallet FAQ section for a quick guide.\\n\\n👇\\n\\nIf you still want to use Ethereum, the process would be:\\n\\nCoinbase > MetaMask (L1) > MetaMask (L2) > CF wallet (L2) 👇\\n\\nFollow the instructions in this VIDEO GUIDE below to set up and activate a free MetaMask wallet on Loopring L2 + transfer your funds from Coinbase to your Loopring L2 account:\\n\\n👉 https://youtu.be/Cs__Wi-FI5A\\n\\nOnce you have the funds on your Loopring L2 account (using MetaMask), you will then need to download the mobile Loopring Smart Wallet app + set up your CF wallet using the \"Ask a Friend\" activation method (see #2️⃣  above)\\n\\nYou can then use the \"Transfer\" function on the Loopring L2 app (using your MetaMask wallet) to transfer the funds to your new CF wallet address.\\n\\nWatch a VIDEO GUIDE on how to use the Transfer function here:\\n\\n👉 https://youtu.be/wITtqTlYERI \\n\\n---\\n\\n4️⃣ **I downloaded the Loopring wallet app previously + now have an expired verification code but I want to set up the new CF wallet... what do I do?**\\n\\nThis is one scenario where you should first delete the app completely and re-install it to clear the cache to get rid of the expired verification code before you try to set up the new Counterfactual Wallet (L2 only). \\n\\n**‼️ IMPORTANT**\\nIf you have previously sent funds to the wallet, you SHOULD NOT delete the app and reinstall it. If you do this, it will cost expensive gas-fees to recover your wallet.‼️ \\n\\nThe only scenario where you should delete the app + reinstall it is if you have never sent funds to the wallet before and just need to clear the cache of an expired verification code, so you can set up a new wallet from scratch.\\n\\nOnce you have cleared the cache, you should be free to now set up a new Counterfactual Wallet using the direct fiat on-ramp.\\n\\nIf you have any problems with the expired verification code, please fill out and submit a ticket to our support desk here (please only submit a ticket if you are having this exact issue and tried the above steps):\\n\\n👉 https://desk.zoho.com/portal/loopring/en/newticket\\n\\nIf you have created a new wallet but have an issue with a direct L2 fiat purchase using Ramp, please follow the instructions below.\\n\\n---\\n\\n5️⃣ **Can I set up a (Layer 2) CF wallet using funds from my Centralized Exchange (CEX) account (like Coinbase or Binance)?**\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThe simplest + cheapest way to do this currently, would be to use LayerSwap to move funds from your Centralized Exchange account (CEX) directly to your new L2 address once you\\'ve downloaded the wallet on your phone.\\n\\nCheck out this complete VIDEO GUIDE which will walk you through it step by step:\\n\\n👉 https://youtu.be/pD3gOCyhUjc\\n\\n⭐ **NOTE**\\nAs this is a new integration there are currently limits to how much can be transferred within one transaction. These limits will be increased shortly over time as well as the fees will be decreased as more volume flows through the bridge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#Please read through the below FAQ if you are having issues with the Fiat ramp\\n\\n---\\n\\n1️⃣ **What is a FIAT on-ramp / off-ramp?**\\n\\nFiat money is government-issued currency, and is the most widely adopted form of currency globally. The exchanging of fiat-to-crypto is the easiest method of gaining access to crypto. \\n\\nAn \"on-ramp\" is a service that allows a user to exchange fiat currencies (e.g. US dollars $, Great British Pound £, Euro € etc ) to crypto (e.g. ETH, USDC, LRC) directly (from a bank, debit or credit card).\\n\\nAn \"off-ramp\" is the same but going the opposite way (from crypto back to fiat).\\n\\nA fiat on-ramp (like our integrated RAMP * BANXA widgets) allows you to go from your bank account, debit card or credit card (jurisdiction dependent) directly to a Loopring L2 wallet, bypassing the need to transact on Ethereum L1 directly, saving the user from a bunch of gas-fees.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2️⃣ **Does Loopring hold my private data for on-ramp KYC?**\\n\\nThe simple answer is No.\\n\\nLoopring works with multiple fiat on-ramp providers to cover as many jurisdictions as possible. Know Your Customer (KYC) and other regulatory requirements will be handled by these third parties providing the on-ramp services and will never be known by Loopring.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3️⃣ **Which countries can currently use the fiat on-ramps?**\\n\\nFor the most up to date list of currently supported countries, please visit our on-ramp providers\\' websites here:\\n\\nRAMP country support:\\n\\n👉 https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/433-what-countries-do-you-support\\n\\nBANXA country support:\\n\\n👉 https://support.banxa.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002216505-what-countries-are-supported-by-banxa\\n\\n---\\n\\n4️⃣ **What fees are included in the fiat on-ramps?**\\n\\nThere are currently 3 small fees included in your fiat on-ramp deposit:\\n\\n✅ a fee charged by the provider of the service\\n\\n✅ a network fee for covering the blockchain transaction cost\\n\\n✅ a fee paid to liquidity providers on L2 for the fiat to cryptocurrency conversion direct to your L2 wallet\\n\\n🌟 **NOTE**\\nAll-in-all these fees add up to a small fraction of the cost of the previous onboarding process of going from CEX (centralized exchange) > Ethereum L1 > Loopring L2, which would incur fiat conversion charges + 2 separate gas-fees on Ethereum\\n\\nYou can check out screenshots here to clearly see the purchasing process for both RAMP and BANXA:\\n\\n👉 https://desk.zoho.com/portal/loopring/en/kb/articles/are-there-any-fees-for-using-the-fiat-on-ramp \\n\\n---\\n\\n5️⃣ **What are the payment options for the fiat on-ramps?**\\n\\nThere are many payment options to choose from depending on your durisdiction and fiat provioder (RAMP or BANXA).\\n\\nSome of the most popular payment methods include:\\n\\n✅ Easy Bank Transfer\\n\\n✅ Manual Bank Transfer\\n\\n✅ Card Payment (debit/credit)\\n\\n✅ Interac\\n\\n✅ Apply Pay \\n\\n✅ many more\\n\\nYou can find more details about payment for RAMP here:\\n\\n👉 https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/434-what-are-your-payment-options\\n\\nor\\n\\n👉 https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/433-what-countries-do-you-support\\n\\nYou can find more details about payment for BANXA here:\\n\\n👉 https://support.banxa.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002216515-what-payment-methods-can-i-use-with-banxa\\n\\n---\\n\\n6️⃣ **How long does a fiat on-ramp transaction take? Can I track my purchases?**\\n\\nDepending upon the funding method used, the transaction can take anything from a few minutes, for fast payment options such as those supporting Easy Bank Payments and Card payments, to a working day if it is a manual bank transfer.\\n\\nMore details for RAMP here:\\n\\n👉 https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/436-how-long-does-it-take-to-settle-the-transaction\\n\\nMore details for BANXA here:\\n\\n👉 https://support.banxa.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002225662-how-long-will-it-take-to-get-my-cryptocurrency\\n\\nTo track your transactions + crypto purchases, please visit our support page for a complete step by step guide:\\n\\n👉 https://desk.zoho.com/portal/loopring/en/kb/articles/how-long-does-the-fiat-on-ramp-transaction-take-and-how-can-i-track-it \\n\\n---\\n\\n7️⃣ **Who do I contact if I have an issue with my fiat on-ramp transaction?**\\n\\nThe fiat on-ramps are provided by a third party (RAMP or BANXA). Any queries related to your fiat on-ramp transaction should be directed towards them in the first instance.\\n\\nYou can contact RAMP via the widget using to \"Chat with us\" button or reach out to them on email:\\n\\n👉 support@ramp.network\\n\\nor more details can be found about RAMPs support here:\\n\\n👉 https://ramp.network/terms-of-service/#customer-support-and-complaints-handling-policy\\n\\nYou can contact BANXA by reaching out to them directly by submitting a ticket here:\\n\\n👉 https://support.banxa.com/en/support/tickets/new\\n\\n---\\n\\n8️⃣ **Is there a fiat off-ramp?**\\n\\nAn off-ramp is expected to roll out sometime in 2022.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#For step-by-step instructions about how to use Loopring\\'s products, please visit our [Knowledge Base](https://desk.zoho.com/portal/loopring/en/kb/loopring).\\n\\n#If you need assistance, please stop by our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/loopring) server.', 'comments': [\"First of all, thank you very much for answering many of the questions I had, I was looking for a post exactly like this one a few hours ago. \\n\\nI have a follow up question, since there is no off-ramp yet, how would I be able to sell any of my LRC that is stored on an L2-Wallet?
