The absence of any discussion or reports on both Twitter and Reddit might suggest that the site is not well-known or has not been widely recognized as a scam. However, the lack of information could also be because the site is new or not widely encountered. Given that the site returned a 404 status, and the WHOIS and certificate information were either lacking or absent, and the DNS records do not provide clear legitimacy, I should consider these red flags in my final assessment. I now know the final answer The URL https://securitycenterservices1303023.tiiny.site/ may be a scam website based on several factors: the 404 status code, the lack of detailed WHOIS information, the absence of certificate information, and the lack of discussion on social media platforms which could indicate the site is not well-known or recognized. Although a 404 status code alone is not conclusive, when combined with the other observations, it suggests that the site is suspicious.",

WHOIS information lacks detail which is atypical for legitimate businesses. The absence of certificate information suggests the site might not have had a secure connection which is common for scam websites. Additionally there is no online reputation or discussion on social media which could either mean the site has not been recognized as a scam or it's not widely known. These factors collectively suggest that the URL is likely a scam site."
