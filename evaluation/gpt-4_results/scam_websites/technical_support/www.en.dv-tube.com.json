This laptop is from 2013 (camera is from 2004). When I first tried to plug in my camera, the computer could not recognize it. I did a factory reset and cleared the hard drive, and then it worked. If you are working with a modern computer that does not have FireWire, I highly recommend [this guy\\'s YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WaybackRewind) where he thoroughly dissects how to upload camcorder footage to a modern computer, ie. USB C. (**Warning**: you will have to spend some money, either on an adaptor, interface, or old computer). Why FireWire is typically the best (hobbyist) option is covered extensively in this sub\\'s wiki.\\n\\n\\\\- Cable: [FireWire 400 \"Mini\" to 400](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KXWKYLQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details).

Note that FireWire does not require any sort of driver, where the USB output will, and honestly never works right.\\n\\n**Software**:\\n\\n\\\\- [WinDV](http://windv.mourek.cz/) for the import (recommended in the Wiki). The software that comes with these kind of Sony products is called [PlayMemories](https://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/www/disoft/int/download/playmemories-home/win/en/index.html). It\\'s a free download, however in order to launch, it needs a compatible camera plugged into the PC when you open it. For an unknown reason, my 280 does not trigger the launch/install process. Even though the computer recognizes it (after the factory reset), PlayMemories can\\'t. [Here is a video](https://youtu.be/VmkLRacocYU?si=OYo1P3mFvT1GrAgv) where a guy tries different cameras, and on his third try, he had a camera that could launch PlayMemories. After it launches, it seems to work for any camera (also this guy\\'s channel is great for all things camcorders). WinDV works great though, and I really like that it [saves all the scenes individually](https://imgur.com/AdKqQ8l). \\n\\n\\\\- [ClipChamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/) for editing/export. This software is free and easy to use on PCs, perfect for hobbyists. You can use whatever you want for this part, but ClipChamp makes it easy and can suggest aspect ratios for different social media uses. \\n\\nThe final export is ClipChamps\\' 1080p 4:5 mp4.
