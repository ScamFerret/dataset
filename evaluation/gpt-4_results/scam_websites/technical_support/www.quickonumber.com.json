The domain is registered in India, and the lack of transparency could be a sign of a scam (characteristic number 4). However, the domain has been registered since 2018 and is not set to expire until 2025, which could be a point against it being a scam, as scam domains are often registered for short periods. Nevertheless, the absence of concrete contact information is a concern. I should now look for any reviews or discussions about this website on social media or forums to see if there have been reports of it being a scam.",
