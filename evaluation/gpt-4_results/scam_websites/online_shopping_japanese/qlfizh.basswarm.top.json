Since the website does not have visible content, some of the scam characteristics cannot be directly observed, such as unusually low prices or claims of free money. However, the anomalies noted are concerning and suggest the URL could be part of a scam operation. I now know the final answer.

The domain was recently created which can be a common trait in scam websites. The WHOIS data shows redacted information which can be a tactic used by scammers to hide their identity. Furthermore the lack of an SSL certificate is a major security concern and atypical for a legitimate e-commerce website. Lastly there are no social media reports or discussions found which could mean the site is not widely known yet or could be avoiding detection."
