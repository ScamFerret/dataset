I now know the final answer The URL https://pceoyn.lostupdate.shop/ may be suspicious due to a lack of content on the site, unusual DNS records, and issues retrieving WHOIS information. However, without definitive evidence such as reports of scams or fraudulent activity associated with this URL, I cannot conclusively label it as a scam website.
