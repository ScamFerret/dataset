This is not uncommon, but it can be a red flag in combination with other suspicious factors. The domain was created recently, which can also be a sign of a scam website. It's also notable that it's registered in China, which can sometimes be associated with scam operations, although this alone is not conclusive.

Since this website does not have a certificate, it could be potentially dangerous for visitors to enter any personal information. This is a strong indicator of a scam website. Given the lack of information, the discrepancy between the status code and the nginx 404 error, the recent creation date, and the lack of SSL/TLS certificate, I am leaning towards classifying the website as a scam.

The WHOIS data shows the domain was recently created and has privacy redactions which can indicate a scam setup especially in combination with other factors. No SSL/TLS certificate information was found which suggests a lack of security for user data. These points meet the criteria for a scam website as they target human weaknesses (trust in seemingly legitimate web pages) display suspicious domain information and lack proper security measures."
