The status of the domain is ok, and there are no immediate red flags here, but the lack of detailed information means further investigation is necessary. Since there was a \"404 Not Found\" error, I am unable to analyze the content of the website directly, but I can still look for other signs of legitimacy or scam characteristics.

Considering the lack of certificate information, the newness of the domain, the 404 error, and the absence of discussions on social platforms, I have several indications that this website may not be trustworthy.

Considering all the observations: - The website returned a \"404 Not Found\" error, suggesting no content is available. - WHOIS information shows the domain is very new and registered in a region known for hosting scam websites. - There is a complete absence of SSL/TLS certificate information. - There is no discussion on social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter that could confirm or deny the website's legitimacy. - The DNS record includes an unusual HINFO record. These points, particularly the lack of SSL/TLS certificate information and the newness of the domain, are red flags. Although I have not observed direct scam characteristics due to the absence of website content, the signs point toward the website being potentially untrustworthy and possibly a scam. I now know the final answer. The URL https://slow.orsure.cfd/ is likely a scam website.",
