Since the WHOIS information shows that the domain is relatively new, and considering the lack of user feedback on social media, it is difficult to conclusively determine the legitimacy of the website based on the information available.

The use of these terms also targets psychological weaknesses as per scam characteristic #3. The domain is registered in China and was created recently which adds to the suspicion. Additionally there is a lack of public feedback on social media platforms which could suggest that the website is not well-known or has not been reported as a scam yet. Although the payment methods are not explicitly mentioned the overall presentation of the site raises enough red flags to suspect it may be a scam."
