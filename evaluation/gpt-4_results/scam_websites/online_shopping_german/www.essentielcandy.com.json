Given the observations from the website content, WHOIS data, and lack of online discussions explicitly labeling the site as a scam, I must make a determination based on the evidence I have. The combination of unusually low prices, claims of 100% guarantees, targeting psychological weaknesses, a recently created domain, privacy protection, and potential confusion with a similarly named legitimate site leads me to lean towards the possibility of \"essentielcandy.com\" being a scam. However, the lack of explicit scam reports means there's no definitive proof available to me. I now know the final answer.
