Spammers use this information to promote services to website owners. Some website owners therefor chose to hide their contact details. However, it can also be misused by scammers. Our algorithm gives a high rating if the identity of the website owner is shown. Webshop Evaluation In our Analysis we always check the Tranco ranking. In this case it was low. A low Tranco ranking means that the website has relatively few visitors. For a new website this is logical. The same is true for a highly specialized website. However if the website claims to be a large corporate or popular site, than warning flags should be raised. How to recognize a scam Technical Evaluation We found a valid SSL Certificate. An SSL certificate is used to secure communication between your computer and the website. There are different levels of SSL certification. A free one is also available and this one is used by online scammers. Still, not having an SSL certificate is worse than having one, especially if you have to enter your contact details.

        "thought": "The Scamadviser review for \"bube-dame.shop\" highlights several negative points: the website owner is hiding their identity on WHOIS using a paid service, the website does not have many visitors, and the domain has been registered recently. These are red flags that align with some characteristics of scam websites. Although there is a valid SSL certificate, as mentioned in the technical evaluation, this is not conclusive evidence of legitimacy since free SSL certificates can be used by scammers. Furthermore, the absence of customer reviews or online presence on social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter raises concerns. The WHOIS data indicates the owner is using a privacy service to hide their contact details, which can be a common practice for both legitimate privacy reasons and by scammers to avoid detection. Based on the observations and the characteristics of scam websites, it seems that \"bube-dame.shop\" exhibits several signs that could indicate it is a scam. The unusually low prices, claims of free shipping for a large number of items, lack of transparency in the owner's identity, recent domain registration, and the absence of an online presence or customer feedback support the conclusion that \"bube-dame.shop\" could likely be a scam. I now know the final answer. The URL \"https://bube-dame.shop/\" is likely a scam website.",
