I\\'ve been to pretty much every shop in the city at this point and have even come to know a few of the reps a bit, so I thought it might be fun to spend a day or two giving interested people the grand tour. \\n\\nI was thinking of maybe doing this in early-to-mid October, but thought I\\'d post it now to gauge interest, give people time to make any travel arrangements, etc. \\n\\nHere\\'s the list of where I think we ought to visit (note: this is really best done over a two-day span. Take it from experience):\\n\\n* Pasteur Pharmacy: In addition to being a wet-shaving mecca, they also carry quite a few fragrances, including the difficult-to-locate *Knize Ten* and its cousins *Knize Two* and *Knize Sec*\\n\\n* [Osswald](http://osswaldnyc.com): Osswald has a thing for the strange and unusual and Josie, their resident perfume expert, is about as knowledgeable a person as I\\'ve ever come across on the subject of fragrance. When I first met her last year, had I been in a position to do so, I would have offered her a job on the spot. She\\'s great.\\n\\n* [Twisted Lily](http://twistedlily.com): Twisted Lily is primarily staffed by Erik (the owner) and Anna (who comes in at #2 on my list of most knowledgeable perfume reps). They carry some unusual perfumes, including creations by Slumberhouse, Tauer Perfume, CB I Hate Perfume, and Charenton Macerations. It\\'s not a very big store, but it\\'s a really interesting place.\\n\\n* [Aedes de Venustas](http://www.aedes.com): I\\'m a little hesitant about this one. The last time I was in Aedes, I started asking them questions and they looked at me like some sort of unpleasant insect. Still, they carry some very interesting perfumes (including their own line) and the shop is regarded as one of the must-visit perfume locations in the city.\\n\\n* [Barney\\'s](http://www.barneys.com): Every Barney\\'s store has a different collection of niche perfumes (a fact on which the chain prides itself), but none so large as that of the flagship store in New York. I had a great time the last time I visited and the store is home to some unusual custom work done for the chain, such as the Hylnds line done by the founders of D.S. & Durga.\\n\\n* [Bergdorf Goodman](http://www.bergdorfgoodman.com): Home to the only Guerlain boutique in North America, Bergdorf is a place not to be missed, if only for its decor (it\\'s gorgeous). The Guerlain rep, Julie, is an absolute blast. \\n\\n* [MiN New York](http://min.com): Another store about which I\\'m a bit hesitant, MiN takes the view that they\\'re \"not really a store, but more curators of products.\" They\\'re kind of smug about this, but the shop itself is very interesting and has a relatively wide shaving/grooming selection as well. They recently launched their own line of perfumes, about which I\\'ve heard good things, but I haven\\'t sampled them myself.\\n\\n* Caron: The Caron boutique on Lexington Ave. is tiny, but contains the beautiful crystal urns for which the House is famous. Natasha (at least, I think that\\'s her name; I haven\\'t been there in nearly a year), the chief rep, is absolutely DELIGHTED when people come to visit (it\\'s kind of hard to find if you\\'ve never been there before) and loves to talk about the line.\\n\\n* [Enfleurage](http://www.enfleurage.com): Honestly, the place we should probably visit first. Enfleurage maintains a collection of natural isolates that\\'s virtually unrivaled and is a great place to become familiar with ingredients before you go and smell actual perfumes. \\n\\n* [C.O. Bigelow](http://www.bigelowchemists.com): In addition to their wet shaving products, Bigelow is the only shop in NYC that I know of that carries Geo F. Trumper fragrances, so it\\'s definitely worth a visit (and is pretty close to Aedes de Venustas).\\n\\nThere are a couple of brand-specific boutiques (Frederic Malle, Bond No. 9) that aren\\'t really worth visiting unless you\\'re SUPER interested in that particular line (though there\\'s an Atelier boutique right across from Twisted Lily that\\'s pretty neat), so we\\'d probably skip those. If anyone has suggestions for anything I\\'ve missed, I\\'d love to hear them. \\n\\nSo? What say you? Is anyone interested?\\n\\n**Edit**: To be clear, this would be on a weekend so that the maximum number of people could attend.', 'comments': [\"I'd totally be down if I wasn't getting married early mid-October.  \\n99 days (=\", 'Interested, but October is a bad time for me.', 'Is any experience or expertise required?', \"I don't post much but I only live a short ride from the city and I'm getting really interested in fragrances.

However, there is mention of a Biehl Parfumkunstwerke PC01 fragrance sold from Osswald in NYC, indicating that there could be a legitimate brick-and-mortar store with a similar name in New York City. This does not necessarily confirm the legitimacy of the online shop at osswald.shop, but it could be related. Before making a final decision, it would be prudent to look for additional information that could corroborate the legitimacy or fraudulence of the URL in question.",

I need to make my decision based on the information I have gathered so far. Based on the unusually high discounts mentioned on the website, the ambiguous information about the company, the error encountered when trying to retrieve WHOIS data, and the lack of comprehensive DNS records, I am inclined to suspect that osswald.shop may be a fraudulent site. However, the presence of a physical store with a similar name complicates the issue. Given the mixed indicators, I will proceed with caution and lean toward considering the site potentially fraudulent due to the significant discounts and free shipping offers that are characteristic of fraudulent sites. I now know the final answer. Based on the observations and the characteristics of fraudulent sites, I believe that osswald.shop has a high probability of being a fraudulent site.",

Additionally the WHOIS data could not be retrieved and the DNS records were insufficient which could indicate an attempt to hide the identity of the site's operators."
