This suggests that the privacy policy may not be adequately detailed or is missing entirely, which is a characteristic of scam websites. I now know the final answer based on the observations derived from the actions taken. The website shows several red flags, such as a very recent domain registration, lack of transparency in company information, and inadequate privacy policy details. These indicators, coupled with the absence of customer feedback or scam reports (which could be due to the newness of the domain), lead to the conclusion that the website is likely a scam.
