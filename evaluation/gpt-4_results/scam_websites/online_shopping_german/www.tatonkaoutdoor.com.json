Since I've gathered sufficient information but have not found explicit evidence of a scam, I will make a judgment based on the observed signs and the lack of transparency or user feedback. I now know the final answer. Based on the unusually high discounts offered, the lack of transparency regarding payment methods, the generic WHOIS information, and the absence of user feedback or discussions on social platforms, there are several indicators that could suggest tatonkaoutdoor.com is potentially a scam website.
