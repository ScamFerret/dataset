While privacy protection itself is not a definitive sign of a fraudulent site, it can be a red flag in combination with other suspicious factors. Additionally, the \"Updated Date\" showing 2024-03-28 suggests that the site may not have been updated recently or the date might be incorrect, which aligns with the \"Copyright 2024\" issue observed earlier.
