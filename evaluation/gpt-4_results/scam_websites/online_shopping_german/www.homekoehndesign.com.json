The platform provides only web performance and security, and not web hosting services. Cloudflare also partners with IBM Cloud and Google Cloud Platform, which means that the three organizations have many shared renowned clients. One of Cloudflare's most well-known offerings is its Domain Name Service (DNS), which incorporates security safeguards including a Web Application Firewall and a DDoS-blocker. Many trustworthy companies and platforms, including ScamAdviser, use the platform because of its established reputation; nevertheless, like everything else on the internet, scammers can still abuse it. Webshop Evaluation In our Analysis we always check the Tranco ranking. In this case it was low. A low Tranco ranking means that the website has relatively few visitors. For a new website this is logical. The same is true for a highly specialized website. However if the website claims to be a large corporate or popular site, than warning flags should be raised. How to recognize a scam Technical Evaluation We found a valid SSL Certificate. An SSL certificate is used to secure communication between your computer and the website. There are different levels of SSL certification. A free one is also available and this one is used by online scammers. Still, not having an SSL certificate is worse than having one, especially if you have to enter your contact details.
