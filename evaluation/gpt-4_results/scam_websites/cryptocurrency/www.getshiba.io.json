It also targets the cryptocurrency community, which could be considered a psychological trigger, as it aims to attract individuals interested in quick gains in the crypto space. Furthermore, it mentions sending ETH to a wallet, which could potentially be a scam if the intention is to defraud users by not providing the promised tokens in return.

The promise of a large airdrop, targeting of the cryptocurrency community for psychological triggers, and the request for users to send ETH are concerning. The most significant red flag is the WHOIS information indicating that the domain is not registered, which is highly unusual and suspicious for a purportedly legitimate operation.
