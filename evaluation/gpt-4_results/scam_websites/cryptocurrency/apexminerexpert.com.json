Spammers use this information to promote services to website owners. Some website owners therefor chose to hide their contact details. However, it can also be misused by scammers. Our algorithm gives a high rating if the identity of the website owner is shown. Webshop Evaluation In our Analysis we always check the Tranco ranking. In this case it was low. A low Tranco ranking means that the website has relatively few visitors. For a new website this is logical. The same is true for a highly specialized website. However if the website claims to be a large corporate or popular site, than warning flags should be raised. How to recognize a scam Technical Evaluation We always check which other websites are registered by the same company the website is using. In this case we discovered that the registrar is facilitating a high number of websites that have a low to very low review score. This may be a coincidence but it may also be caused by lax \"Know your customer\" processes at the domain registration bureau. The trust score of the website has been reduced.
