        "thought": "The text extracted from the URL contains several red flags that align with the characteristics of scam websites: 1. It offers unusually high returns with guaranteed profits, which is generally not possible in legitimate investment scenarios. 2. The investment plans offer huge returns in a very short time frame, like 100% after 48 hours, which is unrealistic and targets human psychological weaknesses. 3. The company claims to be officially registered, but this information can be fabricated. I need to verify the legitimacy of the company. 4. The payment methods include cryptocurrencies, which can be considered unusual as they allow for less traceable transactions. I should now verify the legitimacy of the company and check for other scam characteristics.",
