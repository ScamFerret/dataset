There are unusually high returns being promised (up to 5% every day), which is generally not possible in legitimate investments due to market volatility. The site also offers a variety of investment plans with escalating returns that could be targeting psychological weaknesses by encouraging larger deposits for higher returns. There is mention of instant withdrawals, which is unusual for investment platforms that typically have a processing time for withdrawals. The contact information includes a Gmail address and two phone numbers with different international codes, which may not be appropriate for a legitimate business.
