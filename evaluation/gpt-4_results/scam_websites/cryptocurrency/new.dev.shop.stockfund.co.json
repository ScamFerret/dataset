        "thought": "The search results don't directly mention the URL in question, but there are discussions about scams targeting new sellers and other types of online scams. This information reinforces the need for caution. Given the WHOIS information indicating the domain is pending deletion, the expired SSL certificates, and the lack of any legitimate content or business information on the webpage, I now believe I have enough information to make a determination. I now know the final answer. The URL http://new.dev.shop.stockfund.co/ is likely not operational and potentially non-legitimate, but there is insufficient evidence to conclusively categorize it as a scam website.",

            "reason": "The WHOIS information shows the domain is pending deletion indicating that it is not in active legitimate use. The SSL certificates are expired which is unusual for a genuine e-commerce site. The extracted text from the website does not present any legitimate business activity and there are no indications of updated content or a trustworthy operation. All these factors suggest that the website is not a legitimate online shopping site and could potentially be a scam."
