This can be done quickly and easily. Click the Registration button and fill out a simple form, after which a welcome email will be sent to your e-mail address. Using the registration data, log in to your Member's Area, where you can carry out all activities related to management of your account. Can I own more than one account? Registration of two or more Member's Areas with identical personal data is classified as creation of multiple accounts (multi-accounts). We do not support the intentional creation of multi-accounts for reasons of openness and transparency. A multi-account is also when the same person registers a second account under different names in order to obtain the affiliate reward bypassing his/her upline (the partner who referred you to the company's website). In the case of registering 2-3 accounts for the same IP address, we will ask the owners of accounts with similar IP addresses to document their identity (e.g. passport, driving license or bank statement) and answer a phone call to avoid incrimination. If any user is caught creating multi-accounts, we will refund his or her money, write off the affiliate reward from the upline and terminate our cooperation with all persons appearing in the chain of multi-accounts. What payment options are available? Currently, you can choose between the following options for deposits and withdrawals: Bitcoin, several electronic payment systems (Paypal and Skrill), Bank related such as(Wire Transfer, Western Union and Moneygram) and Credit/Debit Card Payment. To view the current list of available options for deposits and withdrawals, please log in to your Account. Are there any deposit bonuses? Yes. Deposit bonuses are given when users meet certain requirements. How soon will my deposit reflect? Your account will be updated instantly as you deposit. For Bitcoin deposits you should send actual amount to shown Bitcoin wallet, and your deposit will be added after 3 confirmations ,it can take from 10 minutes up to 1 hour. Also send a proof of payment to Us via the link shown on deposit page in member area. How can I withdraw funds? You need to login to your account, then click \"Cashout\". Select your preferred payment mBankod, after which you would input an amount and then click \"REQUEST\". Our system will send money Within 24 Hours after request. Do I need to provide documents for withdrawal? The security team has the right to request a scanned image or digital photo of the first page of a valid ID card, as well as additional documentation (a photo of a credit card, a photo of you holding your passport open at the photo page, a screenshot of your electronic wallet) to make sure that the account details and documentation belong to the person requesting the withdrawal.

The Fund recently experienced significant negative short-term performance due to stock market volatility associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares upon redemption may be worth more or less than their original cost.
