        "thought": "The text extracted from the website raises several red flags according to the scam characteristics provided: 1. The services offered, such as hacking and cryptocurrency recovery, are suspicious and could potentially be illegal. 2. The claims of high yielding profits with an AI bot for cryptocurrency investment are unrealistic and prey on the desire for easy money. 3. The text seems to target human psychological weaknesses like fear of losing digital assets or the desire to catch a cheating spouse. 4. There is no clear information about the company's legitimacy, history, or physical location. 5. The services offered are not common for a legitimate business, especially the hacking-related ones. 6. The email addresses provided seem generic and not representative of a professional company. 7. There is no clear privacy policy mentioned. I should now check the domain registration information to see if it aligns with a legitimate business.",
