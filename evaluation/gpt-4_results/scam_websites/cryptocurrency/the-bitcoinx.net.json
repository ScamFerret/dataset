BitcoinX Trading When Bitcoin was first introduced into the public markets in 2009, the world’s first cryptocurrency was barely noticed. However, there was a small group of innovation-minded investors who instantly recognized the great potential of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. These early investors eventually reaped huge rewards when Bitcoin attained record highs of just under $20,000 by 2017. Since then, after a brief downturn, Bitcoin has even surpassed that previous record and has been continuously climbing upwards. Is the BitcoinX a Scam?

You bought your Bitcoins in the first 10 years and you are glad you did. You help secure the network on your Computer Home (the thing that replaced the home computer), of course, just like millions of other HODLers. But you also just downloaded the BitcoinViz app to your Tesla VC (visual cortex) that replaced those clunky smart phones a few years ago. While commuting in the Hyper-hyper Loop, it's fun to watch the data visualization projected onto your retina as millions and millions of dollars move around the Bitcoin network every 10 minutes. And since there is only 1MB of data every 10 minutes and the blockchain is under a terabyte, why wouldn't you also store the full blockchain on your VC?\\n\\nSpenders:\\n\\nEvery day you make a couple of transactions with BitcoinX - the Bitcoin extension block network that was enabled in 2017. This is how you buy your coffee. This is how you buy your groceries and how you pay for the pack of old-school cannabis smokes the drone delivers you every Monday. You spend a few cents for these BitcoinX transactions so it's much cheaper than spending from your Bitcoin savings - which costs around $10 per transaction. You could spend from your savings if you want, but why would you spend an extra $10 on your $20 coffee - seems silly, right? And yeah, the security of BitcoinX isn't as good as where you store your life's savings, but in the last 8 years there haven't been any issues with BitcoinX. Yes, there was an attack in 2019 when BitcoinX was still kinda new but no one lost much money since no one stores much money on BitcoinX. Of course, the Bitcoin main chain was unaffected by the BitcoinX bug and kept chugging along perfectly as it has since March 2013 with 0 downtime. It seems funny to think back to the conversations of 2017 about Bitcoin extension blocks adding technical debt to Bitcoin - we haven't had any change to the core Bitcoin protocol in 9 years now. There are lots of libraries that implement Bitcoin in pretty much every computer language - even that new Holographic Fortran+++ (gotta learn that!).\\n\\nYou sometimes think about helping secure the BitcoinX network by setting up a node in a data center using ABS (Amazon Bitcoin Service), but you haven't done it yet. Spending $10 a month for ABS isn't bad, but that's half a coffee you could buy!\\n\\nYour devices:\\n\\nSome devices like your skin chip have just a few cents locked in a Lightning Network channel to help you do things like authenticate you when you enter just about any building these days. It makes a really small transaction every time you enter and leave the building and the Building Computer knows exactly who you are. It's still kinda weird to know that your location is tracked every second of every day, but you definitely don't miss having to talk to a receptionist to let the doctor know you have arrived for your age reversal appointment.\\n\\nOther devices, like your car, have about $10 loaded in a channel that is used for pay road tolls. Most roads cost about $0.00002 per meter. Auto-withdrawals is super easy to set up. When the channel drops below $1, your car communicates using the free Bitcoin SatNet (thanks Jeff Garzik for building this!) to replenish from your BitcoinX wallet anywhere in the world. You are excited because you just figured out a small shortcut on the way to visit your parents that saves about 100 meters. It only saves you a fraction of a cent, but it's fun to find little shortcuts like this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'comments': ['LOL - but you need to multiply the dollar prices by 10 or 100...\\n\\n> your Computer Home (the thing that replaced the home computer)...\\n\\nGlitters.']}, {'title': '/r/Bitcoin FAQ - Newcomers please read', 'subreddit': 'Bitcoin', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2plr21/rbitcoin_faq_newcomers_please_read/', 'selftext': '# Welcome To The /r/Bitcoin Sticky FAQ\\n\\nMaybe you\\'re here because you\\'ve received a tip on social media, or maybe you\\'ve just been hearing a lot recently about Bitcoin and are wondering what the big deal is?

Here are a couple useful sites [1](http://bitkoin.io/) and [2](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/) that shows how much various denominations of bitcoin are worth in different currencies. Alternatively you can just google \"1 bitcoin in (your local currency)\".\\n\\nYou can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (from as little as $1 worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank account.  Some recommendations include:\\n\\n**US & Europe** \\n\\n* [Circle.com](https://www.circle.com/en): [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.circle.android&hl=en) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/circle-for-bitcoin/id920164002?mt=8) (credit card or bank transfer) \\n* [Coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com/): [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinbase.android&hl=en) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinbase-bitcoin-wallet/id886427730?mt=8) (bank transfer)\\n* [Xapo.com](https://www.xapo.com/): [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xapo&hl=en) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xapo-bitcoin-wallet-vault/id917692892?mt=8) (SEPA, bank transfer)\\n* [SNAPCARD](https://www.snapcard.io) (credit card or bank transfer)\\n* [AnycoinDirect.eu](https://anycoindirect.eu/) (SEPA, Sofort, Giropay, iDEAL, Bancontact, Mybank, Online Bank Transfer)\\n* [BitQuick](https://www.bitquick.co/) (SEPA or cash)\\n* [CoinFloor](https://coinfloor.co.uk/)\\n* [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) \\n* [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) \\n* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) \\n* [Vault of Satoshi](https://www.vaultofsatoshi.com/)\\n* [BTC-E](https://btc-e.com/)\\n\\n\\n**Australia**\\n\\n* [Independent Reserve](https://www.independentreserve.com/)\\n* [btcmarkets.net](https://btcmarkets.net/)\\n* [CoinJar](https://www.coinjar.com/) (charges GST)\\n\\n**China**  \\n\\n* [OK Coin](https://www.okcoin.com/) \\n* [Huobi]( https://www.huobi.com/)\\n* [BTC China]( https://vip.btcchina.com/)\\n\\n**All countries**\\n\\n* [LocalBitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com/) (cash and other methods) (restrictions may apply in some countries)\\n* [Mycelium](http://mycelium.com/): [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mycelium-bitcoin-wallet/id943912290?mt=8) with [LocalTrader](http://mycelium.com/lt/help.html) (cash) (should be available in most countries) \\n* [HowToBuyBitcoins.info](http://howtobuybitcoins.info/)\\n* [Bitcoinx.io](http://bitcoinx.io/country-index) \\n* [Bitcoin ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/)\\n\\n**Always do your own personal due diligence on the validity of an exchange and check the URL prior to sending them money or entering login credentials.

UK residents can find a comprehensive directory of shops, pubs, websites and other places in the UK that accept bitcoins at [wheretospendbitcoins.co.uk](http://www.wheretospendbitcoins.co.uk).\\n\\nThere are also lots of charities which accept bitcoin donations, such as [Wikipedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Ways_to_Give#bitcoin), [Red Cross](https://bitpay.com/520663/donate) and the [RNLI](https://rnli.org/howtosupportus/donatenow/Pages/bitcoin.aspx). You can find a longer list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/targets#wiki_charities).\\n\\n## Merchant Resources\\n\\nIf you operate a business and want to accept bitcoin as a payment method, there are several options available:\\n\\n\\n* [BitPay](https://bitpay.com/bitcoin-for-retail)\\n* [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/merchants)\\n* [Coinkite](https://coinkite.com/faq/terminal)\\n* [SNAPCARD] (https://www.snapcard.io)\\n* [GoCoin](https://www.gocoin.com/)\\n\\n## Can I mine bitcoin?\\n\\nMining bitcoins can be a fun hobby but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The friendly folks at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. \\n\\nIf you want to contribute to the bitcoin network, you can run a full node by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions. [Here is a handy setup guide](https://medium.com/@lopp/how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-full-node-2dd1c09763d3)\\n\\n## Securing your bitcoins\\n\\nWith bitcoin you can be your own bank and personally secure your bitcoins or you can use trusted companies such as [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) and [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en) which have secured wallets where they hold the bitcoins for you and provide insurance.  Be sure to only deal with reputable companies, if you have any concerns about a company\\'s trustworthiness just ask or check their [consumer reviews and ratings](http://bitcoinx.io/). \\n\\nIf you prefer to have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party you can use personal wallets for desktops / laptops, Android and iOS where you alone hold your private keys. [Electrum](https://electrum.org/),  [Mycelium](http://mycelium.com/) and [Breadwallet](http://breadwallet.com/) are popular, but there are many options. \\n\\n[**Find a wallet that works best for you**](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet)\\n\\n**For increased security use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** (2FA requires a second confirmation code to access your account, usually from a text message or app, making it much harder for thieves to gain access).  Google Authenticator and Authy are two great apps for handling 2FA. \\n\\n* Google Authenticator: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8)\\n* Authy: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8)\\n\\nAdditional security systems such as [Mycelium Entropy](http://mycelium.com/entropy) (for printing [multi-signature](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/11848/multisig-explained/) paper wallets) and the [Trezor Hardware Wallet](http://www.bitcointrezor.com/) are great ways to easily secure your coins. Or, you can opt to secure your bitcoin using [cold storage](http://bitzuma.com/posts/a-gentle-introduction-to-bitcoin-cold-storage/). \\n\\n**Note:** Do not use brainwallets unless you are an expert, they are known to be vulnerable to theft unless set up correctly.  \\n\\n## Earning bitcoins\\n\\nJust like any other form of money, you can earn bitcoins by working for them. Here are a few resources for bitcoin jobs.\\n\\n* [/r/Jobs4Bitcoins](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins)\\n* [Coinality job board](https://coinality.com/)\\n* [Bitgigs job board](http://bitgigs.com/)\\n\\n## Tipping\\n\\n* Use [ChangeTip.com](https://www.changetip.com/) ([/r/changetip](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip)) for tipping people on Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr, GitHub and more! (you can even use [custom monikers](https://www.changetip.com/tip-amounts) to tailor your tip to the discussion or add a bit of humor). \\n* You can read more about ChangeTip at their reddit [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/index).\\n* Go to [/r/FreeBits](https://www.reddit.com/r/freebits) to get a few microbits to practice with and then tip them forward. Go to [/r/BitTippers](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitTippers) to play games and solve riddles to earn your bits. Don\\'t forget your flair!\\n \\n## Bitcoin Units\\n**Note:** This is a brief overview to the most commonly used Bitcoin units. For full information check out the [Bitcoin Units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units) (work in progress).\\n\\nOne Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of £/$/€) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common ones are listed below:\\n\\nUnit | Symbol | Value | Info\\n---|:---:|---|---\\nmillibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for milli i.e. millilitre (ml) or millimeter (mm)\\nmicrobitcoin | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for micro i.e microlitre (μl) or micrometre (μm)\\nsatoshi |sat| 100,000,000 per bitcoin| Smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor\\n\\nFor example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $500 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:\\n\\n* 0.02 BTC\\n* 20 mBTC\\n* 20,000 μBTC (colloquially referred to as bits)\\n\\n---\\n\\nStill have questions?

To be included on our website the Bitcoin exchange must allow users to buy and/or sell bitcoins using fiat currency. We are only interested in exchanges that provide a gateway into bitcoin through traditional means, and not coin-to-coin exchanges or swaps.\\n\\nAfter a review, we see that Mineral is not an exchange gateway that accepts fiat deposits and/or withdrawals. Due to this, we won't be including them on our service for ratings and reviews. However, through our review we wanted to also share to those that don't know - Mineral is using the former [Coin-Swap exchange](https://coin-swap.net/) code base - basically, Mineral is a clone of sorts, a re-branding of Coin-Swap to benefit Garza (obviously). \\n\\nCoin-Swap saw some success as a coin-to-coin exchange, but was recently acquired by Garza, which is now getting turned into Mineral. To further confirm this, we found [this post](https://hashtalk.org/topic/35591/my-involvement-with-mineral/5) ([archived](https://archive.today/P8PKB)) by Garza where he clearly states that GAW is utelizing Coin-Swap base code to power Mineral. \\n\\nGiven GAW/Garza's past issues, this may end up being another dramatic endeavor for the cryptospace.

People should keep in mind not a single GAW product has lasted more than a few months, and on most people have had issues with coins not showing up, odd accounting, and coins being \"locked\" on the platform (withdrawals not working).', 'Appreciate the depth post!
