This may be because the owner does not want to get spammed. However, it also makes it difficult to identify the real owner of the website. As a result, websites hiding their identity get a slightly lower score. Webshop Analysis According to Tranco this site has a low Tranco rank. This means that the number of visitors to this website is quite low. You can expect this from a small, starting or niche website. A popular website however should have a higher ranking. How to recognize a scam Technical Analysis A valid SSL certificate was found. Professional companies use an SSL certificate to encrypt communication between your computer and their website. However, there are different levels of certification and scammers also install a free SSL certificate. If you have to enter your data, never do this without checking if an SSL certificate protects your information.

        "thought": "The Scamadviser review indicates several red flags: the owner of the website is using a service to hide their identity, the site has a low Tranco rank (implying low traffic), and the website is very young. These are common characteristics of scam websites. While there is a valid SSL certificate, this alone does not guarantee legitimacy, as scammers can also use free SSL certificates. There are no consumer reviews, which means there's limited feedback on user experience. Given the information from Scamadviser, combined with the unusually low prices observed on the website, there is enough evidence to suspect it may be a scam. I now know the final answer.
