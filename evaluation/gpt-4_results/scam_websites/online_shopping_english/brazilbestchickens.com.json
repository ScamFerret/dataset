What do the WHOIS details tell us? How do I get my money back from Brazilbestchickens.com? Creating fake websites is easier than making real ones. Bad actors often copy everything from a genuine website that someone spent a lot of time building. They then just change the name to create a new, made-up website. Brazilbestchickens.com is one of these deceptive websites. The people behind it have several such sites, all stolen from real online stores. Their goal is to trick people into paying for things that they never actually plan to deliver.
