I’m simply a guy who had a bunch of free time on his hands last year and wanted to explore what this city had to offer in terms of clothes. If I post this and you still see me typing, it’s because I wanted to get the most important places to come to mind out there first for recommendation. I don’t work for any boutiques and don’t know anyone who runs them apart from saying hello after frequent visits, so any bias that you may read in my written tone is purely based on my personal tastes.\\n\\nI’m going to briefly mention Holt Renfrew in Pacific Centre before I get started, as I do recommend visiting it for the department store experience.\\n\\nMost of this is from a menswear perspective, so if you have any store recommendations that I missed, please email me at the email I used to create this document, and I’ll either give them a brief write-up, or visit them, because I probably haven’t yet! Please also read the edits, as there are some exciting new places that I\\'ve been checking out that make me not only excited by the people here who are coming out of the woodwork to discuss fashion, but also excited for the Vancouver creative space as a whole!\\n\\n# Designer Boutiques:\\n\\n**Roden Gray (Gastown, Richmond Center):**\\n\\nMenswear store dedicated to various facets of contemporary designer fashion. Effective jack-of-all-trades type of store where you’re bound to find an effective curated selection that represents the best in streetwear, techwear, and avant-garde.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** A-COLD-WALL\\\\*, Aime Leon Dore, Canada Goose, Comme des Garcons (Shirt and Homme Plus), Craig Green, Dries Van Noten, ERL, Fear of God, Fumito Ganryu, Gentle Monster, Homme Plisse Issey Miyake, Jil Sander, John Elliott, Marni, Martine Rose, Readymade, Sacai, Saint Michael, Song for the Mute\\n\\nWebsite: [https://rodengray.com/](https://rodengray.com/)\\n\\n**Neighbour (Gastown):**\\n\\nTons of Scandi and Scandi-inspired minimalism and elevated basics brands. If you’re looking for like, well-made earth tone colourways that make you look like a rich author, you go here. Three different locations across Gastown, with the largest dealing with menswear in particular and the other two tackling womenswear and homewear.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Bode, Acne Studios, Our Legacy, Needles, Orslow, Camiel Fortgens, Evan Kinori, Engineered Garments, Auralee\\n\\nWebsite: [https://www.shopneighbour.com/](https://www.shopneighbour.com/)\\n\\n**Wallace Mercantile (Main Street):**\\n\\nKinda interesting because it’s like the same thing as Neighbour but with different brands. If I had to make a mention of anything that particular makes them stick out, it is their focus on diversity of semi-formal and hiking footwear.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Schnayderman’s, Andersson Bell, Knickerbocker, Solovair, Merrell, Hoka, Kleman\\n\\nWebsite: [https://wallacemercantileshop.com/#](https://wallacemercantileshop.com/#)\\n\\n**HAVEN (Gastown):**\\n\\nThis is the store I think of when it comes to Vancouver’s primary tastes in fashion. A blend of high-end gorpier garms with a mixing in of pretty iconic Japanese brands. Olives, browns, greys, and blacks abound.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** ACRONYM, Stone Island, Needles, Kapital, Cav Empt, Human Made, Visvim, Undercover, New Balance, Nike, HAVEN’s own in-house brand\\n\\nWebsite: [https://havenshop.com/](https://havenshop.com/)\\n\\n**Feuille Luxury (Downtown):**\\n\\nMenswear store that offers brands that show off the weirder side of contemporary streetwear. Many pieces are flashy, branded, or from extremely hyped brands. If you’re a person who doesn’t mind seeing Rick styled with Off-White, you may find a piece or two to add to the collection.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Ambush, Billionaire Boys Club, C2H4, Canada Goose, Casablanca, Chrome Hearts, Heron Preston, Juun.J, Kenzo, KidSuper, Moschino, Off-White, Palm Angels, Rhude, Rick Owens (Mainline and DRKSHDW)\\n\\nWebsite: [https://www.feuilleshop.com/](https://www.feuilleshop.com/)\\n\\n**/017 Shop (Downtown):**\\n\\nA few doors down from Feuille is /017 Shop, which is maybe the wildest selection in terms of clothing in the city. Many brands are uniquely sold by /017 in the city and often utilize flashy graphics or extremely unconventional silhouettes to demonstrate the forefront of exciting maximalist European and Asian fashion.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** 99% IS, C2H4, Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, Doublet, Études, Feng Chen Wang, Heliot Emil, Helmut Lang, Hyein Seo, KIDILL, Maison Mihara Yasuhiro, MISBHV, Post Archive Faction, Y/Project\\n\\nWebsite: [https://www.feuilleshop.com/](https://www.feuilleshop.com/)\\n\\n**Leisure Center (Yaletown):**\\n\\nIf you want fashion to feel like an exercise in either artistic presentation or being part of an exclusive club, Leisure Center is the place to go. This place does not fuck around with their presentation, making everything pristine, clean, and labyrinthine to maintain the essence of the store as an artistic space. I definitely recommend namedropping brand knowledge if you feel you’re getting judged. A blend of high-profile designer pieces as well as truly avant-garde brands you won’t find anywhere else in the city.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Ambush, Amiri, Ann Demeulemeester, Balenciaga, Balmain, Devoa, Elena Dawson, ERL, Gentle Monster, Guidi, Geoffrey B. Small, Lemaire, Loewe, m.a+, Maison Margiela (mainline and MM6), Marc Le Bihan, Marine Serre, mastermind (JAPAN and WORLD), Palm Angels, Song for the Mute, Uma Wang, Yohji Yamamoto, Ziggy Chen\\n\\nWebsite: [https://leisure-center.com/](https://leisure-center.com/)\\n\\n**KOKKO Luxury Boutique (Aberdeen Center)**\\n\\nActs as an outlet for Leisure Center, essentially has very discounted prices on out-of-season pieces initially sold by LC.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** See above.\\n\\nWebsite: [https://www.kokko.me/](https://www.kokko.me/)\\n\\n**Plus (Pacific Centre), Stay Fresh (Richmond Centre, Metrotown), 8PM Shop (Downtown, Aberdeen Center), Heat Vault/NFS (Gastown):**\\n\\nJordans, Dunks, Supreme, Yeezys. Has it been hyped in the past 5 years? It’s there. Is it in your size? Of course not. Is it priced fair? What even is fair in the current resale market?! If you are looking to get anything that a true blue hypebeast desires, go to any of these stores and you’ll be satisfied. I will give a special shoutout mention to 8PM Shop though, for generally having a wider array of desirable items, like a pretty decent selection of Supreme goods, XVessel sneakers, and managing to be the only place I’ve seen in Vancouver with the mythical Red Octobers at one point. NFS has also surprised me with items like Evisu jackets and rare collab pieces.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Nike, Jordan Brand, Yeezy, Supreme, Fear of God Essentials\\n\\n**Blim (Chinatown):**\\n\\nDo you like popular culture and anime? Of course you do, you are between 13 and 30 years old and reading this post! A store dedicated to custom screenprints and buttons to really tap into that contemporary version of scene/goth stuff. Their dedication to this flashy aesthetic makes them an ascended Hot Topic in the best possible way. In addition, the owners have started sourcing vintage pieces from Japan, making them technically a vintage store like no other in the city.\\n\\nWebsite: [https://blim.ca/](https://blim.ca/)\\n\\n**Private and Co. (Chinatown):**\\n\\nI find this store really interesting and fun. A blend of raw denim enthusiast-core, with streetwear-oriented vintage resale, then a sneaker/video game resale section at the back. It’s like all of the interests a man can have in fashion in this city if we didn’t have hiking as our local pastime.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Momotaro, Japan Blue, Left Field\\n\\nWebsite: [https://privatestock.ca/](https://privatestock.ca/)\\n\\n**The Shop (Chinatown):**\\n\\nIf you want the rawest denim and leathers you can find in Vancouver, come here. Extremely high pricepoints for extremely well-made garments that will be sure to get you some Gold certifications and upvotes on /r/MFA. Opening and closing times are weird though, I think I’ve only seen this store open once when walking past it.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Iron Heart, Schott, TCB, Wesco, Y-2 Leather\\n\\nWebsite: [https://theshopvancouver.com/](https://theshopvancouver.com/)\\n\\n**Gravitypope (Gastown (footwear only), Kitsilano):**\\n\\nOne in every Canadian city, elevated basics and footwear boutique.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Beams Plus, Arc’teryx, Acne Studios, Church’s, Camper, Ami, A.P.C., Nike, New Balance, Adidas, Blue Blue Japan,\\n\\nWebsite: [https://www.gravitypope.com/](https://www.gravitypope.com/)\\n\\n**Livestock (Chinatown):**\\n\\nAuthor’s favourite “sneaker boutique” in the city due to carrying some neat brands.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Brain Dead, Parra, Carhartt WIP, Nike, Adidas, New Balance, Yeezy, ASICS, CDG Homme, Awake NY, Salomon, Dr. Martens, Hoka, And Wander\\n\\nWebsite: [https://www.deadstock.ca/](https://www.deadstock.ca/)\\n\\n**Size? (Robson Street):**\\n\\nSneaker boutique.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Nike, Jordan Brand, Adidas, Yeezy, New Balance, ASICS, Salomon, Gramicci, Fred Perry, Carhartt WIP, HUF, MARKET, The North Face, Pleasures\\n\\nWebsite: [https://size.ca/](https://size.ca/)\\n\\n**Corner Shop Vancouver (Main Street):**\\n\\nSneaker boutique. Extension of Complex Clothing in Victoria.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Nike, Jordan Brand, Adidas, New Balance, Stussy, Pleasures\\n\\nWebsite: [https://complexonline.com/#](https://complexonline.com/#)\\n\\n**Dipt City Kicks (Downtown):**\\n\\nSneaker boutique. Lotsa Grizzlies merch and Vancouver-inspired apparel, as well as a decent number of sneaker books.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Nike, Jordan Brand, New Balance\\n\\nWebsite: [https://www.vancityoriginal.com/new-dipt-kicks/](https://www.vancityoriginal.com/new-dipt-kicks/)\\n\\n**CNTRBND (Gastown)**\\n\\nHigh fashion/sneaker boutique that is slowly trickling in product from their more established Toronto location. Across the street from Neighbour Men and Roden Gray.\\n\\n**Notable brands (currently):** Nike, Jordan Brand, Suicoke, Just Don, 424, Advisory Board Crystals, Raf Simons, Ami, Emotionally Unavailable, Jacquemus\\n\\nWebsite: [https://www.cntrbndshop.com/](https://www.cntrbndshop.com/)\\n\\n**The Block (Gastown)**\\n\\nAnother elevated basics place but with some kooky womenswear thrown in for some zest.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** A.P.C., Filippa K, Henrik Vibskov, Universal Works\\n\\nWebsite: [https://theblock.ca/](https://theblock.ca/)\\n\\n**Bacci’s (Granville):**\\n\\nWomenswear and homeware store which feels like an effective counterpart to Roden Gray.\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Dries van Noten, J.W. Anderson, Jacquemus, Marni, Simone Rocha, Yohji Yamamoto (Y’s and Y-3)\\n\\nWebsite: [https://www.baccisvancouver.com/](https://www.baccisvancouver.com/)\\n\\n**Granville Island Hat Shop (Granville Island):**\\n\\nIt’s a hat store! It’s got hats! Real nice ones! I don’t know much about hats!\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Goorin Bros., Kangol (probably more on the website, but I really really don’t know about hats like that)\\n\\nWebsite: [https://www.thehatshop.ca/](https://www.thehatshop.ca/)\\n\\n**Dutil**\\n\\nRaw denim place that’s great for entry-level denimheads. Lots of Naked and Famous and Nudie and apparently they do some repairs there too?\\n\\n**Notable brands:** Naked and Famous, Nudie Jeans, Iron Heart, Tiger of Sweden, Pure Blue Japan\\n\\nWebsite: [https://dutildenim.com/](https://dutildenim.com/)\\n\\n# Vintage Shops:\\n\\nDistinguishing between vintage stores in terms of what they generally offer is kind of a hard thing to tackle. So what I’ll do is have a legend for if I find them to be more general (^(1)), streetwear-oriented (^(2)) or designer resale-based (^(3)).\\n\\n**Mintage Mall (Main Street, Commercial Drive, and Robson Street)** **^(1)**\\n\\n**Kool Thing Vintage (Chinatown)** **^(1)**\\n\\n**F as in Frank/Rag Machine (Main Street)** **^(1-2)**\\n\\n**Stoxx Vintage (Kingsgate Mall)** **^(2)**\\n\\n**Rewind Resale (Main Street, White Rock)** **^(1-3)**\\n\\n**Turnabout Resale (Main Street, Commercial Drive, Kitsilano)** **^(1-3)**\\n\\n**Front & Company (Main Street)** **^(1)**\\n\\n**Gore St. Vintage (Chinatown)** **^(2)**\\n\\n**Burcu’s Angels (Main Street)** **^(1)**\\n\\n**Bohemia Gallery (Main Street)** **^(1)**\\n\\n**The Value Village by Richmond Centre (Richmond)** **^(1)**\\n\\n**High End Resale (Downtown Core, Aberdeen Centre)** **^(3)**\\n\\n**Mine & Yours (Downtown Core, Yaletown)** **^(3)**\\n\\n**Ollie\\'s (Commercial Drive)** **^(2)**\\n\\n**Woo Vintage Clothing (Main Street)** **^(1)**\\n\\n**Lines Vintage (Main Street)** **^(1)**\\n\\n**Little Miss Vintage (Commercial Drive)** **^(1)**\\n\\n**Forestera Vintage (East Hastings)** **^(1)**\\n\\n**Erin Templeton (Chinatown)** **^(1)**\\n\\n**Vancouver Vintage Market (Commercial Drive) (only open on weekends)** **^(1-2)**\\n\\nEDIT 1: I have now gone to **KAMUY (Hastings)** and highly recommend it! Extremely well-curated vintage that appeals to all aesthetics that are in the current fashion zeitgeist. Extremely hard to find on first visit so be sure to message their IG @kamuyvintage.\\n\\nEDIT 1.1: **KAMUY (Gastown)** has moved to near Le Magasin at the opening of Gastown. **tthhaannkkss** is still running out of the previous location on Cordova and Carrall. KAMUY is more so oriented towards the vintage hunting wear, military wear, and workwear, while tthhaannkkss has vintage designer more in line with ravewear or streetwear.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Thank you so much for all the compliments and accolades! I love fashion and meeting people in this city who are into it, so if you\\'re interested in meeting up one day at an event or something, my IG is @gesamtkunstwerkinprogress. Have a great day!\\n\\nEDIT 3: Went to **Alterior/A Living Taste (Commercial Drive)** based on a recommendation (thank you Brennan from Livestock!), also extremely worthwhile. Well-curated nu-streetwear, menswear, and homewares store that I\\'d recommend for fans of Brain Dead, as it has that similar lineup of ideas from both \"high\" and \"low cultures\" ranging from handcrafted raw denim to extremely elevated graphic tees. The store also acts as the factory for their in-house brand, so you get a true intimate sense of who the staff are, their passions for fashion practices, and what their vision is going forward. Their website is here: https://alterior.ca/', 'comments': ['As a Vancouver local in my late 30’s looking to upgrade my wardrobe, this is incredibly helpful!
