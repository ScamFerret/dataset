Click the link below to download the free ScamAdviser Browser Extension. Download Now Complete Review Company Evaluation The owner of the website is hiding his identity. Spammers use this information to promote services to website owners. Some website owners therefor chose to hide their contact details. However, it can also be misused by scammers. Our algorithm gives a high rating if the identity of the website owner is shown. Webshop Evaluation In our Analysis we always check the Tranco ranking. In this case it was low. A low Tranco ranking means that the website has relatively few visitors. For a new website this is logical. The same is true for a highly specialized website. However if the website claims to be a large corporate or popular site, than warning flags should be raised. Technical Evaluation We found a valid SSL Certificate. An SSL certificate is used to secure communication between your computer and the website. There are different levels of SSL certification. A free one is also available and this one is used by online scammers. Still, not having an SSL certificate is worse than having one, especially if you have to enter your contact details.
