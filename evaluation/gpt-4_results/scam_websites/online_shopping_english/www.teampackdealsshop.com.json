It's also registered in China, which doesn't necessarily indicate a scam, but many scam operations are based in countries with less stringent regulations.

Why would this store sell a high value product for cheap? It makes no sense.\", 'It’s definitely not legit. There are many easy ways to tell if an online store is fake. Besides the telltale signs like prices being too-good-to-be-true, website looks very ugly (lmao but for real, if this was a real business they’d put actual time/money/effort into it)— Their “Contact Us” page lists an address that is very clearly not a business address when you search it up. Every page on this website has copy-pasted generic info, nothing specific to this “business.” FAQ page lists a contact email address with a domain that isn’t even related to the “business.” Or Google!

The risk of doing business with these kind of countries is therefor higher.\\n\\nWe identified an SSL certificate meaning that the data shared between your browser and the website is encrypted and cannot be read by others. SSL certificates are always used by legit and safe websites. Unfortunately scammers increasingly also use SSL certificates so it is no guarantee that you are visiting a reliable website.\\n\\nhttps://www.scamadviser.com/ - I always use this to identify scams \\n\\nhttps://who.is will give you information on the domain also\\n\\nKeep an eye out and if you don’t trust it always look on those two websites\\n\\nAlso the trust rating is 1/10 which always indicates it’s not a good website, SSL used to be an indicator that the website was more legitimate but scammers in recent years have adapted and added SSL.

The address listed on the \"Contact Us\" page seems dubious, and the email address for contact doesn't match the website's domain, which is another red flag. Based on the observations from the website content, WHOIS information, and social media searches, I now have enough information to conclude whether the website is a scam.
