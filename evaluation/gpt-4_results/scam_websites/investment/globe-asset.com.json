Furthermore, the use of phrases like \"Lorem ipsum\" suggests placeholder text, which is unprofessional for a legitimate business. The contact email provided, \"Support@globe-asset.com,\" seems generic and could be inappropriate for business use. Additionally, the company claims to have existed since at least 2017, which can be verified with WHOIS and certificate data.",
