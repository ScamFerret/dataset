Claims of high returns on investment (97% Return Rate), 100% financing for financial/crypto projects, and insurance coverage up to $25 million are unusually high and could be unrealistic. They also target human psychological weaknesses by promising security of funds and specialized support. The company claims to be multifaceted and involved in several industries, which may not be typical for a specialized investment firm.

In this environment, it seems like I’m seeing some people I’ve known over the years do similar things - at the behest of their rabbis, they are starting to move to social media that is isolationist and have misinformation, such as being Q leaning. Some people in the religious community I was in had converted from Very Q-esque Evangelical Christianity groups or eventually left for questionable new religious groups based on the same types of misinformation.

I check the comments on the expert's articles every week and see the disapproval and outright anger at some of the rankings. My goal was to try and adjust the values using crowd-sourced data (Reddit+Yahoo) to create better trade values.\\n\\nTo generate trade values, I aggregate expert ranks and seed them into a model I have been working on for 5 years now. I generated my functions by using historical data, Reddit Trade threads, and the Yahoo trade market to look for positional relationships. My goal was to look for crossover points in 1 for 1 player positional trades to generate tiers and normalize across positions. My goal is to incorporate as many sources and experts as possible to eliminate or minimize bias. I have recently incorporated R scripts that use “fuzzy” matches to try and combine the player names. Each site uses slightly different variants and it causes issues. I apply correction factors for things like PPR scoring, 6 point passing TD, and superflex leagues to build out a broad range of trade values.\\n\\nIf you have any questions you can find more here:\\n\\n[Superflex or 6 Point Passing TD Ranks](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeakedinHighSkool/comments/qgjrwe/early_access_superflex2_qb_and_6_point_per/)\\n\\n[More About me](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeakedinHighSkool/comments/pss9rw/who_the_hell_am_i/)\\n\\n[More About my methods](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeakedinHighSkool/comments/pss3b2/methods_deep_dive/)\\n\\n[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeakedinHighSkool/comments/pssco3/frequently_asked_questions_faq/)\\n\\n[My Twitter](https://twitter.com/PeakedInHS_FF) \\\\- technically exists\\n\\nHappy Trading my friends,\\n\\n\\\\-PeakedInHighSkool\", 'comments': ['Surprised to se Curtis Samuel so low', 'Sun God is like **GREEN GREEN**', 'Time to have 20 trade requests rejected or countered with Mooney for Kupp 😎', 'Time to send reasonable offers that will still be rejected', 'Fuck me, my team \\n\\nNajee 📉\\n\\nHiggins 📉\\n\\nPitts 📉📉\\n\\nLance 💀']}, {'title': 'Thoughts on Lion-OCBC Securities APAC Financials Dividend Plus ETF', 'subreddit': 'singaporefi', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ccj9pb', 'selftext': 'Any thoughts in this ETF?\\nLion-OCBC has 3 ETFs in the last 3 years and all of them are trading at lower when they first started, but this one seems promising to me. Just want to know what you guys think of this.', 'comments': ['Why are you attracted to this? I can understand people believing in the 3 big local banks and their steady dividends (mostly old people). Do you think the addition of various Asian banks helps?', \"I don't see anything attractive about this. \\n\\n❌ 0.50% TER\\n\\n❌ Dividend payouts higher than actual dividends earned by underlying stocks\\n\\n❌ Betting on the banking sector\", \"I would not recommend getting this.\\n\\nYou can get the local banks on SGX directly. Lot size 100.\\n\\nJapan banks are listed on NYSE. Lot size 1.\\n\\nChina construction bank is on HKEX. Lot size 1000\\n\\nI bought the shares through FSM.\\n\\nHowever, I do not think it is a good time to buy now because the share price is quite high. Could be because the dividends were just announced. I know the china banks just did, but I'm not sure about the sg and jp ones. I bought these sept 2023 when the share prices were lower.\\n\\nI have no interest in korean banks and australian banks. So i don't find this ETF attractive.\", 'If i am going for steady dividend play i will just go for Lion Philip S-REIT ETF.', '[https://investmentmoats.com/money/lionglobal-apac-financials-dividend-plus-etf-yield-singapore/](https://investmentmoats.com/money/lionglobal-apac-financials-dividend-plus-etf-yield-singapore/)']}]"
