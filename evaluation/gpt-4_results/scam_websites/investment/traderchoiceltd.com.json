        "thought": "The extracted text shows several red flags that are typical of scam websites: 1. Offers of high returns with phrases like \"8.00% Interest AFTER 12 HOURS\" and \"35.00% Interest Daily\" which seem unrealistic and too good to be true. 2. An emphasis on anonymity and quick withdrawals, which can be appealing to people looking to get fast returns without a trace. 3. The claim of being a \"Legally Registered in UK with company number NO#:SC570428\" which should be verified for authenticity. 4. The website mentions a physical address and a certificate, but these could be fabricated to gain trust. Next, I should verify the legitimacy of their business claims and registration.",
