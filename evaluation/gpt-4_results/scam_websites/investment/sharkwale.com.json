The website promises unusually high returns on investment, offering \"Weekly 10%\" and other high-yield investment plans. 2. It targets human psychological weaknesses by promising easy money through investment plans and referral systems. 3. The website claims to be associated with \"the world's leading digital asset trading platforms\" without providing substantial evidence or details about these associations. 4. The section on withdrawing money is vague, mentioning the need to \"follow our procedures\" and an \"understanding between Sharkwale and customers,\" which may indicate ambiguous customer information privacy. 5. The payment method includes an \"automatic gateway\" but lacks details, which could be considered unusual.",
