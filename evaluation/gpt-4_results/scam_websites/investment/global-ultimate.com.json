Just watch The Good Place on Netflix. It’s exactly what you’re talking about. They’re already putting it our faces', 'WOW. I wish I had someone IRL to talk about this stuff. Before I comment, let me just say that I don\\'t pretend to be any kind of official expert in this stuff, I just know my own experiences and my comments are based primarily from MY experiences, not books or videos or any of that. Sorry for the length\\n\\nOk begin comment. From a really young age I have been able to have astral awareness and able to expand my consciousness to higher planes above astral. As a kid I had struggled a lot on lower astral until I realized around the age of 10 (I\\'m 50 now) that the things i was seeing in lower astral were feeding off my negative energy. After learning that and then learning to control my emotions I made it out of lower astral. For the next 15 years, I just did a lot of idling around astral with no real aim, but  10 years after that, I found an online forum devoted to spirituality and at the time I had A LOT of free time on my hand  so  I ended up doing more astral travel. i decided to get serious about it and was meditating. I soon started meeting guides, ascendant masters and all that. \\n\\nAfter awhile, most of the experiences started to feel like wild goose chases/easter egg hunts. It was never a straight answer or if I did get an answer it was multiple questions. Plus I was getting like dozens of \"guides\" each one acting as if they had something to teach me but it was always like those stupid articles where you gotta click page after page after page to get to whatever the headline was about and i never got to the headline. This went on for about 10 years. By this time I knew something wasn\\'t right but I didn\\'t know what. \\n\\nDuring those 10 years I would get really frustrated with my \"guides\" and would fire them individually and then a new would appear but eventually the same jumping through hoops would occur and then I\\'d fire them, etc. Eventually I got the idea - I don\\'t even know from where to be honest - to revoke contracts. So I decided to try thinking nothing of it. I can\\'t remember exactly how I worded it but I know I mentioned revoking any contract with any being who didn\\'t have my highest good in mind. Almost immediately after that my experiences stopped. I\\'m not saying that astral plane depopulated, but no more guides or ascended masters or any of that. I thought \"hmmm that\\'s interesting.\" \\n\\nAlmost soon after that I had another experience where I was pulled from astral. This was weird because by this time, I  was completely in control of my astral body, but I didn\\'t freak out because I\\'m kind of bad ass on astral  and I figured OK let\\'s see where I go. So from what I could see I was pulled out to the stars (first time that\\'s happened) then past the stars and eventually I got to someplace that was completely dark like a big void. I felt myself being pulled so I was like \\'where tf am I going? what\\'s after a void?\\' then I finally came to this place that was super high energetically. I felt like I was being shielded, but I also felt piece of ice in a cup of hot tea. Some being there essentially said hi and quickly shot me back to astral plane. Since then I\\'ve been doing some digging on my own during my journeys.  Here\\'s what I have discovered so far, i think - these are in no particular order\\n\\n1. Matter is created from spirit\\n2. We all come from a singular divine energy. This is pretty much the same as the gnostic concept. I don\\'t have too much info on this but from what I\\'ve seen and experienced, the gnostic views seem correct, especially the cathars\\n3. This entire multiverse including physical plane, astral, other spiritual realms is part of a bigger system that you can think of as breathing. Think of breathing, it\\'s a 2-fold process of in breath and out breath. \\n4. The god of this world/chief archon/however you want to name it is also just another part of the divine energy but is at point where they have been, for lack of a better word, corrupted by all the delicious varieties of energy it has access to. \\n5. I believe loosh only accounts for negative energy, but this being will also take positive energy as well ie worship, praise, love, devotion, attention, etc\\n6. Back to what I was saying about the multiverse being a breathing system, the chief archon is somehow blocking the in breath from happening. So the outbreath is happening but the in breath is getting cut off = > reincarnation trap. This is also why there are increasingly more souls. \\n7. Chief archon is helping this to occur ultimately because IT does not want to go back home, but it knows deep down that eventually it will have to. \\n8. Don\\'t despair, if you want out there are ways. The easiest way is to remember to make the choice to not be swayed by physical plane. So many people get pulled back in by thinking of their family, friends, wanting revenge, wanting remorse, etc. That stuff ties you to reincarnate because of desire. \\n9. the way to prepare yourself for death - if you want to not reincarnate - is to start getting in touch with your spiritual self now. Learn to navigate astral plane, but beware astral is also just a glamor same as physical plane. So don\\'t get too attached to anything there either\\n\\nOk that\\'s it for now. I now primarily work on astral as a psychopomp, helping people make people with their earthly issues but ultimately the choice to reincarnate is their\\'s. I have also learned that I chose to continue reincarnating to help make sure all you f\\\\*ckers make it back home  LOL. Seriously though, I am in this for the long haul and since I have revoked my soul contracts I have been made offers by the chief archon, which is kind of sad in a way. I have seen something like factories where angels are made. Also be careful of anything that is supposed to be a higher level being but who\\'s on astral, more than likely it\\'s not what it\\'s supposed to be.\\n\\nThanks for reading!!', 'How can we escape??

And though they are and must be public\\xa0figures at times, they remain modest as best possible. Mods know they are not \"other than\", they are Apes first, Mods second.  It\\'s a core value and shared ideal of all Mods.

A Community like no other.  It is veritable and virtual city of Athens - where Ideas reign and Ideals bond.

Simply put: We just like the stock, and each other.  These foundational Ideas and Ideals give this Community its unique strength. And they are the result of the promise of seeds planted in those early days, having now matured into this shrewdness of evolved, global, and diverse Apes. **You**. \\xa0\\n\\nI helped recruit and build this Mod team, and I am comfortable stepping back in part because I know that those at this sub\\'s helm -\\xa0u/pinkcatsonacid, u/bye_triangle, u/redchessqueen99 and u/rensole,\\xa0and every moderator -\\xa0have the True North of Valhalla in their sights and Apes’ best interests in their hearts.\\xa0 With this truly world class team, Apes are well served and protected.\\n\\n[ Hang a right at the second shitpost - and head straight on \\'til morning.](https://preview.redd.it/ld4u1nzs7h471.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=633d2f8c8a567efe66d3065181cb1c911b1bc25d)\\n\\n# Two Steps Forward: First, into the Light\\n\\nStepping back from my Mod role was not an easy decision to make, but it was the right one for me ... so that I can take two steps forward.\\xa0 First into the light, and then into the fight.

I have a very particular set of skills ...](https://preview.redd.it/svbnqi108h471.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=edce389b53b6c151a1bff14d85e94c67a14ddc87)\\n\\n# Never Forget Where You Come From\\n\\nFirst, and above all, I am a husband and father to three brilliant little girls, and I care deeply about my family\\'s future.  My values were shaped by my parents, two NYC public school teachers, and through their\\xa0experiences and eyes I long witnessed the inequities of the educational system.  My grandparents were immigrants, short-haul truck drivers, and struggling business owners.  They toiled within debt systems that doomed them to a life of indentured poverty.  I know that I am fortunate, because of their struggle and sacrifice I had a precious and rare opportunity to reach up and grab - to seize - the American Dream. And I did not waste my chance.\\xa0 Diamond Fucking Hands.\\n\\nMy path to professional success was not paved by connections or wealth, but built upon a deep and foundational reservoir of focus, industriousness and creativity.  My path went from from community college to the Ivy League.  From staff to professional.  From follower to founder.  Along the way I have been a Humanitarian - delivering food and medicine in Belarus to child victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident.  I have been a high school biology Teacher in the Bronx - witnessing the inequities of education first hand.  I have been a Lawyer at a top global firm, first as a peon underlying and then - through sheer force of will - winning a seat at tables of influence no young professional can imagine, nor expect.  And - now - I have been a SuperStonk Mod, during an unprecedented global Intellectual Rebellion.\\n\\n[The Power of APEs. The Power of People.](https://preview.redd.it/i70w63znih471.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=a62d2a03639b6689ccea5cce42b9c02bd379a03e)\\n\\nAt the peak of my legal career I left.  I recognized that I had lost sight of my humanitarian values and my charitable roots but, thankfully, not my memory of them.  So I cast off from the calm and comfort of being a working professional and entered the choppy and uncharted waters of social entrepreneurship.  I wanted to build the world I hoped for my daughters.  I wanted to align my passion and purpose.  So - with much work - I did.\\n\\nShortly after I left the law I founded a tech startup named TwentyTables. TwentyTables’ mission was to tackle food insecurity head on, by designing new, tech-enabled, synergistic, vertically integrated systems that could provide low-cost high-quality meals *en mas*.\\xa0\\xa0TwentyTables provided affordable food to those who often couldn’t access it, and donated meals to those who couldn’t afford it.\\xa0\\xa0Over the ensuing 4 years, TwentyTables employed 20 amazing people, served hundreds of thousands of meals, and helped feed tens of thousands of hungry and homeless.  All bootstrapped without corporate funding.\\n\\n[ Just take a moment to ponder the fantastical implications.](https://preview.redd.it/zgcs7dh28h471.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d16d1ac1c6b20ace2fa46b5bc66531f4f855c9c)\\n\\nTwentyTables succeeded by building systems predicated on aligned incentives and by embedding structural dynamics where all prospered together. [\\\\*Somewhat like Dr. T\\'s - unique - audiobook contract. Shout out to u/pinkcatsonacid!!\\\\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n71vy9/apes_change_the_world_superstonk_is_donating_time/) From investor, to food distributor, to vendor, to paying customer, to charity, to food insecure family, Everyones\\' incentives were aligned to make the system pull in the same direction.  TwentyTables was a tech enabled business whose foundations comprised complementary aims and goals, not ones based on predatory practices.  THIS is the way.  This is how you make difficult - systemic - change REAL.  And it works.\\xa0\\n\\nAlong the way, TwentyTables received national awards and recognition for our work, but I more often think about the people I met, the smiles I shared, and the bellies we filled.\\xa0 I know we had a real and lasting impact.  And with TwentyTables I learned just how powerful an Idea aligning profit and purpose was - truly capitalism in its best form.\\xa0 And I learned that the Idea resonated at local food banks,\\xa0and in ivy halls.\\xa0 The Idea of aligned Prosperity was Universal, and Powerful.\\n\\n[US Chamber of Commerce Foundation Citizen Awards: Best Corporate Steward \\\\(Sm\\\\/Md\\\\) \\\\(2020\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xoa7zygv8h471.jpg?width=2771&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cafc1c6303a928141a3a001acb277c3f95c72881)\\n\\nBut then, COVID hit and ... like so many other growing businesses ... COVID killed my company, scattered my employees, and faded the once shining - perhaps grandiose - vision I had of building a better, more efficient, more equitable food system. And gone was the vision for a better world I was building for my little girls.\\xa0 COVID ultimately took not only my company, but for many months it took away my purpose.  The good I had dedicated my life to bringing into this world was gone.

Superstonk was made a couple weeks before the migration. It was 270 people before when I left r/GME on April 4. Stonk hit me up shortly after and said he had created r/MOASS just a few days prior due to the massive bans at r/GME. He offered to redirect its roughly 10k followers to r/Superstonk just as u/rensole brought in u/HeyItsPixel and u/WardenElite. 24 hours later, we were over 100k people. Those we're early days, and it was wild, but we decided to be a sub of honor and mutual respect, and of fairness and free speech. He was invited because of his values, and they stayed true in his speech and character the whole way.\\n\\nHe helped us build a lot of what we have. He offered most of the AMA guests by using his real name to get them on the YouTube stream. He was in mod chat daily, sometimes for 20 hours a day, encouraging us and guiding many of the mods while rensole or I could not be there. When the Banner Contest hit snags, he was there to give management guidance. He would also talk to us individually in private chats and make sure we were okay. He seemed to truly care about the mods and the progress the sub could make.\\n\\nStonkU2 has been somewhat distant for a couple weeks now and I'm so happy to see him come out into the sunlight. I am sad to see a mod resign but I agree his public role can be so much more impactful to the community and less ties to the mods only enables him further. u/StonkU2 thank you for your honesty and courage to come forward and say all of this.

By the end of this posts, **Kenny will be FULLY EXPOSED!**\\n\\n\\\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n**HOW AND WHY TO BANKRUPT COMPANIES**\\n\\nWhile a company is heading to bankruptcy (still not bankrupt), they keep shorting and shorting with those naked shares created to drop the price, once they used a share too many times (too many IOUs) they either pack them into trust bonds (for more liquidity for fuckery) and sell them or dump them into a bank ETF (that also tanks the price in the main exchange while also “hiding” the naked shares).\\n\\n**Seriously Kenny?**\\n\\n**Then they try so hard to bankrupt the company.** The company shares are now worthless so they don’t need to return any naked shares they produced (and I think they don’t even need to pay tax on the difference they make). They made a shit ton of money on betting against the company with options (puts) predicting the company is going down while manipulating the price the whole time.\\n\\nSo Kenny has been shorting this companies for a reason: yes, it makes him a shit ton of money.\\n\\nIs that his goal though? No.\\n\\n**His goal is to be the king of everything, to own it all. But how does shorting companies help him achieve that?** Additionally, if he truly is shorting treasury bonds it is because he expects a lack of solvency on the part of the Fed.\\n\\nso lets keep looking at how he does it. **Bloody King of fake shares (nothing) Kenny.** Yikes!\\n\\nWhen the company is worthless it is then the best time for Shitadel to buy the business shares super cheap **along with the real estate! They also buy the business debt providing leverage to the banks.**\\n\\nBankruptcy is wonderful for buying real estate at a deep discount. We know he\\'s gobbling up as much as he can get and land is a *tangible asset.*\\n\\nThey use third party real estate investment companies such IOR Inc (very very shady) that invest in real estate though direct equity. I’ll share more details later on.\\n\\nLet’s continue…\\n\\nSo we know they buy the real estate, the assets, the shares but what we don’t know is…. **They also buy the business\\'s debt** (all dirt cheap!!). **BUYING THE DEBT provide leverage against the banks.**\\n\\n**but the bubble is bigger!**\\n\\nThey have previously flooded the banks ETFs with heaps and heaps of naked shares and when the Kenny go to rebuy the company shares back from the bank the bank don’t want to sell in a huge loss! (the company shares worth almost nothing!) So they keep the leverage.\\n\\nBut not only Shitadel is doing that,\\n\\nAll his friends are doing it too!!!!! (Melvin, Susquehanna and others). Shorting the government bonds and business debt means the have big leverage on the banks. **Owning big pieces of the major banks means they own big part of the Federal Reserve bank (the machine that goes brrrrr).**\\n\\n\\\\----------------------------------------------\\n\\n**QUICK RECAP MIXING GME IN:**\\n\\nDraining money from the Businesses, shareholders and scamming people with his empty shells of **TRUST BONDS. That\\'s where the liquidity is coming from!**\\n\\n**So where does GME come into play with this scheme? Ill elaborate lot more later on!**\\n\\n**GME resisted and didn’t break or bankrupt (thank you papa RC, DFV and every single one of you magnificent apes)**, instead it went **up!**\\n\\nKenny then tried **harder and harder to break it (kept doubling and doubling down)**, but he didn’t expect **retail to be so resilient** and not give up, also he **didn’t expect RC to come and transform the company!**\\n\\nRC did something that most of us don’t see as a big deal, but is **a MASSIVE FU\\\\*\\\\*ING DEAL. HE GOT RID OF THE DEBT!!!** Now GME is free!!

Using those third party realty investors!\\n\\nBasically give the **BAG** to the bank and leave them **HOLDING IT!!**\\n\\nGuess who has a SHIT TON OF REAL ESTATE???\\n\\nYou guessed right!!! GME AND AMC!!! Woooohoool\\n\\nhttps://outline.com/pTpkmm\\n\\nSO where is the bubble?\\n\\nLike professor Jhon Griffin said on that glorious article.... Some institutions are BACKING their loans with \"AAA\" bonds thats really are \"BBB\".\\n\\n**I bet if those banks open the bags of Kenny\\'s Trust Bonds THEY ARE GOING TO FIND OUR PRECIOUS GME NAKED SHARES IN IT!!!! MADE UP MONEY!!**\\n\\nEDIT:!!!!——- THERE IS MORE!!!!\\n\\nWAIT WHAT??\\n\\nI think they are doing extra fukery here with the real estate and the banks based on the article here!!\\n\\nI found this little article on the floor of the internet!!\\n\\nhttps://theintercept.com/2021/04/23/deconstructed-whistleblower-financial-crisis/\\n\\nThis article says that commercial mortgages are being resold, but the borrower\\'s info is being inflated to make the mortgage more valuable to the new buyer.\\n\\nOhhhh opportunity for fukery I see!!\\n\\n**crazy talk over here…. So what they could be doing is… follow me on this one**\\n\\nIs it possible that leased real estate from those companies they are trying to bankrupt can be collateralized for loans by a third party? \\n\\nYES!\\n\\nSo…..\\n\\nThey buy the property (not from game stop but form the current owners of the real estate) with a loan trough a third party realty investor that uses equity to get the loans (the property appraisal then is inflated so the loan is higher). \\n\\nThey get the loan for the appraised amount first and put the current GameStop lease as collateral. No liability for Citadel, is using a third party, equity from non existing money (the trust bonds money) and the current GameStop lease as collateral (GameStop is not planning to move or leave for a while!)\\n\\nWhith the bigger loan they buy the property cheaper (at the price really worth not the inflated appraisal price) and pocket the difference.\\n\\nOnce GameStop bankrupt then the they stop paying  the loan and let it defaults, the collateral is gone!.\\n\\nNow the bank has to sell the property (usually action), citadel uses the third party again and buys the property dirt cheap at auction with equity again (yup money from the trust bonds!) at lower prices.\\n\\nIt’s a delicious double wash! BOOM! 🤯 \\n\\n**BOOM!**\\n\\nThey don’t buy the real estate directly tho. They are using this CITY TERRACE LLCand others, this is how I connected citadel with them \\n\\nI started here\\n\\nhttps://opencorporates.com/companies?q=CITADEL+SECURITIES+LLC\\n\\nAfter following the Dallas TX address lead me here\\n\\nThen got here: \\nhttps://opencorporates.com/companies/us_de/5634119\\n\\n1999 BRYAN ST STE 900\\nDALLAS TX 75201\\xa0- 3140\\n\\nThat Address connects directly to this address \\n\\n3700 N.

That one is about to explode soon!\\n\\nHe knew a lot of banks are gonna struggle and possibly get margin called for all those years of been manipulating Libor! When they change to SOFR (Read part 3 to fully understand).\\n\\nAlso he owns both sides of the leverage, he’s shorting because he things the government is gonna struggle or even default soon so he shorted, then he has the leverage with all those bonds to ask for favors or just wait until until the market recover and win washing the trust bonds into juicy 10 year bonds successfully!\\n\\n——————\\n\\n**KENNY\\'S FUCKED UP!!**\\n\\n**He fucked up with GME.**\\n\\nIf Kenny succeeded bankrupting GME, he efficiently would of succeed in draining a billion dollar company, taking a shit ton of money from retail, scamming the people he sold those trust bonds as well keeping the assets and team state of GME.\\n\\nAlso getting away with overshooting a company in order to buy treasury washing that money and the money changing hands successfully!\\n\\nWhy GME??\\n\\n**speculation based on actions, timing, events and behavior by all parties**\\n\\nBecause he is targeting BRICK AND MORTAR companies to wash the money in REAL ESTATE!\\n\\nHe needed extra money to buy those treasuries in bargain and over short GME!\\n\\nShitadel was shorting GME for a while and DFV knew that, They also thought it was a sure deal!\\n\\nAlso,\\n\\nHe uses real estate to wash the trust bonds. He is buying real estate using stock and derivates as collateral!!

(**Savirour of the people right?**)\\n\\n***Really Kenny?***\\n\\nHe also lent more and more money overseas to win with the transaction rates and the juicy 12%+ interest rates. Then wanted to cover everything and blame the PANDEMIC!

Exposed by a fucking Melon?\\n\\nKENNY FUCKED UP in GME big time!\\n\\nHe overshorted GME thinking was a sure deal and not calculating the risks. HE MESSED WITH GAMERS!!\\n\\nMy logic (watching his videos and history of Reddit messages in the past 2 years)tell me that DFV was looking at GME for a while (burry too, I don’t mean they communicate or talk) and when he saw that shitadel (and friends) increased their short position heaps, plus he saw following Dr Michael Burry tweets https://imgur.com/gallery/vivSs5f (he was listening to burry, finally someone did), he bought the long calls\\n\\nThat makes complete sense to me!! The company was greatly undervalued and wasn’t going that bad really. I saw his entire analysis and hypothesis.\\n\\nCheck it out https://youtu.be/GZTr1-Gp74U\\n\\n——————\\n\\nSo for Kenny to keep succeeding, he needed to stay quiet, but he woke an army of APES!! He woke up retail!!\\n\\nAlso now 0.01%, the government and banks realized that GME wasn’t going bankrupt and that Kenny has been scamming like that all along!! The shit pop out of the lid! And leaked too much!\\n\\nAfter reading this (HOPE THE MEDIA AND THE SEC READS IT).\\n\\nMaybe, just maybe they don’t know! Maybe I just figure Kenny’s game and I’m first to the punch!\\n\\nWhatever it is, we need to expose this everywhere! This needs to stop! This parasite in the market and economy needs to stop!

        "thought": "The certificate information shows that \"global-ultimate.com\" is using a free Let's Encrypt certificate, which is a common and legitimate choice for SSL certificates. The certificate is relatively new, consistent with the recent domain registration. While the use of Let's Encrypt is not a scam indicator on its own, the newness of both the domain and the certificate, combined with the other red flags raised earlier, contributes to the suspicion. I have gathered several pieces of information that suggest the website \"global-ultimate.com\" may be a scam. The high promised returns, referral program, mobile contact number, use of a privacy service, and the recent creation of the domain all raise red flags. I do not need to conduct further actions as I believe I have enough information to make a conclusion. I now know the final answer. Based on the observations and the characteristics of scam websites, there is a strong indication that \"global-ultimate.com\" could be a scam site.",
