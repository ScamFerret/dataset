Despite the fact we are all in our 30s, people still fall for scams every day, and a lot of this is due to e.g. YouTube content \"exposing\" scams with the intention of making you think you what\\'s going on, but trust me, they are always one step ahead of you..\\n\\nThere was a guy in the GE offering to buy feathers for above-GE value to avoid trade limits. I figured if I just avoided PVP worlds, trading next to doors, etc -- all the normal tricks, that I\\'d be fine. I trade him the feathers, and he thanks me, but doesn\\'t turn private on or ask to add me.\\n\\nI see the same character a day or two later buying feathers again. I had a massive stack of feathers in my bank and took out 30k noted blocks of them to trade him. Again, he just paid and said thanks. I asked him to add me but he didn\\'t respond, but after harassing him for a bit he finally did and sent me a PM along the lines of \"Look, I know you think I am a scammer, but I\\'m not, I just have a fucked up life situation and grinding out 95 fletching for the elite desert diary is the only thing keeping me together\". \\n\\nAt this point I almost let my guard slip, but kept engaging him. We chatted on-and-off for a while in-game before he asks for my discord. We talk there, and lo and behold, he says he is working on a RuneLite plugin. He sends me a .zip, but when I extracted it, instead of just being a .jar file, all of the source code and manifests and IDE build files were there. I work as a programmer and was able to open it all up in IntelliJ and look at it.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t find anything malicious in the code, and even ran it on a dummy account with some debug tools and no values like bank pin or similar were accessed at any point. It was a plugin meant to stop the tendency for prayers to \"flicker\" when enabled/disabled rapidly, which turns out is not easy to fix, but nonetheless it was not a phishing plugin.\\n\\nFast forward a few weeks, we\\'ve been chatting about our shared interest in RL plugins, I let him know about an upcoming business trip I\\'m going on. Turns out he lives in the same city. I hate my job and the people I work with, and needed an excuse to duck out of the after-work dinners at Chili\\'s or whatever, so I say, \"hey, let\\'s grab a few beers\". He says sure.\\n\\nWe end up having quite a bit than just a few beers, and personally, I ended up having one of the best nights of my life -- He lived just down the street from the bar we were at, and invited me to crash at his place...without getting too much into the details...we ended up learning a lot about ourselves that we didn\\'t know before.....\\n\\nI rebooked my ticket to stay the weekend with him -- which was wonderful -- and on Sunday night I noticed he was acting odd and fiddling with his phone before getting into bed. Exactly 25 minutes later an alarm goes off and he says he needs to go deal with something. (Hint: the idle logout timer has a 30 minute maximum). He\\'s gone for about 15 minutes and I get up to go find him .....\\n\\n....And find my laptop still logged in. All my bank, gone. Full black d\\'hide, 10k rune arrows, d med, d chain, d legs & my whip, gone. Over 5k ess and ALL my firelighters.
