        "thought": "The extracted text shows that the website is promoting unusually high returns on investments, which is characteristic of many scam websites. It mentions guaranteed exceptional returns and safety of the invested capital, which could be targeting human psychological weaknesses for quick financial gain. Additionally, the website promotes anonymity in payments via cryptocurrency which is not a common payment method for legitimate investment firms and also raises concerns about the privacy of customer information. The contact information includes an email address that doesn't seem to be formatted for business use (it uses a general support prefix rather than a corporate domain), and the phone number provided could be a personal number rather than a business line. There's also a lack of detailed information about the company's legal status, which could mean it's non-existent. The SSL certificate presence doesn't mitigate these red flags. With all these observations, including the absence of social proof or user-generated discussions on Reddit and Twitter, and the lack of recent updates on their information, it seems that the website fits the profile of a scam site. I now know the final answer. Based on the characteristics of scam websites and the observations from the actions taken, it is likely that https://digitalgoldedge.com/ is a scam website.",
