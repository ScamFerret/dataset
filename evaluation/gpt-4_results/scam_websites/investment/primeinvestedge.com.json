The investment returns promised seem unusually high and guaranteed, which is generally not possible in legitimate financial investments due to market volatility. 2. The website claims to have a significant number of investments and assets under management, which needs to be verified. 3. The website mentions regulatory bodies like the SEC and IIROC, which should be checked for authenticity. 4. The contact information provided includes a generic email address (admin@primeinvestedge.com) and a phone number; this information should be verified for legitimacy. 5. There are references to being able to withdraw as soon as the investment duration is completed, which could target psychological desires for quick and easy money.

I\\'ve sent a Notice and Takedown request to GitHub, in addition to asking them to take more permanent actions than just taking the page down again.\\n\\nHere\\'s what I\\'ve discovered about the scam:\\n\\n* The way this scam operates is mainly through Discord. You\\'ll receive a message from a Discord friend to test a game for a friend of theirs, and once you run the .exe, the attacker will make his way into your account. Then he\\'ll do the same to all of your friends.\\n* I\\'m sure you know never to pay blackmailers, but just to put this out there: I\\'ve seen proof that if you pay the scammer, he\\'ll just beg for more money even if you have literally none. Don\\'t trust him, you will get nothing back.\\n* The executable that\\'s masquerading as Altered Alma is from the \"Grabushka infostealer\" malware family. It\\'s Malware as a Service, meaning the scammers are mostly script kiddies. You can sometimes catch them bluffing with a little bit of technical know-how. Maybe you\\'re even able to fetch some personal details and pass them on to the police ;)\\n* When you run the malware, it will continously steal all your cookies and stored data, in every browser and most apps you have installed. That means if you make a new account *after* running the executable, that account\\'s login will likely also be sent to the attacker.\\n* Thankfully, the variant we\\'ve encountered was pretty mild; it had no persistence (meaning if you restarted your system it\\'d stop until you manually ran it again). But I\\'ve heard from a reputable source that some variants of the malware are very persistent and can basically only be stopped through a complete system reinstall.\\n\\nSome domains previously seen:  \\ncosmoswaves\\\\[.\\\\]github\\\\[.\\\\]io, reckonvania\\\\[.\\\\]github\\\\[.\\\\]io, reckonvania\\\\[.\\\\]com, reckonedgegame\\\\[.\\\\]com, galacticnexus\\\\[.\\\\]github\\\\[.\\\\]io nexusreckonn\\\\[.\\\\]github\\\\[.\\\\]io, redialconundrum\\\\[.\\\\]netlify\\\\[.\\\\]app, nexusreckonalpha\\\\[.\\\\]github\\\\[.\\\\]io, reckonedge\\\\[.\\\\]github\\\\[.\\\\]io, reckonedge\\\\[.\\\\]com, nexusreckongame\\\\[.\\\\]com, nexusreckon\\\\[.\\\\]net, nexusreckongame\\\\[.\\\\]com, fivertexstudio\\\\[.\\\\]github\\\\[.\\\\]io/nexusreckon, redialconundrum\\\\[.\\\\]vercel\\\\[.\\\\]app, nexusreckon\\\\[.\\\\]com, vaniapunkalpha\\\\[.\\\\]vercel\\\\[.\\\\]app, nexusreckon\\\\[.\\\\]github\\\\[.\\\\]io, vaniapunkgame\\\\[.\\\\]com, vania-punk\\\\[.\\\\]vercel\\\\[.\\\\]app, vaniapunkgame\\\\[.\\\\]com, vaniapunk\\\\[.\\\\]vercel\\\\[.\\\\]app, vaniapunkalpha\\\\[.\\\\]github\\\\[.\\\\]io, vaniapunk\\\\[.\\\\]org, vaniapunkgames\\\\[.\\\\]github\\\\[.\\\\]io, articpunk\\\\[.\\\\]dev, amber-punk\\\\[.\\\\]netlify\\\\[.\\\\]app, punkvania\\\\[.\\\\]com, articpunk\\\\[.\\\\]org, articpunk\\\\[.\\\\]net, articpunk\\\\[.\\\\]com, articpunkbeta\\\\[.\\\\]github\\\\[.\\\\]io', \"I just had this happen.
