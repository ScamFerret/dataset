There are also indications that the company's presence is not evident on consumer review platforms or social media, which is a red flag. Given that there are reports of the company promising substantial returns and then disappearing, it aligns with the characteristics of a scam site, particularly targeting human psychological weaknesses (Characteristic 3) and information on non-existent companies (Characteristic 4).
