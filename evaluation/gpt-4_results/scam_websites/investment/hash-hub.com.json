Today I come with an important update release with some major changes and improvements.\\n\\n**UPDATE:**\\n\\niSecureOS v1.12 Beta 1 is now out on the repo.\\nThis update brings Deep scanning for malware.\\n\\nThe deep-scan toggle is optional, and only recommended if you have suspicions of an infection as it takes many minutes to complete the system-wide scan.\\n\\n****************************************************\\n\\nAs of Beta 1 v1.09 available now on the repo, iSecureOS:\\n\\n* **Can detect the recent pirate repo malware files that were floating around**. It\\'s a pretty serious backdoor with possibility for the pirate repo to run arbitrary commands as root on your device. They also did not deny the existence of the malware, just claimed they \"won\\'t use it for bad things\" (yeah, sure, meet you in Shanghai...).\\n* The detection is done through hashing rather than file names, so no matter how they named the file, it should still be detected. Will keep an eye on their repos and update the hashes on GitHub (from where the app fetches them at scan time) so that you get updated signatures for detection. I hope to make the hashes database bigger in the future as I add to it.\\n* Vulnerabilities now have color codes. Red = malware or urgent threat. Orange = Important issue, but not urgent. Yellow = least important, usually security tip or recommendation. This way I hope people get less confused.\\n* Fixed MANY of the bugs reported by the community, including some repos being flagged inaccurately, and the iPad landscape bug. Thanks for all the reports. Love you guys.\\n* The app now fetches the repo definitions in encoded base64 format to avoid leaving a plain-text list of pirate repos on Github (even though everybody and their dog knows there repos anyways).\\n* The app will now scan for malware your MobileSubstrate dylibs and tweaks. This CAN take a while depending on how many you have.\\n* Improved detection for VPN, now with support for even more interfaces.\\n* Added back button for iOS 12 devices because they do not have the modals we use on iOS 13 and 14.\\n* Open sourced the application under GPL v2. Feel free to contribute.\\n\\nAll in all, v1.09 Beta 1 is a major release for iSecureOS which I hope will help you.\\n\\n**REPO**\\n\\nThe repo is https://isecureos.idevicecentral.com/repo\\n\\nWarning:\\nWhile this app now has the feature to detect malware, we rely on hashes of files in my database. So, this app won\\'t do malware detection in real-time and won\\'t do heuristic scans (that would be doable on iOS but extremely slow and very flase-positive-prone). I will, however, try to maintain the database with new malware as it gets discovered in the community. Thankfully, the occurrence is rather limited.\\n\\n*Obligatory links*\\n\\nI demand nothing in exchange for this application, but if you wanna do me a good deed, you can follow me on Twitter or check out my Jailbreak channel.\\n\\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/FCE365\\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/isecureos\\n* YouTube: https//youtube.com/idevicecentral\\n\\nAlso:\\nSource Code: https://github.com/GeoSn0w/iSecureOS\\n\\n*REMEMBER*\\n\\nThis application is FREE.

Issues with formatting, approach, client choice, etc. are all great things to come talk to me about so I may improve. However, people keep commenting the same things over and over and over — “VirusTotal can’t catch X” is a popular one — and I don’t have time to deal with it. If you have a security concern, you are more than welcome to raise it. HOWEVER, do not make unreasonable requests of me — I work, in addition to that I have a social life, I have responsibilities at home as well. This is a side thing that I do when I have the time. A lot of people have suggested looking through bytecode to determine if a client is malicious. I do not have the time to do this for every client. If you are willing to help and do more than say “you should do more than you already are, even though you have a job and a life outside of an obscure subreddit,” feel free to DM me. People who take the broken record approach and say things that are already covered in the thread, or refuse to offer help and just post complaints, will be blocked and ignored. I’m all down for making this post better, but I’m not gonna waste my time with people who won’t work with me. Thank you for your help!***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n***BIG THANKS TO*** u/jpie726 ***FOR HIS MASSIVE CONTRIBUTIONS! WITHOUT HIM THIS LIST WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPANSIVE. GO UPVOTE THIS MAN INTO HEAVEN, HE DESERVES IT!***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Eventually I would like to make a Python script that takes care of all the necessary tasks to install these clients. Python itself is available through the* [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-37/9nj46sx7x90p?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) *as well as on Python\\'s website, or through various other installers. It will install any additional dependencies via Pip and will use Curl to retrieve the files. Anyone interested in helping with this script is more than welcome to do so, if you wish. The two options for assisting me would be as follows:*\\n\\n*1. You can install Visual Studio Code or Atom and work with me directly through those applications (more details soon™)*\\n\\n*2. A GitHub page may be made and you could submit pull requests through that and edit the script alone.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\#######################################################################\\n\\n**There is a misconception that I am only here for free paid clients.**\\n\\n**1. I can\\'t use a paid client unless I have access to a cracked version, an account, and the HWID bound to said account.**\\n\\n**2. People are also saying there\\'s a way for clients to track if someone leaks them. While I suppose this is possible if they bothered to put in the absurd amount of effort it would take, it would give them no benefit and it would do no good as I am not running the software on my desktop -- I am sending the software to VirusTotal, grabbing the SHA-256 checksum, and deleting the file.**\\n\\n**3. If all you\\'re going to do is post that \"VirusTotal can\\'t catch x\" or \"muh client\" do not waste my time, and don\\'t waste yours. You will be ignored in favor of people who will actually help me construct what I hope to be a megathread for this subreddit, FOR YOU GUYS. I mean jeez, someone\\'s trying to help and half the fucking responses are \"muh client\" like come on. No wonder this fucking subreddit is dead, sheesh. If someone\\'s trying to help you and you just step on their toes that\\'s just not very cool, not everyone is trying to scam you. I do just be trying to help people who come here doe.**\\n\\n**4. If you have concerns, raise them respectfully. Do not attack me, you will be ignored or if I feel so inclined I will give you 110% of the shit you give me right back to you. I will answer questions, I will elaborate on my goals, I will take** ***helpful*** **advice. Everything else will be outright ignored, and misinformation will be countered. That is all, thread below.**\\n\\n\\\\#######################################################################\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI named this the Checker Thread to make it easy to search for in the subreddit. Enjoy.Below will be a list of hacked clients, with VirusTotal links, SHA-256 hashes, direct download links (skipping ad pages) and eventually features for each client. I\\'d also like to add what servers they do and don\\'t work on, but I need **the community to help with that**.\\n\\nThe only client I use is Impact, send me additional clients in the comments and they will be added to this list.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Note about SHA-256 hashes:**\\n\\nSHA-256 hashes are a hash of a file produced algorithmically. This type of hash was developed by the United States National Security Agency, and is typically used to verify that files are what they are supposed to be. Widely used in cryptographic applications such as SSH, APT repositories, transactions on websites, verifying files, Bitcoin, and more. It is very common. This type of cryptographic hash has been in use since 2001. An SHA-256 hash will be the exact same for the same file regardless of the source of the file, so if your hash is different from the one listed here ***you do not have the legitimate installer OR the hash is not up-to-date.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Note about VirusTotal tests:**\\n\\nSeveral people have pointed out to me something I feel should be brought up in the main thread. VirusTotal is not a catch-all, just as your typical antivirus software is not a catch-all. ***It will not catch everything.*** It should be used as a *general guideline only*. Clean VirusTotal tests do not guarantee your safety, although if the program passes all \\\\~70 or so antivirus engines it\\'s *probably* safe to use. Any additional malicious activity *should* be caught by your antivirus program\\'s heuristics. I take no responsibility for anything that is malicious, but I can say in good conscience that I have done everything I can to ensure that everything on this thread is safe. Keep in mind that programs that trip VirusTotal *may still be safe to use*, antivirus programs often pick up injectors as malware or Trojans because that\\'s how those types of viruses behave in the real world. Use your best judgement. If your best judgement is not good enough, do not use these programs. You have been warned.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\----- C --- L --- I --- E --- N --- T--- S ------ C --- L --- I --- E --- N --- T--- S ------ C --- L --- I --- E --- N --- T--- S -----\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Impact** | 1.11.2 to 1.15.2 | Java Edition\\n\\n[VirusTotal Link for \\\\*.exe Installer](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4eaffb99759fbd949d0fbef58ae9ceb45ce8ca2b0d7dc22147d4ff0e46f010ec/detection) | [VirusTotal Link for \\\\*.jar Installer](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/51eeec58e24bca244a81753f347cc653404a28a9d783d9e4e3a2a94e3806f107/detection)\\n\\nSHA-256 Hash: `4EAFFB99759FBD949D0FBEF58AE9CEB45CE8CA2B0D7DC22147D4FF0E46F010EC`\\n\\nImpact triggered `0/72` engines on both installers.\\n\\n[Direct Link to Impact\\'s \\\\*.exe Installer](https://impactclient.net/?brady-money-grubbing-completed=true&amp;platform=exe) | [Direct Link to Impact\\'s \\\\*.jar Installer](https://impactclient.net/?brady-money-grubbing-completed=true&amp;platform=jar)\\n\\n\\\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Sigma** | 1.8 to 1.16 | Java Edition\\n\\n[VirusTotal Link for \\\\*.jar Installer](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/30ddd651b5a776f1ffde6ca5d041e7eeca8ba7e0e4c8a1e4d73c69e74339e6b9/detection) | [VirusTotal Link for the \\\\*.zip the Installer is Contained In](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3fcd397849358522bf0eeeaf117487dba860919900a904551df512be2c34b48c/detection)\\n\\nSHA-256 Hash for the \\\\*.zip file: `3FCD397849358522BF0EEEAF117487DBA860919900A904551DF512BE2C34B48C`\\n\\nSigma\\'s \\\\*.zip file triggered `0/59` engines on the \\\\*.zip file.\\n\\nSigma\\'s \\\\*.jar file triggered `0/60` engines on the \\\\*.jar file.\\n\\n[Direct Link to Sigma\\'s \\\\*.zip File that Contains the Installer](https://sigmaclient.info/Sigma5.zip)\\n\\n\\\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**9b9t** | 1.12.2, needs testing | Java Edition | Forge Mod\\n\\n[VirusTotal Link for the \\\\*.jar Forge Mod](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/30e4f2778688d54ce7992afde509460a7bddbda77800219083d4d12bc696eea0/detection)\\n\\nSHA-256 Hash: `30E4F2778688D54CE7992AFDE509460A7BDDBDA77800219083D4D12BC696EEA0`\\n\\n9b9t triggered `0/60` engines.\\n\\n[AnonFile link to 9b9t\\'s \\\\*.jar Mod](https://anonfiles.com/Dbn8X7H5o1/9b9t-1.0_jar)\\n\\n\\\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Ingrosware** | 1.12.2 | Java Edition | Forge Mod\\n\\n[VirusTotal Link for the \\\\*.jar Forge Mod](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bd1a0f9079f4c834a251163c3a0ecbff7dfc28ab00cf1c74008aadd042fad358/detection)\\n\\nSHA-256 Hash: `BD1A0F9079F4C834A251163C3A0ECBFF7DFC28AB00CF1C74008AADD042FAD358`\\n\\nIngrosware triggered `0/59` engines.\\n\\n[AnonFile link to a pre-built \\\\*.jar Mod](https://anonfiles.com/99bbY5H0od/ingrosware-1.0-full_jar)\\n\\n*Note: Ingrosware is open source, and is available on GitHub.

DO NOT LET PEOPLE TELL YOU OTHERWISE\" very false, ill get to that in a minute.\\n\\nFirstly, you can not crack/all/most clients with just the installer and without the information, I find that kind of funny, let\\'s say they have simple installer. The installer sends a request to a  URL, with login information and or a HWID, the server checks the information and if it\\'s valid, then send a jar file, otherwise they do not(you don\\'t have the users information, so you can not get the jar). That is a simple installer, yes some could be stupid and have the client download as a string in the installer, but that\\'s unlikely.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSecond of all, what I said I would get into in a minute. A simple(a little advanced) system implemented by a client that could detect who leaked a jar file. For example, they could upload the unobfuscated jar to the server(somewhere hidden, and inaccessible due to a htaccess file), or upload a slightly obfuscated jar, when a user requests the download, they could have their obfuscator(uploaded on the server), obfuscate the client, and link the mappings to the users account, the obfuscator could also hide other stuff in the jar(that a cracker would not notice, meaning its \"unremovable\". and link that information to a users account). Meaning when the jar is cracked and leaked. The owner could look at the jar, and the information linked to all users account and find who leaked the jar and terminate their account.
