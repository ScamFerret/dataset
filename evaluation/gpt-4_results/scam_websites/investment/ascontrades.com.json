Over the next few days we got a total of 1000+ one star rating and our overall rating came down to less than 1.45stars from 4.89stars.

Less people started installing our extension.\\n\\nWe noticed that at the same time, there was a new extension in the same category which got 700 five star ratings in one single day - the day it was launched. On closer inspection, we found that it contained malware as well. Also, all the extensions in the \"night mode\" category had received 1000s of one-star ratings in one day, but this extension was getting only five-star ratings. \\n\\nWe reported it to google, but they took over a week to respond, and when they did, all they did was remove that extension. So, our rating remained at the lowly 1.45 stars. The more I researched, I found that this is happening all across the chrome webstore. So, beware of installing non reputed chrome extensions. Google is not doing a good enough job at maintaing a good store.\\n\\nTl;Dr - We made a browser extension which changes all the websites into dark mode. We initially got 50+ good revieiws, but then suddenly got 1000+ one star ratings, and we lost the rankings in the chrome webstore.', 'Shocking, utterly shocking! People cheat to get ahead.

        "thought": "The SSL certificate information is valid, and it's from Let's Encrypt, which is a legitimate certificate authority. However, having an SSL certificate does not confirm the legitimacy of the business it represents. The presence of a wildcard SSL certificate for multiple subdomains could be normal for a business with several services, but it's not enough to conclude the legitimacy of the site. Considering the information I have gathered so far, it's time to make a determination about the site. Based on the unusually high returns, the claim of free unlimited transfers, the recent creation of the domain, privacy protection to hide the owner's details, and the lack of concrete proof of the company's legitimacy, there are several red flags that suggest this website could be a scam. Based on the observations and characteristics of scam websites, I now know the final answer.",
