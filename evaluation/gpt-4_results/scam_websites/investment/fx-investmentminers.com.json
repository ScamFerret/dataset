        "thought": "The website text contains several red flags that are common in scam websites, such as promises of high returns on investments (e.g., \"Profit: 10% Weekly\" and \"Profit: 6% Daily\"), which are unusually high and could be unrealistic. The investment plans and the claims of being a global leader without much evidence to support it raise suspicion. I also notice that the text includes a physical address and a phone number, which I will need to verify for legitimacy.",
