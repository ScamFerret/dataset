You have the option of having a [hardware wallet](https://i0.wp.com/cryptoguide.tips/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Hardware-Wallet-Comparison-1.png?resize=740%2C416&ssl=1) or [software wallet](https://imgur.com/a/QRkzIrt). \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Many hardware wallet solutions, many have their own unique features and software compatibilities.](https://preview.redd.it/9m3eog4oysvb1.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ddc8f24de4228d13dfe2b3b75e5359598cdb8c4)\\n\\nIn simple terms, these wallets allow you to hold and store your digital assets from your CEX to your crypto wallet. When you set up a software or hardware wallet, you generally create a public key (public wallet address) and private key (your seed or digital keys- something you never share with anyone).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Some Top multi-coin software wallets that are trusted by many users in the industry to store different coins and tokens that work on different blockchain networks.](https://preview.redd.it/wx2ixbz6zsvb1.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=78cd1c0c12fdadbcc7494804279463bdbc679ef5)\\n\\nOnce set up, you can perform a test transaction to send from the CEX to your public wallet address. Once a transaction is initiated, you can see the status of your coin/token on something called an explorer. There are coin specific explorers, but if you are new you can use a popular multi coin explorers like [https://www.blockchain.com/](https://www.blockchain.com/). (you simply put a tx or public address and it tells you if a transaction is pending and things like balances or past transactions sent from a specific wallet address).\\n\\nSecuring your seed safely and self custody-ing your digital assets puts you 1 major step away from potentially losing access to your funds. There are many top exchanges that we all trust and many that keep their business safe and secure. However, there are many forces outside of our control over what goes on with the assets on many centralized exchanges. For many, knowing that our long term assets are sitting in a secure self custody wallet keeps us safer and more permissionless.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;', 'comments': ['[Tip this post](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?contentId=t3_17e0xcx).', 'No shit, Sherlock.\\n\\n2022 has been THE year showing that everything except self-custody is a death sentence in Crypto.', '\\\\[AutoMod\\\\] Strategy', 'I prefer self custody and even yields are better on Defi.

If you try and bruteforce it - the odds of getting it correct are 1 in 531,441\\n>    * Moon\\n>    * System\\n>    * Dog\\n> * ~~Hint 2 - Post age 9 hours~~\\n> * ~~Hint 3 - Post age 24 hours~~\\n\\nWith the right tools, this hint makes the entire challenge irrelevant. A normal consumer GPU can brute force 500k seeds in under a minute, and I\\'m going to show you how in this post.\\n\\nFirst, we\\'re going to use the open source tool [btcrecover](https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to handle the brute forcing and dictate what format the data we need to collect should be in.\\n\\nReading through the btcrecover documentation, it seems like we\\'ll need an AddressDB (which is a list of addresses in a binary format) that includes the target address, and also a seedlist.\\n\\n## Getting address list\\n\\nWe need an AddressDB because one in ten seeds correspond to real addresses, but almost all of those addresses will have a zero balance. The OP said that the correct seed will have an amount of Dogecoin in it, so we need to get a list of Dogecoin addresses. \\n\\nTo get the AddressDB, we could [download the pre-made AddressDBs](https://cryptoguide.tips/btcrecover-addressdbs/) but note that it was last generated on 2021-04-17 - if the OP created and funded the account after that date, it won\\'t be on the list. So, we\\'ll need to generate a list ourselves, and the easiest way to do that is to head over to Google BigQuery.\\n\\nGoogle BigQuery maintains a public dataset of balance-holding Dogecoin addresses, and small queries like this are essentially free:\\n\\n    SELECT\\n      addresses[OFFSET(0)] AS address\\n    FROM\\n      `bigquery-public-data.crypto_dogecoin.outputs`\\n    WHERE\\n      addresses[OFFSET(0)] NOT LIKE \\'nonstandard%\\'\\n      AND\\n      block_timestamp > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 200 DAY)\\n    GROUP BY\\n      address\\n    \\nThis will return a list of addresses that have sent or received Dogecoin in the last 200 days. This dataset is 136 MB with 4,068,290 addresses. Getting the full list of all addresses that have ever had any activity would\\'ve been a lot larger (~8GB) but still doable. \\n\\nNext, we export this as a list of addresses. I saved it as `addrs.txt` and then we use btcrecover to convert it into an AddressDB, which is the format that btcrecover wants it in:\\n\\n    python3 create-address-db.py --inputlistfile addrs.txt --dbfilename addrs.db\\n\\n## Getting seed list\\n\\nNext, we just need a list of the 531,441 valid seeds. I messed around with the `tokenlist` feature of btcrecover before deciding to give up and just generate a file with all of the seeds. This is fast because, again, 500k is not that much:\\n\\n    k = [0] * 12\\n    for i in range(3**12):\\n      print(\" \".join([[\"moon\", \"system\", \"dog\"][x] for x in k]))\\n      if i == 3**12-1:\\n        break\\n      k[0] += 1\\n      for p in range(12):\\n        if k[p] == 3:\\n          k[p+1] += 1\\n          k[p] = 0\\n\\nThis outputs to stdout a file 33 MB that starts and ends like this: https://i.imgur.com/ZS0R7Gj.png\\n\\n## Putting it all together\\n\\nNow, we can just run btcrecover on the seedlist and AddressDB we created:\\n\\n    python3 seedrecover.py --dsw --seedlist seeds.txt --addressdb addrs.db --no-dupchecks --mnemonic-length 12 --language EN --addr-limit 1 --wallet-type dogecoin --enable-opencl\\n\\nAnd we get the correct seed in a few seconds. https://i.imgur.com/nLz8uMu.png\\n\\nThis is seed number 399339 of 531441 we\\'re brute forcing:\\n\\n    Seed found: moon moon system moon system dog system dog moon dog moon dog\\n\\nUnfortunately, I got the seed 35 minutes after the challenge ended - if I had seen the post earlier, anytime after the first hint was posted, I would\\'ve won. But I hope this post was informative and can help people in the future.', 'comments': ['Very cool!\\n\\nThis also demonstrates how the number of permutations explode by just adding a few more options\\n\\nThe OP of the challenge used 3 words = 3^12 = 531k possibilities \\n\\nIf they had used 5 instead there would have been ~244M possibilities\\n\\nAnd with 10 options there would be 1 trillion possibilities!

(a few sentences per features)\\n\\nI have put it here:  [https://cryptoguide.tips/hardware-wallet-comparisons/](https://cryptoguide.tips/hardware-wallet-comparisons/)  which basically gives you the \"summary\" as the initial view, with the fuller spreadsheet here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/134GQ4nvOpAFNKO5w0ZvbNGmfczj1PF18AI0BJwzVXx8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/134GQ4nvOpAFNKO5w0ZvbNGmfczj1PF18AI0BJwzVXx8/edit?usp=sharing)\\n\\nAnyway I just knocked this first draft out thisarv and am wondering if folks had suggestions about \"features\" that I had missed in my first pass or anything else like that. The hope is that it would be accessible enough for folk who post on /r/bitcoinbeginners (in terms of offering explanations about the stuff, with videos to come later) but also useful enough for someone who has been in the space for a year or so. (in terms of specific, technical info)\\n\\nI am happy to add other wallets later, but am basically limiting it to product categories that I have either used directly or indirectly.
