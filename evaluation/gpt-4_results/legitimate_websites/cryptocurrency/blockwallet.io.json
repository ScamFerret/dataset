As a self-custodial Web3 wallet, it empowers you to truly own your digital currencies while eliminating concerns surrounding asset management Our wallet boasts one of the most user-friendly interfaces in the industry, designed with an intuitive layout that simplifies even the most complex transactions for all user levels. Seamless navigation, clear visual aids, and a clean aesthetic make BlockWallet not just a tool, but a delightful experience for every user. Furthermore, BlockWallet takes pride in its super low transaction fees, making digital currency trading more accessible for everyone. The built-in gas extension is another standout feature, designed to predict and mitigate the often unpredictable Ethereum gas fees. This feature ensures you never have to overpay for transactions, making your crypto experience more efficient and cost-effective. What is a non custodial wallet A Non-Custodial Wallet, also known as a Self-Custodial Wallet or Self-Custody Wallet, is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that places complete control over digital assets in your hands. Unlike other wallet options where third parties have access to your private keys,** a Non-Custodial Wallet ensures only you possess these keys**. Essentially, this means that only you can access or move your cryptocurrencies - nobody else has this ability. This style of wallet provides unparalleled security and autonomy, allowing you to maintain total sovereignty over your digital assets. However, it's important to remember that the responsibility of keeping your keys and recovery phrases safe falls solely on you. In short, Non-Custodial Wallets put the 'private' back in private keys, giving you full control and ownership over your cryptocurrency assets. Why Self-Custody In Crypto Wallets Are Important The importance of self-custody in cryptocurrencies cannot be overstated. Self-custody crypto wallets offer users unparalleled control over their digital assets, ensuring that you alone have access to your funds. This level of personal control is crucial where centralized platforms can present significant risks. For example, centralized exchanges and wallets are frequent targets for hackers, and users may also face the risk of internal fraud, regulatory changes, or even bankruptcy—all of which can jeopardize the safety of your assets. The recent history of cryptocurrency has shown that these are not just theoretical risks; many investors have faced substantial losses in such scenarios. There were some cases where users could not withdraw their digital assets because centralized exchanges halted all withdrawals. Self-custody crypto wallets, such as BlockWallet, put the power firmly in your hands. These wallets, protected by private keys that you exclusively control, offer a level of security unattainable by centralized systems. Moreover, self-custody crypto wallets enhance your financial autonomy and privacy. Is BlockWallet Self custodial wallet Yes, indeed! BlockWallet certainly puts the \"self\" in \"self-custodial\"!

She wants to access the cryptocurrency stored on her previous computer using a similar web wallet on this new personal computer. She proceeds to search on Google, hoping to find the link to the website where she can download the web wallet extension in other to access her funds on the new computer. Caroline clicks a search result that takes her to the website she’s looking for (so she thought at least), she downloads the wallet and then imports her private keys into the wallet. Moments later, the funds in her wallet were erased before she could take control of them. What just happened? Sadly, Caroline has just been a victim of a wallet phishing scam. Unknown to her, she was interacting with a fake wallet that looked so similar to the one she had used before.\\n\\n**Does the story above sound familiar?** Well, that was just a hypothetical example of a clever phishing tactic that has been used by cryptocurrency scammers to successfully steal money from their victims. The truth is, you or someone you know might be the next phishing target **unless** certain precautions are taken (we talk more about that later).\\n\\nIn this short post, we would briefly explain **what phishing is**, **how it affects you**, and **how to avoid becoming the next victim.**\\n\\n# What is phishing?\\n\\n**Phishing** is a ‘clever tactic’ employed by a malicious actor(s) to steal sensitive information such as passwords, private keys, seed phrases, etc. from unsuspecting persons. In other words, it typically involves tricking a user into performing a seemingly legitimate action, granting/providing a certain request/information, which unknown to them would result in financial loss or harm after carrying out the operation.\\n\\n# How phishing affects you\\n\\nMany cyber-security experts acknowledge that phishing is one of the most commonly used tactics employed by cybercriminals to steal money and sensitive information from people on the internet today. What this means is that anytime you browse the internet today, you remain a potential target for phishing scams. Web3 users are also at the centre of being targets of phishing scams because it is far more difficult to recover stolen funds due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. With this background into the scale of phishing attacks, one can rightly agree that knowing ways to protect yourself from phishing would be one of the **smartest things to do.** *How then do you protect yourself from phishing?*\\n\\n# Ways to protect yourself from phishing\\n\\n* **Think before you act:** this involves rereading or rechecking a link to a website, an email, or a private message from someone you know (or who you think you know) for red flags. These red flags could include, pressuring you to **perform** a particular action immediately (eg reset your password, etc.)\\n* **Ensure you always check the URLs of websites you visit**: This involves looking for errors as they may likely contain misspellings, etc. (a common sign of being fake).\\n* **Try to stay updated on the latest phishing tactics: Be** interested in learning and using innovative ways (more info on that below) to protect yourself from scams like the one you are currently reading (yes, great job for reading this post to this point).\\n\\nFor a typical user of dApps (decentralized applications) like Caroline mentioned at the onset of this post, using a **web wallet** could potentially expose you to a similar phishing scam. It is of interest to know that one feature provided by BlockWallet protects users from wallet phishing attacks.\\n\\nWhat BlockWallet basically and intuitively does is that it gives your wallet what we may call a *“unique dress”* by using a complex design algorithm that would help a user separate a 'fake wallet' from the original. In other words, a unique piece of artwork is generated and shown to you anytime you attempt to login into the wallet or want to import a private key into the wallet.\\n\\nTo better understand this in a practical sense, let’s go back to the Caroline example cited at the onset of this post. If Caroline had been using BlockWallet, with this built-in **anti-phishing protection** **feature**, she would have more likely been able to spot a difference in the wallet she just downloaded as being fake since it would lack the unique generative art (aka the wallet dress) she was used to seeing on her previous computer. Quite an impressive feature, right? You can learn more about **BlockWallet** [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blockwallet/bopcbmipnjdcdfflfgjdgdjejmgpoaab).\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe reality is that you are not the only one affected by phishing, but it also in some way affects the number of new users willing to onboard into the web3 space. After hearing a series of reports about successful phishing scams, many potential new web3 users may likely feel disheartened to do so. The good news is that applying some of the suggestions mentioned, such as thinking before acting when you receive an email or message, staying informed about the latest phishing tactics used by cyber-criminals today, and then using tools like BlockWallet are steps you can take to protect yourself and others from phishing.\\n\\nFurther readings:\\n\\n* [https://help.blockwallet.io/hc/en-us/articles/4756464544657](https://help.blockwallet.io/hc/en-us/articles/4756464544657)\\n* [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-phishing](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-phishing)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**^(Disclaimer:)** ^(The information presented in this piece is merely for educational purposes only, it contains the viewpoint of the author, and does not constitute investment advice.
