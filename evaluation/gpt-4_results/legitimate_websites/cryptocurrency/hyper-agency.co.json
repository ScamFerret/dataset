Ads could feel like recommendations from a friend, tailored precisely to individual interests and needs.\\n* **AI-Powered Content Creation**: Struggling to keep up with social media demands? AI tools could help agencies and businesses generate everything from engaging captions to eye-catching product images.\\n* **Data Becomes Insight**: Meta AI excels at finding patterns in enormous datasets.

It\\'s essential for businesses to choose AI partners that prioritize transparency and ethical data use.

It featured a feminist activist pouring bleach on a male subway passenger for manspreading. It got instant attention, with millions of views and wide social media outrage. Reddit users wrote that it had turned them against feminism.\\n\\nThere was one problem: [The video was staged.](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/viral-manspreading-video-is-staged-kremlin-propaganda/) And In the Now, which publicized it, is a subsidiary of RT, formerly Russia Today, the Kremlin TV channel aimed at foreign, English-speaking audiences.\\n\\nAs an MIT study found in 2019, **Russia\\'s online influence networks** [**reached 140 million Americans**](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) **every month** \\\\-- the majority of U.S. social media users.\\xa0\\n\\n***Russia began using troll farms a decade ago to incite gender and racial divisions in the United States***\\xa0\\n\\nIn 2013, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a confidante of Vladimir Putin, founded the Internet Research Agency (the IRA) in St. Petersburg. It was the Russian government\\'s first coordinated facility to disrupt U.S. society and politics through social media.\\n\\nHere\\'s what Prigozhin [had to say](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-internet-research-agency-intl/index.html) about the IRA\\'s efforts to disrupt the 2022 election:\\n\\n>Gentlemen, we interfered, we interfere and we will interfere. Carefully, precisely, surgically and in our own way, as we know how. During our pinpoint operations, we will remove both kidneys and the liver at once.\\n\\nIn 2014, the IRA and other Russian networks began\\xa0[establishing fake U.S. activist groups on social media](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-internet-research-agency-intl/index.html). By 2015, [hundreds](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-whistle-blowing-troll-gets-her-day-in-court/27047858.html) of English-speaking young Russians worked at the IRA.\\xa0 Their assignment was to use those false social-media accounts, especially on Facebook and Twitter --\\xa0[but also on Reddit, Tumblr, 9gag](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43255285), and other platforms -- **to aggressively spread conspiracy theories and mocking, ad hominem arguments** **that incite American users.**\\n\\nIn 2017, U.S. intelligence found that **Blacktivist**, a Facebook and Twitter group with more followers than the official Black Lives Matter movement,\\xa0[was operated by Russia](https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html). Blacktivist regularly attacked America as racist and urged black users to rejected major candidates. On November 2, 2016, just before the 2016 election, Blacktivist\\'s Twitter [urged](https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html) Black Americans: \"Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it\\'s not a wasted vote.\"\\n\\n***Russia plays both sides -- on gender, race, and religion***\\n\\nThe brilliance of the Russian influence campaign is that it convinces Americans to attack each other, worsening both misandry and misogyny, mutual racial hatred, and extreme antisemitism and Islamophobia. In short, it\\'s not just an effort to boost the right wing; it\\'s an effort to radicalize everybody.\\n\\nRussia uses its trolling networks to\\xa0**aggressively attack men.**\\xa0 According to [MIT](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/), in 2019, the most popular Black-oriented Facebook page was the charmingly named \"**My Baby Daddy Aint Shit.\"**\\xa0 It regularly posts memes attacking Black men and government welfare workers.\\xa0 It serves two purposes:\\xa0 Make poor black women hate men, and goad black men into flame wars.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nMIT found that My Baby Daddy is [run by a large troll network](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/)\\xa0in Eastern Europe likely financed by Russia.\\n\\nBut Russian influence networks are also also aggressively misogynistic and aggressively anti-LGBT.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nOn January 23, 2017, just after the first Women\\'s March, the New York Times found that the Internet Research Agency began [a coordinated attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) on the movement.\\xa0 Per the Times:\\n\\n>More than 4,000 miles away, organizations linked to the Russian government had assigned teams to the Women’s March. At desks in bland offices in St. Petersburg, using models derived from advertising and public relations, copywriters were testing out social media messages critical of the Women’s March movement, adopting the personas of fictional Americans.  \\n>  \\n>**They posted as Black women critical of white feminism, conservative women who felt excluded, and men who mocked participants as hairy-legged whiners.**\\n\\nBut the Russian PR teams realized that one attack worked better than the rest:\\xa0 They accused its co-founder, Arab American Linda Sarsour, of being an antisemite.\\xa0 Over the next 18 months, at least 152 Russian accounts regularly attacked Sarsour.\\xa0 That may not seem like many accounts, but it worked:\\xa0 They drove the Women\\'s March movement into disarray and eventually crippled the organization.\\xa0\\n\\n**Russia doesn\\'t need a million accounts**, or even that many likes or upvotes.\\xa0 It just needs to get enough attention that actual Western users begin amplifying its content.\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\nA former federal prosecutor who investigated the Russian disinformation effort [summarized it like this](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html):\\n\\n>**It wasn’t exclusively about Trump and Clinton anymore.\\xa0 It was deeper and more sinister and more diffuse in its focus on exploiting divisions within society on any number of different levels.**\\n\\nAs the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) in 2022,\\xa0\\n\\n>There was a routine: Arriving for a shift, **\\\\[Russian disinformation\\\\] workers would scan news outlets on the ideological fringes, far left and far right, mining for extreme content that they could publish and amplify on the platforms, feeding extreme views into mainstream conversations.**\\n\\n**China is joining in with AI**\\n\\nLast month, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/media/chinese-influence-campaign-division-elections.html) on a new disinformation campaign.\\xa0 **\"Spamouflage\"** is an effort by China to divide Americans by combining AI with real images of the United States to exacerbate political and social tensions in the U.S.\\xa0 The goal appears to be to cause Americans to lose hope, by promoting exaggerated stories with fabricated photos about homeless violence and the risk of civil war.\\n\\nAs Ladislav Bittman, a former Czechoslovakian secret police operative, [explained](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) about Soviet disinformation, **the strategy is not to invent something totally fake.\\xa0 Rather, it is to act like an evil doctor who expertly diagnoses the patient’s vulnerabilities and exploits them, “prolongs his illness and speeds him to an early grave instead of curing him.”**\\n\\n**The influence networks are vastly more effective than platforms admit**\\n\\nRussia now runs its most sophisticated online influence efforts through a network called **Fabrika**.\\xa0 Fabrika\\'s operators [have bragged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/16/russia-disinformation-discord-leaked-documents/) that social media platforms catch **only 1%** of their fake accounts across YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and Telegram, and other platforms.\\n\\nBut how effective\\xa0are these efforts?\\xa0 By 2020, Facebook\\'s [most popular pages](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) for Christian and Black American content were run by Eastern European troll farms tied to the Kremlin. And Russia doesn\\'t just target angry Boomers on Facebook. Russian trolls are enormously active on Twitter. And, even, [on Reddit](https://www.thedailybeast.com/russians-used-reddit-and-tumblr-to-troll-the-2016-election).\\n\\n**It\\'s not just false facts**\\n\\nThe term \"disinformation\" undersells the problem.\\xa0 Because much of Russia\\'s social media activity is not trying to spread fake news.\\xa0 Instead, **the goal is to divide and conquer** by making Western audiences depressed and extreme.\\xa0\\n\\nSometimes, through brigading and trolling.\\xa0 Other times, by posting hyper-negative or extremist posts or opinions about the U.S. the West over and over, until readers assume that\\'s how most people feel.\\xa0 And sometimes, by using trolls to disrupt threads that advance Western unity.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nAs the RAND think tank [explained](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html), **the Russian strategy is volume and repetition, from numerous accounts,** to overwhelm real social media users and create the appearance that everyone disagrees with, or even hates, them.\\xa0 And it\\'s not just low-quality bots.\\xa0 Per RAND,\\n\\n>Russian propaganda is produced in incredibly large volumes and is broadcast or otherwise distributed via a large number of channels. ... **According to a former paid Russian Internet troll, the trolls are on duty 24 hours a day, in 12-hour shifts, and each has a daily quota of 135 posted comments of at least 200 characters.**\\n\\n**What this means for you**\\n\\nYou are being targeted by a sophisticated PR campaign meant to make you more resentful, bitter, and depressed.\\xa0 It\\'s not just disinformation; it\\'s also real-life human writers and advanced bot networks working hard to shift the conversation to the most negative and divisive topics and opinions.\\xa0\\n\\nIt\\'s why some topics seem to go from non-issues to constant controversy and discussion, with no clear reason, across social media platforms.\\xa0 And a lot of those trolls are actual, \"professional\" writers whose job is to sound real.\\xa0\\n\\n**So what can you do?**\\xa0 To quote *WarGames*:\\xa0 The only winning move is not to play.\\xa0 The reality is that **you cannot distinguish disinformation accounts from real social media users.**\\xa0 Unless you know whom you\\'re talking to, there is a genuine chance that the post, tweet, or comment you are reading is an attempt to manipulate you -- politically or emotionally.\\n\\nHere are some thoughts:\\n\\n* **Don\\'t accept facts from social media accounts you don\\'t know.**\\xa0 Russian, Chinese, and other manipulation efforts are not uniform.\\xa0 Some will make deranged claims, but others will tell half-truths.\\xa0 Or they\\'ll spin facts about a complicated subject, be it the war in Ukraine or loneliness in young men, to give you a warped view of reality and spread division in the West.\\xa0\\xa0\\n* **Resist groupthink.**\\xa0 A key element of manipulate networks is [volume](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/).\\xa0 People are naturally inclined to believe statements that have broad support.\\xa0 When a post gets 5,000 upvotes, it\\'s easy to think the crowd is right.\\xa0 But \"the crowd\" could be fake accounts, and even if they\\'re not, the brilliance of government manipulation campaigns is that they say things people are already predisposed to think.\\xa0 They\\'ll tell conservative audiences something misleading about a Democrat, or make up a lie about Republicans that catches fire on a liberal server or subreddit.\\n* **Don\\'t let social media warp your view of society.**\\xa0 This is harder than it seems, but you need to accept that the facts -- and the *opinions*\\xa0\\\\-- you see across social media are not reliable.\\xa0 If you want the news, do what everyone online says not to: look at serious, mainstream media.\\xa0 It is not always right.\\xa0 Sometimes, it screws up.\\xa0 But social media narratives are heavily manipulated by networks whose *job* is to ensure you are deceived, angry, and divided.\\n\\nEdited for typos and clarity.\\n\\n**P.S.
