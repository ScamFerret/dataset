Log In APPLY NOW Refer a friend and receive an extra 10% rewards per install. Let’s deal with the elephant in the room first. Helium Club will NEVER ask you for any payment information. No bank account details. No credit card numbers. No PayPal login. We will provide and install a Helium Hotspot in your home for free, and then pay you every month as a thank you for being a part of the Helium Network ​ In the interest of setting realistic expectations, our hosting service is not a “get-rich-quick” scheme, not everyone can have one, and it (probably) won’t make you a crypto millionaire over-night. So, with that out of the way, here’s how you could earn a passive monthly income with Helium Club… You provide us with some basic information about yourself and your property using our online application This will also generate your Personal Referral Link, but more on that later. We use online software to conduct a remote survey of your property and the surrounding area, including your proximity and line-of-sight to active Helium Hotspots. This may include a proof of residency check. We send you a link to our T&Cs, which you can electronically sign using your phone, tablet or computer. This digital document ensures that both parties are protected, and also allows us to book your installation date. We will call you to book a suitable time and date for our engineers to install your new Helium Hotspot. The hotspot is usually installed near your broadband router, with the antenna being fixed to the outside of your property. The hotspot will “mine” a crypto-currency called Helium (HNT) through a process called “Proof of Coverage” using LoRaWAN technology. This is an automatic process and does not require you to do anything. On the last Friday of every month, we pay you 15% of the HNT that has been mined by your Helium Hotspot. This is a completely passive income that requires no investment or action from you. Your 15% for being a host is just the beginning of your potential earnings. You will also have a Personal Referral Link. If anyone uses your link and has a Hotspot installed, we will pay you 10% of the Helium (HNT) mined from their hotspot, even if you don’t have one yourself. There is no cap on referrals. The more you refer, the more you get paid every month. Every day we connect to the Internet. But it’s not just people. Introducing the Helium Hotspot — a new wireless device that enables anyone to earn cryptocurrency by building a wireless network in their city and creating a more connected future.

Normally I just grab a beer, take a seat, enjoy the show and then go home. \\n\\nSo I agreed to check out the spot. I went inside, and took a seat. \\n\\nImmediately, two rather ugly women sat in either side of me, so I answered them before they asked. I told them sorry I’m not interested, I’m only here for a beer and I’m leaving.\\n\\nThey left. A few minutes later two others came and sat on either side of me. One of them was cute so I told her friend I don’t want to girls. One is fine. I repeated this multiple times because the girl kept saying “baby we do stuff together all the time”\\n\\nI gave up and said fine you can sit with me but again I don’t want anything.\\n\\nAfter little talk with the cute stripper, she tells me that she’s going to give me a dance. I refuse and she says don’t worry baby, welcome to Budapest!\\n\\nShe gives me a dance. \\n\\nShortly after, a short little man appears and gruffly asks me if I want a drink, I ordered a beer which I believe cost around 4$ USD. \\n\\nHe asked if I want to order anything for the girls, I said absolutely not. They kept pestering me and I agreed to get them another beer.\\n\\nTo my surprise, the little man returned with a majestic bottle of wine I never ordered.\\n\\nI assumed this was provided to the girls by the strip club as I certainly never ordered it.\\n\\nThe girls urge me to take a sip and I hesitantly agreed.\\n\\nEventually I felt like leaving and walked over to the counter to pay my bill.\\n\\nThe little man took out a calculator and tuned it around saying I owed what was the equivalent of 1000USD.\\n\\nIt dawned on me that I was in trouble, I argued that I didn’t order anything except the two beers which cost around 8USD. \\n\\nThe little man got very aggressive, he insulted me, threatened me and had two boneheads stand menacingly to my side while the two strippers kept yelling at me to pay. \\n\\nAt one point he threatened to call the police. When I called his bluff, he put his phone down.\\n\\nI offered to pay a maximum of 30k forin and he said I can shove them up my ass lol.\\n\\nAfter more arguing the little man who was the manager of the place smacked me with the menu.\\n\\nAs soon as he did so, I turned around and RAN as fast as I could, I could hear people running after me. I quickly pulled the door open and continued running, as he threw more insults and spat at my back. \\n\\nI’m quite fortunate that I didn’t pay them a dollar but yea, that was a really messed up experience.\\n\\nBe careful and never visit strip clubs in Budapest, I’m lucky I didn’t get beaten up, stabbed or mugged of my phone, watch and belongings. \\n\\nDo you think they would take the video of me and try to find me? The vibe I got was that this was managed by some mob', 'comments': ['I hate to break it to you, but this type of scam is not limited to Budapest. It’s common for over 30 years in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and other CEE countries.\\n\\nThe universal #1 rule is never to follow a random person (male, female, or not) into a bar you haven’t researched. The immediate red flag shouid have been for you that the strip club was empty and probably you were the only guest. \\n\\nPlease exercise caution next time.
