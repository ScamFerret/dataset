However, due to the currently active class action lawsuit against MyConstant, we will not be able to declare any further distribution until the matter is resolved. Thank you for your understanding. We are still able to process distributions to customers that have yet to claim their 1st (15 Feb 2023) and 2nd distribution (15 July 2023). Sincerely yours, Sep 20 2023 Clarification Regarding Discrepancies in 2021 1099 Form Interest Income Reporting This message is about questions we've received regarding errors in the way interest income was recorded on the 2021 Form 1099. Since November 2022, our system has been frozen, and our records have remained unchanged. The problem with the interest income figures on the form is due to a glitch in the website's front end, which we've identified as the main issue. After we received many emails about this issue, we quickly fixed the 1099 form to make sure it shows the right information, matching what we sent to the IRS. Please log in to your account and get the updated form. Jun 15 2023 Status of MyConstant Liquidation 1st Distribution $900,000 Developments & Updates Relating to Plan MyConstant funds are wrongly being held by custodian, Prime Trust. MyConstant has initiated an arbitration action against Prime Trust seeking more than $1,000,000. This was the amount we expected under the Plan to recover by June 2023 to fund the 2nd Distribution. While MyConstant hopes to reach a consensual resolution of this dispute, the Plan assumes any such recovery will not be available for distribution to Customers until 2024. The $1,500,000 in stable-coin & bitcoin maintained at CoinLoan, an Estonian-based lending platform.  Earlier this month, we received notice CoinLoan is insolvent and will be placed under the control of an administrator/trustee.  The notice indicated CoinLoan’s assets cover approximately 30% of its liabilities; so we have revised the projected recovery for these assets from $1.5 million to $400,000 (26%) which has the effect of reducing the estimated recovery rate under the Plan from 39.9% to 35.5%.  Also, because the insolvency proceeding will delay any recovery to CoinLoan account holders, we project any recovery toward the end of 2024. The Business Loan. MyConstant received a $500,000 prepayment of principal which, together with other Cash, is the source of funds for the 2nd Distribution. Mar 23 2023 As of 22 March 2023, we have distributed around $770,000 out of $1.1M planned for 1st distribution) to 851 customers (out of 5,574 customers). As you can see, we still have a significant number of customers (84.8% of total customers) that have not responded or reached out to us to update their information for distribution. Feb 24 2023 February 24, 2023 The first distribution is happening. After a week, there has been around $500,000 distributed to users. confirm your balance update your bank information hello@myconstant.com Thank you for being patient. To follow up on the previous update, we are unable to process crypto payments as expected because many users are unfamiliar with crypto and cannot provide a wallet. To add to the previous update, we would like to confirm that the distribution will be sent in USDC via the Ethereum network (ERC20). Here are some questions to help you better understand USDC: What is USDC? USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin pegged to the value of the US dollar. It was created to provide a digital alternative to traditional fiat currency, allowing for instant and secure transfer of value on blockchain networks like Ethereum. USDC is backed by actual US dollars held in reserve, ensuring a stable exchange rate of 1 USDC to 1 USD. USDC was created by the fintech company Circle and the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. These two companies joined forces in 2018 to launch the stablecoin and have since worked together to promote its widespread adoption. The USDC project is governed by the Centre consortium - an independent organization that governs the development and maintenance of the USDC stablecoin. The consortium is responsible for ensuring the stability and security of USDC and maintaining its 1:1 peg to the US dollar. Is USDC regulated? USDC is regulated as a stored value instrument (just like a pre-paid card). Stored value products are regulated under state money transmission laws. As the issuer of USDC, Circle is subject to oversight by 46 state regulators, which conduct frequent exams of Circle’s activities. Reserves are reported to the states pursuant to money transmission laws. Circle, and hence the reserve, is audited by Grant Thornton, a leading global accounting firm. Further, every month, Grant Thornton attests (i.e., verifies publicly) that the reserve balance equals the USDC in circulation. What are the assets backing USDC? The assets backing USDC are prescribed by the state regulators which provide companies like Circle a list of permissible investments in which the USD backing USDC can be invested. These are the same laws that protect the fiat money customers hold at Coinbase or Paypal. These laws are essentially customer protection laws, designed with the clear purpose of ensuring that the stored value is safe. Here are step-by-step instructions: How to create a Coinbase account How to receive crypto on Coinbase How to cash out your fund Payment methods for US customers Thank you for updating your information. We are implementing the steps to facilitate the 1st distribution as provided in the Plan and its Updates. Please provide your Wallet address as instructed so that you can be added to the whitelist and receive the distribution later. It should be noted that only whitelist addresses are eligible for withdrawal and it has to be an ERC20 wallet. The distribution is expected to happen no later than Feb, 15th 2023. Jan 06 2023 We want to keep you up to date on the latest happenings. Following the Customer Committee Meeting on December 28th, 2022, we are revising the plan and expect to schedule a meeting with them next week, along with the development of a new recovery plan. We will keep you informed as soon as possible. Dec 20 2022 December 20, 2022 We have received feedback from several Customers on the Plan sent out last time. Hence, Q&A attempts are necessary to address common questions we received as well as clarify a number of matters that may not be clear in the Plan. The Q&A has been sent to all users today. Please check your mailbox for further information. If you do not receive the email or need any further assistance, please contact us at Thank you for being patient in the meantime.
