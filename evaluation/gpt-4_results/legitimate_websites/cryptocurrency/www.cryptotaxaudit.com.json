During \"the merge\" all ETH holders were distributed ETHW tokens. What are the tax implications of this? From some reading I believe that forked tokens received are considered to be taxed as ordinary income based on fair market value at the time the recipient had \"dominion and control\" of the token. How on earth to calculate this?\\n\\n**Scenario 1:** Person has 1 ETH on a centralized exchange. During the Merge they receive 1 ETHW against their will, with no consent. Can they legally refuse the ownership of the ETHW token (because the value is small, and not worth the tax headache)?\\n\\nIf not.... how would one calculate the fair market value i.e. cost basis of the token? As it is a new token can it be argued the value and cost basis at the time of receipt was zero, so no ordinary income due, just a cost basis of zero to be used for future capital gains?\\n\\n**Scenario 2.** Person holds 1 ETH on a cold wallet. 1 ETHW is sent to their address. But the cold wallet software (e.g. Ledger) does not support ETHW, so to even see what they have \"received\" would require actively setting up 3rd party software e.g. Metamask, and they don\\'t want to do that.
