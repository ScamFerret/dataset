If you confront the scammers about being unable to withdraw the money, they may guilt trip you into paying more fees to do that, for example asking for money to pay \"taxes\" and offering to cover a part of your expenses.\\n\\nIf you manage to withdraw your money from the scam site, transferring it out of your compromised cryptocurrency wallet ensures that it is now out of reach of the scammers. Report the scammers to the platform and block them, but do not delete chat logs. The evidence has to be preserved for law enforcement. Law enforcement is often not qualified or motivated to recover your money, but if you are unable to get your money back, they are your only option. Even if they do not help you in the end, reporting the scam will at least alert them to the problem, keeping it on the radar.\\n\\nUnfortunately, no hacker online can get back what you\\'ve lost.
