However, it's important to remember that the absence of negative feedback on Reddit does not necessarily mean the website is legitimate. The previous observations, especially the discrepancy between the website's claim of being in business since 2015 and the recent domain registration, remain concerning. Given the evidence gathered through WHOIS information, SSL certificate details, and the content analysis, along with the lack of substantial negative feedback, I believe I have enough information to make an informed decision about the legitimacy of the website. I now know the final answer. The website https://nononsensefinancial.com/ appears to be suspicious due to the recent domain registration that conflicts with the website's claim of being in business since 2015, the use of privacy services to hide the identity of the domain owner, and the lack of substantial negative feedback which could indicate that the site has not been operational for a long time or that reviews are being managed. However, without more concrete evidence of fraudulent activity or user reports of scams, it is hard to definitively label this website as a scam.",
