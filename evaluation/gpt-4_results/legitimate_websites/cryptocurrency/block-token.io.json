This is because it is not a regulated market, and it is much easier to make money by scamming than by creating a real business. What about the other 100 tokens that are not scams?\\n\\n- of the remaining 100 tokens, 90 will fail in the first 3 months and other 5 will fail within the first 6 months, due to a bad business model, bad marketing, or a bad team without experience in business.\\n\\n- This leaves you only 5 tokens with which you could potentially earn big money.\\n\\nAt Urgaming, we have built a new Earn & Pump system, with which the main objective is that all profit generated within our ecosystem is re-invested in buying our URG Token and also adding more liquidity to the liquidity pool, thus increasing the market cap, the price of our token and the earnings of our holders.\\n\\nTo achieve this, we are creating our company, which will be the company in charge of developing our platform for gamers with which we will obtain great benefits within the market. These benefits, month by month, will be re-invested in buying our token as well as adding more liquidity to the liquidity pool to strengthen our token.\\n\\nImagine the following scenario: You bought 1 trillion URG tokens, and month after month, the company with its profits is buying URG tokens and adding more liquidity. This will make you win 3 times: first, with the 5% that is distributed to all holders, your tokens will increase, second, you will win by the constant increase in the price and market value of URG by the re-investment of the company's earnings each month and third, you will earn for the 2% of tokens that are burned from each transaction, accelerating more and more the increase of the value of our token.\\n\\nThe entire profit of the company will be used for this simple purpose: increase the price of URG and give more profit to the Holders. This means that by buying URG you are obtaining corporate profits from our company month after month, year after year.\\n\\nCurrently, our Market Cap is low, and for you to make a x100 or even a x1000 is not difficult, it is only a matter of time. This is the best time to invest big and be part of a token with real backing and business vision.\\n\\nAlso, for your safety, we have already been audited by Solidity, the team is Doxxed and full of business experience, liquidity has been blocked and the contract is rennounced. So ... Your funds are really Safu.\\n\\nThe Dev team are always available on Telegram so you can make inquiries, even if you send a private message to the Devs, they will answer you without problems. We work day and night for the benefit of all, as we have all gone through ups and downs in crypto and it is time for us to win.\\n\\nImportant Links:\\n\\nüëâüèªWebsite: https://www.urgaming.io/\\n\\nüëâüèªTG: https://t.me/UrGamingToken\\n\\nüëâüèªTwitter: https://twitter.com/UrGamingToken\\n\\nüëâüèªCMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/urgaming\\n\\nüëâüèªCG: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/urgaming\\n\\nüëâüèªBuy here: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xfaf9cc03c9855777fb56d02bc2bcb9d57e0755de\\n\\nBe part of the revolution, Welcome to UrGaming, the future is yours.\", 'comments': ['Be sure to do your own diligence.

This reduced Miners block rewards while enriching the pool owners directly. Most large Chinese mining pools along with 2miners and EZIL actively defrauded their miners, making many millions in secret. \\n\\nThis secret income was revealed by Micah, likely on behalf of the ETH Developers who were unhappy at seeing most mining pools stealing their miners incomes and funneling it into their own pockets. Most pools used a MEV company to do this, the most famous one being Archer DAO who supplied MEV income that was even lower than the gas that would have been on the block, causing a net loss overall but a net gain to the mining pools that usually only receive 1%. \\n\\nArcher DAO not only provided MEV, it allowed people to send ETH transactions at below gas cost, allowing pools to cheat their miners by hiding free transactions they are selling privately to others in their ‚Äú1 GWEI‚Äù payouts.\\nMost pools that were secretly defrauding their miners have now announced they are sharing MEV income. Most of them are lying about what percentage they share. \\n\\nA new scam has appeared that allows pools to advertise sharing MEV income, while secretly making a ton on the side. This is through a new token from Archer DAO called ‚ÄúEDEN‚Äù. Normally the top slots in blocks are sold either as MEV or for high tips. What EDEN does is it requires pools to reserve these slots for EDEN. EDEN doesn‚Äôt pay tips or MEV ETH for these slots (ETH that will go to miners), instead it pays its own ‚ÄúEDEN‚Äù token directly to a private hidden wallet owned by these pools. \\n\\nEDEN advertises that during the first 7 days it will pay 6,378,243 EDEN tokens to mining pools (Block Producers) per their white paper. https://edennetwork.io/EDEN_Network___Whitepaper___2021_07.pdf\\n\\nEDEN‚Äôs price varies but it‚Äôs currently priced at 3.60$ which works out to 22,961,674.80$ paid out to your mining pools secret wallets in just 7 days. A reminder that this is generally not extra income; this is space on your pool‚Äôs blocks that would normally pay you ETH through MEV and tips. Instead your pool collects 0 ETH for these and sells the space to EDEN. These pools steal ETH that goes to their miners turning it into EDEN for themselves. You can see pools claiming their EDEN rewards here https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ae0f92498346b9e011ed15d8c98142dcf62f774\\n\\nYou‚Äôll notice that most of them make sure to keep everything anonymous. However, there are some mistakes they make. HiveON Pool transferred 0.4 ETH in https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xd474d21d58caca907406c8c1a7219e62044249dc&amp;amp;p=2 for gas for the contract. They have swapped EDEN for ETH and are sitting on a cool 1300 ETH (4.1$ Million) here in their private wallet https://etherscan.io/address/0xd0fac1e4013ab69d6347fc0ecfc6604d05b848db\\n\\nNanopool has been obvious about it having transferred the ETH into their pool. That may indicate they are distributing the ETH they made from selling EDEN and if so then they appear to be the only pool doing so. https://etherscan.io/address/0x9c90bc6d0dd0f1ddcde0edf3b79037b50b36840b\\n\\nCruxpool is depositing it all into Binance. https://etherscan.io/address/0x0400dff7f40f10b23494687dbbb82104a788c979\\n\\nOther big pools are cheating their miners through EDEN but they‚Äôve hidden themselves well on EtherScan. The obvious ones on EDEN are Sparkpool, 2Miners, F2pool, Ezil and  Chinese pools. \\n\\nPools that are well known for scamming were forced to start sharing their secret MEV income. The best part is most of these pools advertise no fee on MEV when their actually making 100% and reducing their miners tips. Most pool comparisons will show these pools paying 20% less than the top pools due to their dishonesty and theft.\\n\\nMany will refuse to believe that their pools have been stealing from them for years to enrich themselves. Please do your own research and trust EtherScan. On ETH everything happens on chain. My single reddit post will get buried so please spread the word and don‚Äôt let these scammers who have stolen 100‚Äôs of millions from us get away.\\n\\n\\nEZIL demanded evidence and they‚Äôve done a good job hiding it, evidence is below and can be found by a simple google search:\\n\\n1. Eden Network has partnered with 2Miners and Ezil.\\n\\n2. ArcherDAO partnered with several smaller pools (2miners, Ezil, etc) to build and run in-house bots for them, splitting the profits 50/50.\\n\\nhttps://m.theblockbeats.com/en/news/25775\\n\\nhttps://dyor-crypto.fandom.com/wiki/Miner_Extractable_Value_(MEV)\\n\\nEZIL robbed their miners blind and should be ashamed. They make good money yet their dirty grubby hands have been greedy for more. They deserve to be locked in jail as the crooks they are.\\n\\nTo add more evidence https://app.edennetwork.io/fountain says the 7th block producer has produced 48 blocks in the past 14 hours while ezil if you count uncles has produced 48 blocks in the past 14 hours.', 'comments': ['Sparkpool: /u/Eth_SparkPool  \\n2Miners: /u/2miners  \\nF2Pool: /u/Harry-Ali  \\nEzil Pool: /u/ezil-me', '2miners, situation few days ago, i mined with them and decided to return to ethermine, so i apply for a payout, they payout less than their min allowance (0. 0043) and leave the rest on the pool (0.003), after emailing them for my few bucks they act like i should be happy to have gotten any at all.

This is because it is not a regulated market, and it is much easier to make money by scamming than by creating a real business. What about the other 100 tokens that are not scams?\\n\\n- of the remaining 100 tokens, 90 will fail in the first 3 months and other 5 will fail within the first 6 months, due to a bad business model, bad marketing, or a bad team without experience in business.\\n\\n- This leaves you only 5 tokens with which you could potentially earn big money.\\n\\nAt Urgaming, we have built a new Earn & Pump system, with which the main objective is that all profit generated within our ecosystem is re-invested in buying our URG Token and also adding more liquidity to the liquidity pool, thus increasing the market cap, the price of our token and the earnings of our holders.\\n\\nTo achieve this, we are creating our company, which will be the company in charge of developing our platform for gamers with which we will obtain great benefits within the market. These benefits, month by month, will be re-invested in buying our token as well as adding more liquidity to the liquidity pool to strengthen our token.\\n\\nImagine the following scenario: You bought 1 trillion URG tokens, and month after month, the company with its profits is buying URG tokens and adding more liquidity. This will make you win 3 times: first, with the 5% that is distributed to all holders, your tokens will increase, second, you will win by the constant increase in the price and market value of URG by the re-investment of the company's earnings each month and third, you will earn for the 2% of tokens that are burned from each transaction, accelerating more and more the increase of the value of our token.\\n\\nThe entire profit of the company will be used for this simple purpose: increase the price of URG and give more profit to the Holders. This means that by buying URG you are obtaining corporate profits from our company month after month, year after year.\\n\\nCurrently, our Market Cap is low, and for you to make a x100 or even a x1000 is not difficult, it is only a matter of time. This is the best time to invest big and be part of a token with real backing and business vision.\\n\\nAlso, for your safety, we have already been audited by Solidity, the team is Doxxed and full of business experience, liquidity has been blocked and the contract is rennounced. So ... Your funds are really Safu.\\n\\nThe Dev team are always available on Telegram so you can make inquiries, even if you send a private message to the Devs, they will answer you without problems. We work day and night for the benefit of all, as we have all gone through ups and downs in crypto and it is time for us to win.\\n\\nImportant Links: \\n\\nüëâüèªWebsite: https://www.urgaming.io/\\n\\nüëâüèªTG: https://t.me/UrGamingToken\\nüëâüèªTwitter: https://twitter.com/UrGamingToken\\n\\nüëâüèªCMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/urgaming\\n\\nüëâüèªCG: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/urgaming\\n\\nüëâüèªBuy here: https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xfaf9cc03c9855777fb56d02bc2bcb9d57e0755de\\n\\nBe part of the revolution, Welcome to UrGaming, the future is yours.\", 'comments': ['I agree!!', 'Great job', 'nice', 'Great', 'Good project :)']}]"
