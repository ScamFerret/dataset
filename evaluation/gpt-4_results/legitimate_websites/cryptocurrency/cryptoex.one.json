They are only 200km away from my location so I went ahead and visited them in person. I was greated by a helpful staff and shown different generations of miners live and running. While I was there I made a pre-order for 10 miners which arrived yesterday, properly sealed and on time. Hashrate is as described on the website and they really are quiet (as much as 10 machines can be). Highly recommended by me.
