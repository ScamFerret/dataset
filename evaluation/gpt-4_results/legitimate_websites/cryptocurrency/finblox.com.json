I'm so happy with the platform, it was surprisingly easy to get into crypto thanks to finblox. On top of that they regularly upload amazing content in their blogs and YouTube channel to keep all of its users updated. Overall it's an easy app to use, you get tons of benefits, and the company really cares to keep their users informed. 5/5! Christian Burgos Sep 12, 2022 Won in Pool Party! Cool feature! Won some cash for free! superzero Aug 29, 2022 Excellent, caring customer service. I made a mistake with a crypto tranfer. Customer service was quickly contacted by in app chat and Finblox made it right. Trustworthy company. Highly recommend. Howard Youngworth May 30, 2022 I really wanna say right to developers that Finblox is just amazing application. It has cool intuitive UI, that’s a huge problem of another apps. Also the deposit action is really clear for understanding as well. Thanks a lot 🙌 Alordead Apr 20, 2022 The App UX is very user friendly and easy to understand even for people new to cryptos. Current APYs are probably among the highest in the market right now. Before depositing I did my researches on the project and that’s why I decided to trust it. Had an issue with KYC which was resolved promptly in a day by Kamy from the customer support, very kind and professional. Can’t wait for Finblox do deliver even more. Ps: this is not a sponsored review! Gi.c.3 Jun 2, 2022 I love that you do the payouts every day and I love that on the top of the screen, you show people that they’re earning every day. I love that transparency. Ann Very easy to use app 👌. I can deposit my crypto (stablecoins) whenever to earn interest and withdraw to another exchange when I need the funds for trading. The interest is paid out daily. Both the deposit and withdrawl features are easy to use but can take a few hours for large amounts as they have to be approved manully by a team member. Also, the customer service is 10/10. I usually get a response from a team member within a few hours by using their built in chat service. Aj Sandhu As of now it's very helpful to me because I don't know how to trade so my crypto coin will get small interest even I'm not doing anything. Galiboy Very user-friendly. Everything is alright. I really like the security, the daily payouts and multichain. I want to put my funds where it’s insured. Because you never know. Tamas Very interesting and easy to understand. So far, Finblox has the best onboarding for me. Galuh Swipe for more testimonials! As featured by: Start your crypto journey today Sign up for Finblox and grow your crypto the smart way.
