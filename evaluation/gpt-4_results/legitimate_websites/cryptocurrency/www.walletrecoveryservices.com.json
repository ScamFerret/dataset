They are extremely thorough, while also being flexible in order to handle unusual requirements. Trust Should you trust us with your wallet? Why won’t we just steal your money? Good questions. If you send us your wallet, and we decrypt the password, then it would be possible for us to steal the money that the wallet holds (we won’t, but you can’t be sure of that). Our answer is that we run a sustainable business, which has been in operation continuously from 2013 through now (2022). We have helped customers numbering in the thousands, and pride ourselves on our honesty.

The text mentions that the service has been around since 2013, and there are testimonials and an FAQ section. The website also discusses trust and the potential concern about stealing funds, which they address by mentioning their longstanding operation and reputation. However, there are no clear signs of scam characteristics such as unusually low prices, claims of free money, targeting psychological weaknesses, or mentions of non-existent companies.
