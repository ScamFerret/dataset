Or, just leave them in the BC Vault and start stacking new sats on the MK4 (not all eggs in one basket).\\n\\nMy concerns with the BC Vault are:\\n1) Not open source\\n2) Not widely known - what happens if the company goes belly up - what if the app stops working - need support - etc.\\n\\nI also have a Trezor and a Ledger, but I've actually liked using the BC Vault the most and stuck with it.
