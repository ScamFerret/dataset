Example: Buy Bitcoin for $10 every day. Regular purchases Average price Should I wait for correction to start? The beauty of dollar-cost averaging is that you don't have to time the market. The green line on the chart is the average price of a person starting at the top. The dashed line is the average price of a person starting at the bottom. If the asset eventually goes up, whoever starts first always gets a lower average price. No need to time the market. Start anytime. Earlier = better average price Why is DCA better than a lump sum investment? In the short-term, the price may still go up, down, or sideways. Even if you're brave enough to go all-in, the lump sum wins only in the first scenario. DCA wins in two others. By acumulating more at the bottom, you get more of the asset. $10 = 1 $10 = 0.5 $20 $10 $5 Lump sum of $50 buys 5 coins DCA of $50 buys 6 coins Can I improve DCA with RSI or Mayer Multiple? Unfortunately, indicators like RSI can't outperform the market long-term. That would be too easy! The next signal to \"buy\" is often higher than the previous \"sell\". There is no simple formula that wins with DCA consistently. There are better things in life to focus on than trading.

You will need to use the desktop site because the mobile app doesnâ€™t have everything you need.\\n\\nOnce you are in coinbase pro, deposit the amount of money you want to DCA in for one month. You will have to deposit this every month.\\n\\nTwo websites that connect to coinbase pro are https://dcabot.online and https://deltabadger.com/\\n\\nDeltabadger is free up to $500 per year and dcabot is free unlimited. You can also tweak the settings so that dcabot places a limit order at 2-20% below the current price when you start DCAâ€™ing. So say you start on a Friday, DCA once a week, and the price is $10000 on Friday. If you choose 5% limit order, Dcabot will place an order at $95000.  If this order doesnâ€™t get filled before next Friday, it will be bought at the market price. It is worth noting that the owner of dcabot has stated that this program is still in beta so there could be some issues such as the buys not placing, however it has been working fine for me.\\n\\nTo use these websites, go to coinbase pro, click api, and generate and keep note of all the information, specifically the api secret and passphrase. Give the api key access to viewing and trading only. Then input these keys, secret, and passphrase into the websites above. These api keys will NOT be able to transfer your crypto, if youâ€™re worried about these websites scamming you and draining your account. You can actually make a separate portfolio and move usd from your main portfolio if you already hold money within your coinbase pro account and donâ€™t want to give the api access to that money. Then generate an api key for only that portfolio and you can move crypto that was DCAâ€™d back into your main portfolio so there is nothing to worry about.', 'comments': ['Tl;Dr use Coinbase Pro.', 'Great post. Curious if Gemini is similarly effective for DCA? I feel like the fees are pretty high on Gemini...', 'coinbase is great i my opinion :) had no troubles so far  \\nthere is even a free coin earn option to learn about the cryptos', 'My dream is to one day be able to use the Coinbase UI on Coinbase Pro....a man can dream, right?', '>Basically, the average person is going to be paying 5-10% in fees.\\n\\nI do not understand,  how can they be even average , if they can not even do some research and find they can pay 0.5% instead of 5% fee per transaction on the same site?
