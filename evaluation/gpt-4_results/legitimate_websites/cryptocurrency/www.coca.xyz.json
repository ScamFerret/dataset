Nor on what this means for **future** sales, market and company prospects.\\n\\nThis is not surprising, many investors are no longer interested in companies and their products at all, only in (minimal) daily profits, especially the short sellers who \"argue\" with \"arguments\" like \"*what* *a* *scam*\", \"*what* *a* *sh.. \"* and the like \"argue\" without ever substantiating this classification. Main thing to create a (negative) mood to get others to sell. Same in the opposite direction. There is daily speculation about takeovers or attempts to bring about a short squeeze based on certain percentages that a stock is sold short.\\n\\nBoth are wrong in the first place.\\n\\nHardly any investors still invest in products and companies, many are only \"gamblers\". At the same time, these players put products, companies and jobs at risk. For example, a good product cannot be developed and sold overnight. Nevertheless, these gamblers expect results in days or weeks and months at the most, and if they don\\'t come immediately, this is made out to be a problem. Even though everything within the company is on schedule. Even the development of an iPhone takes a year or more. More and more often you can read, especially with new products or companies, that the company has not made any sales or profits yet. How could it, if the product is still in development?\\n\\nIf that still doesn\\'t work, the killer argument will eventually be used. Competitor XYZ is already on the market and sells more. Or already has many partners. This was also the argument regarding Apple when Nokia was still the world market leader for mobile phones and smartphones and Apple presented the first iPhone. The outcome is well known. Or with Tesla vis-à-vis the established car manufacturers. Today, a Tesla drives away even a Porsche and Tesla is constantly building new factories. Porsche, on the other hand, is also doing well, but cannot keep up with Tesla\\'s expansion and is technically (e.g. in terms of range) lagging behind.\\n\\nWhat all of this has in common is that you can\\'t extrapolate from the past to the future. Otherwise, there would never be new market leaders. The future of a company lies in its current and future- oriented products, not in its old ones. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule, such as food manufacturers, like Coca-Cola, or banks, etc. Here, however, it should be about technical products and their manufacturers.\\n\\n**Summary: Ultimately, only the business outlook determines the future of a company and thus the share price. The business outlook depends on the current and future products.**\\n\\nThat is why short sales figures etc. are not considered here. Instead,it will be shown **why there is currently only one company in the field of  lidar sensors that meets all the requirements of large car manufacturers** such as Volkswagen, Toyota, etc. and where **a short squeeze could be triggered shortly due to their technical superiority**, since this technological superiority cannot be explained away or \"sold short\".\\n\\n**It should likely cause price reactions when a company is valued at only about 1/3 the market cap of inferior competitors on the stock market, as** **Microvision** **currently is relative to** [**Luminar.**](https://www.luminartech.com/) Both companies in September 2021 at the world\\'s largest motor show IAA in Munich:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohvcmi2v9vs71.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=6df79bd47d043efb1f2fb2810649e65becd691e0\\n\\nSources: private\\n\\nBecause in the field of lidar for self-driving cars (levels 3-5), the current \"official\" market leader is Luminar. \"Market leader\" mainly because of the market capitalization and the hype around the young company founder and CEO. Luminar has not sold any finished products yet. Last year, Luminar only sold about 100 development systems. I am not aware of numbers for 2021.\\n\\nThere is no car in the world that could be purchased with a Luminar lidar. This is already due to the fact that the company does not yet have a deliverable product.\\n\\nHowever, if the market leader has not yet managed to launch and sell a product for **self-driving cars**, it is not surprising that its competitors have not yet been able to generate sales in this area either.\\n\\n# Is lidar necessary?\\n\\nIt should not be discussed further that Mr. Musk as CEO of the company Tesla [considered ](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/)lidar systems [superfluous.](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/) First of all, this statement is already more than two years old (from mid-2019) and was quite correct at that time. when lidar systems were far too expensive (up to $100,000), far too big so they had to be mounted on car roofs and their resolution was simply too poor compared to cameras. But development continues and today the situation is very different.\\n\\nFor [his part, ](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html)an [IBM CEO had ](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html)also [estimated the worldwide demand for computers at only about five](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html) [(!) units.](https://www.pcworld.com/article/532605/worst_tech_predictions.html) This shows that even CEOs of global corporations can be wrong.\\n\\nThe [series of accidents with Tesla cars](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/) show that cameras alone are probably not able to guarantee a safe control of a car.\\n\\nIn addition, there are **far larger car** **companies** **that** **see lidar** **as** **indispensable.**\\n\\n# Market for Lidar Systems\\n\\nSo, it should be undeniable that there is a market for lidar systems. With about 70 million cars produced per year plus trucks\\\\*\\\\*,\\\\*\\\\* etc., there will soon be an **annual** **demand of** **50-300 million units** (usually several modules are needed per car, just as a Tesla has many cameras; at least one device each for the view to the front and one for the view to the rear), even if you exclude the Tesla cars.\\n\\n# Technology\\n\\nAfter the introduction to the topic, we will now look at the technology and **why** **it** **cannot** **be that** a **technologically** **highly superior** **company is** **only valued at a company value of** **only** **1/3** **of** **the** **technically** **far** **inferior** **\"market** **leader\"** and thus a **short** **squeeze** **should only be a matter** **of** **time,** since the true valuation very probably cannot be prevented for a long time.\\n\\nThis should occur at the latest when the first orders come in or when just enough investors realize that **something** **seems** **to** **be** **fundamentally wrong here**. Depending on what happens first. Both can happen on a daily basis.\\n\\nUpcoming orders can be considered almost certain due to the superior technology and the much earlier availability of the Microvision models.\\n\\nCar manufacturers are not interested in TV appearances by CEOs or fairytale up-and-coming stories; they want to build the best cars in their segment and for their target group.\\n\\n## General requirements of car manufacturers for car models\\n\\nAll car manufacturers in all target groups have the following essential requirements:\\n\\n* Security\\n* Design\\n* Vehicle characteristics (such as maximum speed, turning circle, etc.)\\n* Price\\n\\nDepending on the target group of a car model, these are of course weighted differently, so that no order can be given. Only safety should always be at the top of the list for all manufacturers.\\n\\nOf course, a Mercedes has to look better or different than a pick-up. But it doesn\\'t have to be as maneuverable and its load area can be smaller. However, it is no longer possible to sell ugly pick-ups today. While roof superstructures may not bother pick-ups, they are probably not acceptable for a Mercedes, Volkswagen or Toyota.\\n\\nIn terms of lidar systems, this means:\\n\\n* Security:\\n   * Highest possible resolution\\n   * Refresh rate must be high enough for short response times\\n   * non-dazzle\\n* Design: as invisible as possible\\n* Price: must match the selling price of the vehicle\\n\\n# System comparison\\n\\nSo, let\\'s compare the (only) system from the (previous) market leader Luminar with those from Microvision (four models in total).\\n\\nFirst of all, it is noticeable that Luminar intends to sell only one model with the product \"Iris\", while Microvision intends to offer three other models in addition to the top model and to cover other market segments with lower or specialized requirements.\\n\\nLuminar Iris and Microvision Lidar models:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f9zyviqx9vs71.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6562edb5efa03405f134e0b9f1a12cda136f3b2\\n\\nSource: [Luminar](https://www.luminartech.com/products/) and Microvision [Press Kit](https://www.microvision.com/about/press-kit/#brochure)\\n\\n## Security: Resolution\\n\\nThis is quite simple to understand.

Both Luminar and Microvision filmed the visitors on or in front of their booths. The environmental conditions were therefore almost identical.\\n\\nLuminar Iris Resolution:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tg5plnk8avs71.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=a844ff189410eb6e6f27df504d48af241d3b68ca\\n\\nSource: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg)\\n\\nIt is clearly visible that Luminar only shows single lines, while Microvision shows closed objects. No wonder with a twelvefold higher resolution.\\n\\n**This makes the score 1-0 in favor of Microvision over Luminar.**\\n\\nThis in the already most important category, because as already mentioned, the **resolution** **is** **the** **most** **important** **to** recognize as **many** **details** **as** **possible**, i.e. objects on and beside the road, which could be a danger for the car or others (e.g. small children or animals should not be run over).\\n\\n## Safety: refresh rate\\n\\nThe frame rate (Hz) is also very important. It indicates how many images a camera or lidar system delivers per second.\\n\\nFor example, if only one image per second is created, a car at a speed of 100 km/h has already covered a distance of 27.78 meters in that time. This corresponds to the length of about six cars. At a frame rate of 30, on the other hand, the car has covered less than one meter per frame. Thus, at 30 Hz, a passenger car has 30 times more decision-making power and (time) to react to something and can do so 30 times faster.\\n\\nLuminar and Microvision lidar systems each have up to 30 Hz.\\n\\nOn closer inspection, however, it is noticeable that Microvision systems always seem to have 30 Hz, Luminar Lidar lies in the range of 1-30 Hz. **This** **suggests** **that** **with higher** **frame** **rates** **at** **Luminar** **Iris** **the resolution decreases** while it remains the same at Microvision, so there are 30 images with the high resolution.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rrbo7qpaavs71.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee79cb5c0c56b977e8cb76d63d788fd369d0a60\\n\\nSource: Luminar Iris data sheet and [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021\\n\\nMicrovision thus seems to be significantly better here as well. However, since the details are not known what exactly 1-30 Hz means for Luminar, this category is not evaluated conclusively.\\n\\n## Safety: non-blinding\\n\\nEveryone knows it: If you look into the sun without sunglasses, you will be blinded and see less or almost nothing. The same applies to cameras, but also lidar systems. Here, glare protection is necessary. For people, sunglasses. With cameras and especially lidar systems it is technically much more complex.\\n\\nFor lidar systems there is even not only one sun, but several. **If** **there are** **several cars on a road** **within sight** **of a lidar** **system,** **which also have lidar** **systems,** **these** **lidar** **systems can dazzle each** **other**. This will almost always occur in the future if many cars are equipped with lidar systems.\\n\\n**In discussions about lidar companies, this problem gets little attention as far as I know.**\\n\\n**This** **is** **one of** **the main problems** **that** **lidar** **companies** **have to** **solve.** **Without a** **complete** **solution,** **a lidar system** **can hardly** **be used in** **a meaningful way,** **since it** **can be blinded and consequently** **temporarily** **be** **completely or** **partially** **blind - while** **the** **car continues** **to drive.**\\n\\nThis is because **lidar** **systems** **themselves** **emit** **light** **in the form** **of** **laser** **pulses** and wait to see whether it is reflected. If it is reflected, it will eventually return to the lidar system. The distance of the reflected object can then be determined from the duration, since the speed of light is both known and constant.\\n\\n**Lidar systems thus illuminate the environment in areas of light that are invisible to humans.**\\n\\nConsequence: **A** **lidar system** **may be dazzled from** **all** **sides,** **as if many laser** **pointers were directed** **at** **the lidar** **system**. So not only the own light comes back, but also foreign light.\\n\\nA lidar system must therefore ignore all extraneous light and filter out its own on the amount of light. It must not measure extraneous light under any circumstances.\\n\\n**This is a technically highly complex and difficult problem to solve.**\\n\\n**As** **far** **as** **the author** **knows,** **only Microvision has** **solved this** **problem completely**.\\n\\nThe company Luminar has recognized the problem after all and names it also officially, has however according to own representation on the Internet side no complete solution for it. But only a partial solution whereby this is not defined more precisely:\\n\\n>*limited* *interference*\\n\\nSources: [Luminar](https://www.luminartech.com/sensory-overload-making-sense-of-lidar/) and [Microvision.](https://twitter.com/MicroVision/status/1438633835395043328)\\n\\nHowever, Microvision clearly states that the lidar systems **are** **completely** **immune** **to light** **from** **other** **lidar systems** **and the sun** as show below from the  [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021.\\n\\nVideo content from the [youtube video \"Interference Immunity\":](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK3t8zFcl3I) Microvision\\'s description to the video states complete immunity to other lidar systems (\"free\"):\\n\\n>*MicroVision\\'s* *Interference* *Immunity* *video* *released at* *IAA 2021.* *MicroVision\\'s* *lidar* *sensor* *will* *work* *across* *all* *ambient* *lighting and* *is* ***free of*** ***interference*** ***from*** ***other*** ***lidars***.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ofddo1yfavs71.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=54bbf160e6809097d7ba571c762c8fe1de522736\\n\\nSource: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK3t8zFcl3I)\\n\\nAccording to Microvision, it has adopted a solution that Microvision has already developed for the HoloLens 2 from Microsoft and which is also used there. This is probably also patented.\\n\\n**A** **lidar** **system** **like Luminar\\'s, which is** **only** **partially immune to other lidar systems** **and sunlight,** **is** **simply too dangerous** and can be blinded or even provide false information, endangering lives.\\n\\nThis point goes clearly to Microvision. **The** **score** **is** **therefore** **2:0**.\\n\\nOther competitors also don\\'t seem to have solved this hugely important problem yet. Innoviz has only considered sunlight even with InnovizTwo. Also Blickfeld has not solved the problem, but only for sunlight. This seems to apply to all competitors This would make Microvision the only company whose lidar systems are completely immune to light from other lidar systems. For comparison:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uapg5lvhavs71.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&s=b00c07cb7060c57d513a3cdd602a83c9c054f493\\n\\nSource: [InnovizTwo](https://innoviz.tech/innoviztwo) and Blickfeld  [Vision Plus](https://www.blickfeld.com/products/vision-plus/) and [MicroVision](https://www.microvision.com/)\\n\\n## Practicability\\n\\nThe author still knows the Walkman from Sony. For the younger ones: These were cassette recorders that could play music that was recorded on magnetic tapes. This tape had to be moved and that was done by a belt drive. The belt drive (and not a direct drive) was used to soften vibrations. This technology from the 80s of the last century is used by Luminar as a drive in Luminar Iris as shown in a patent drawing below (top picture is the inside of a Sony Walkman):\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3j0qvprlavs71.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=77c5f396e319e9fcacf24738dbb41d291227e956\\n\\nSource: [Walkman](https://blog.fh-kaernten.at/ingmarsretro/tag/walkman-en/?lang=en) and Luminar patent drawing.\\n\\nThe reason is simple: Luminar, like Sony back then, also wants to avoid vibrations being transmitted to the shaft.\\n\\nHowever, the author doubts that the Luminar Lidar system Iris will survive everyday car use for years without repairs. Belts wear out, become brittle and even the slightest changes in length etc. will render the systems unusable and result in high repair costs for the car owner.\\n\\nThe other moving parts such as shafts will also wear out. The slightest changes will also render the system unusable, since a laser beam has to be controlled, which requires the highest precision. With Sony Walkman, the music didn\\'t sound as good then. With Luminar, the system will fail immediately. After all,cars have a lifespan of ten to twenty years.\\n\\nAlmost all of Luminar\\'s competitors do not have this problem. Since they, including Microvision, do not use any moving parts in their systems, at least in the new models. **Microvision has** **chosen the** **right** **architecture** **with** **Solid State,** **which has long** **proven its** **suitability for** **everyday** **use** **in the** **Microsoft** **HoloLens 2** **and** **the further** **development** **IVAS** **for** **the US** **Army,** even under the most difficult conditions that regularly occur in the military.\\n\\n## Design\\n\\n## However, a safe car is of no use if no one buys it.\\n\\nSince design is very important in all areas of life, from smartphones to cars, and is at least one of the deciding factors in a purchase decision, if not the deciding factor, no car manufacturer can afford to install ugly lidar systems, such as those used to be installed on the roof or as attachments in the front, etc.\\n\\nWhile Microvision plans to install its lidar system where the interior rearview mirror is located, Luminar wants to install the Iris model on the roof in a bulge in the roof.\\n\\nSuggestions from Luminar for the installation of \"Iris\":\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9tke334oavs71.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=3056f40517caa747eef938b3296b34542a166031\\n\\nSource: [Luminar](https://www.luminartech.com/products/) and [Luminar Press](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210902005531/en/)\\n\\nInstallation suggestion from Microvision:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z88ttqnpavs71.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d91a68b90a6a94bcd1c514f28bef582b8c394c3\\n\\nSource: [Microvision youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwiI1-rSgq0)\\n\\n**This is where the mechanical-optical internal design of Luminar Iris takes its toll, resulting in a lidar system that is many times larger than Microvision\\'s chip-based lidar system, which has no mechanical parts.**\\n\\nThe dimensions of Luminar Iris are according to the official Luminar data sheet:\\n\\nSource: Luminar Iris data sheet\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a1y8z28savs71.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=59e7afcc36a3b037aa1983bf0834f3d1b29977e7\\n\\nThus, Luminar Iris without holders has a volume of: 27 cm \\\\* 5,4 cm \\\\* 10,6 cm = 1\\\\*\\\\*.545,48 ccm\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nThe A-sample from Microvision has a size of approx.\\n\\n20 cm \\\\* 11 cm \\\\* 3,4 cm = 748 ccm\\n\\n**It should be noted that** **the** **data from** **Luminar** **are** **the final** **dimensions,** **while** **Microvision has** **only** **measured a prototype**, the size of which could be **halved in** the final product to **about 350 ccm**, as Microvision told visitors at the IAA.\\n\\nThe Microvision Lidar has therefore already as prototype only half the volume and like Luminar Iris and final, optimized product probably less than 1/5 of the size of Luminar Iris.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/melakyktavs71.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=74c1a9f37bf62d3afb11ac4d6eb0c21e1d0a7672\\n\\nSource: [reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/ppqpc4/i_found_a_way_to_measure_the_asample/) and [Microvision](https://twitter.com/MicroVision/status/1436488111610073112/photo/)\\n\\nVery important for car manufacturers to know: While **Luminar** **Iris is** **wide and tall**, the **Microvision** **Lidar** **system** **is** **narrow** **and** **flat**.\\n\\nOnly this design allows the seamless integration into car designs.\\n\\nFrom this author\\'s point of view, the **size and shape of** **Microvision\\'s lidar system** is **a knockout** **criterion for** **all car** **manufacturers who don\\'t** **want to** **disfigure their** **car** **design**.\\n\\nIn addition, self-driving cars **require at** **least** **two** **lidar** **systems**, one for the view to the front and one for the view to the rear. The roof would therefore have to be bulged out at the front and rear to accommodate the Luminar lidar systems.\\n\\nMicrovision lidar is both very thin and very narrow, while Luminar lidar is relatively thick and very wide. Car designers needed thin and narrow lidar systems.\\n\\n**This** **point** **also goes** **clearly to Microvision,** **so the** **score** **is** **already 3:0.**\\n\\n## Price\\n\\n## Development costs\\n\\nBy its nature, **a price of a** **component** **strongly** **depends** **on the number** **of** **pieces**. This is because a price is made up of several components. They are the fixed costs, the cost of materials and manufacturing costs (and service, recycling costs etc.)\\n\\nThe fixed costs are, for example, the costs of development but also the other general costs that a company has and that are attributable to the product. They become lower per unit the higher the number of units. Development costs of 1 million dollars mean that products sold in quantity 1 must cost at least 1 million dollars. However, if the product is sold in a million units, the price of a unit is only at least $1.\\n\\nDevelopment costs incurred:\\n\\n* Luminar: All expenses in the last ten years, as the company has only developed one product so far: **Accumulated deficit: $697,254,000** (Source: [Luminar Q2 2021 Results](https://www.luminartech.com/luminar-reports-q2-2021-results-and-business-update/))\\n* Microvision: Operating costs for approximately two years, as development did not begin until early 2020 and company previously developed and sold other products (such as a projector for Sony, Sharp, Ragenthek; interactive projector, consumer lidar, projectors for HoloLens 2). Here, we can assume roughly **$50 million**, as Microvision\\'s operating costs are about $25 million per year (Source: [Q2 2021](https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/9856/q2-2021-financial-and-operating-results-call)).\\n\\n**This makes the development costs to be allocated to the final prices about $800 million for Luminar by the start of production in late 2022 and only about $50 million for Microvision.**\\n\\n**This** **means** **that** **the development** **costs** **for** **Luminar\\'s** **lidar** **systems** **are approximately 16** **times** **those for** **Microvision**. Of course, this has to be taken into account in the pricing.\\n\\n## Production costs\\n\\nHowever, the development costs do not yet constitute a product. The material costs in particular must be taken into account here. As a rule of thumb: The more expensive a material is and the more material is needed, the more expensive a product will be. A watch made of gold is more expensive than one made of steel. In the same way, a car is more expensive than a bicycle because it requires much more material (and for other reasons).\\n\\nBoth the amount of material needed and the manufacturing costs should be much lower for Microvision. While the Luminar Lidar consists of solid aluminum blocks, Microvision probably only needs a plastic housing.\\n\\nIn addition, Luminar has many mechanical components, whereas Microvision uses a chip-sized MEMS module and does not use any mechanical components and therefore does not have to manufacture any mechanical components:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vot84xlwavs71.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=b35494daae11f904f94fb6af9507034fd6949852\\n\\nSources: Luminar patent application and [Microvision](https://ir.microvision.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/333/microvision-announces-completion-of-its-long-range-lidar)\\n\\nIt is interesting that Luminar never shows the internal structure of Iris. Luminar always shows only empty cases.\\n\\nMicrovision, on the other hand, can use inexpensive plastic because Microvision does not use moving parts.\\n\\nThe mechanical components in the Luminar Lidar are not likely to be cheap to produce either, but they are much cheaper than the production of the many mechanical components, as **Luminar** **requires** **many machines** **such as** **lathes** **and milling machines** **for** **this,** **on** **which they** **have to be** **turned and milled to extremely low** **tolerances,** **for** **example**.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yfru9myavs71.png?width=1004&format=png&auto=webp&s=51af8afc223c5a69e3f57824ddd6eb1eff4472bc\\n\\nSources: Luminar [Q1 Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_KGdSMOZdc&feature=emb_logo) and [Q2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxmSsHsaDKc)\\n\\nPlease watch these videos, how complex the production of the Luminar Lidar is, while Microvision (see photo above) only has to assemble printed circuit boards, connect them and insert them into a housing. These differences are the reason why Luminar Lidar- System will never be able to produce as cheap as Microvision:\\n\\n* [The Path to Series Production: Q1 Update - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_KGdSMOZdc&feature=emb_logo)\\n* [The Path to Series Production: Q2 Update - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxmSsHsaDKc&t=118s)\\n\\nThat\\'s also why it takes Luminar two years just to set up production, while Microvision has developed a completely new system and can produce it in that time. Above is also Luminar\\'s schedule (from [The Path to Series Production: Q1 Update - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_KGdSMOZdc&feature=emb_logo)).\\n\\nCosts increase in manufacturing the lower the tolerances have to be. The lower the tolerances that have to be maintained during production, the more expensive they are. The **costs** **do not** **increase linearly,** **but** **rather** **exponentially**.\\n\\nIt goes without saying that only very low tolerances can be permitted here for the control of a laser beam, which certainly go to the limits of what is feasible.\\n\\nThis means that the **manufacturing costs** are certainly **many** **times** **higher** **than those of** **Microvision** due\\n\\n* to the high-precision machines\\n* very precise tools required\\n* **Luminar** **lidar** **consists** **of** **many more individual** **parts** **and**\\n* significantly higher costs for quality assurance and testing.\\n\\n**Luminar ends up doing what Microvision does on a chip basis (MEMS), controlling a laser beam, the old-fashioned way via mechanical components like shafts and a belt drive. See patent drawing before.**\\n\\nThe result is not only a much larger device, much poorer resolution due to the limitations of the Luminar concept (e.g. moving masses, inertia, etc.) but also much higher cost to manufacture simply due to the large number of components.\\n\\n**Luminar** **thus** **undoubtedly** **needs** **significantly more** **material,** **more machinery** **and more personnel** **to produce a lidar** **system,** since **more** **steps** **are** **required** due to the large number of mechanical parts **and** **a high degree of** **automation does** **not** **seem** **possible**.\\n\\nThe Microvision Lidar can be assembled on almost any (automated) assembly line for smartphones or computers, since it consists of nothing more than a housing, computer chips and circuit boards, just like any smartphone, notebook or computer.\\n\\n**It** **can therefore be assumed that** **Luminar** **Iris** **is** **significantly more expensive to** **manufacture than** **Microvision Lidar.**\\n\\n# Scalability\\n\\nSince Microvision apparently does not have **any moving** **mechanical parts** to finish and therefore **does** **not** need any **special machines,** but will be able to use virtually any production line for smartphones or computers, there are not **only the correspondingly** **high** **costs** **for** **their** **own** **factories** **as** **Luminar** **needs** **them** and is also currently creating, but the **scalability and thus** **the** **deliverability is** **significantly** **higher**.\\n\\nSmartphones are now manufactured in quantities of hundreds of millions per year. Computers in similar orders of magnitude. **Consequently,** **it** **should** **not** **be difficult for Microvision to produce** **almost** **any number** **of** **units** **required if a** **mass** **producer** **such as** **Foxconn** **is** **commissioned**.\\n\\n## Development status\\n\\nWhile Luminar is still testing the stopping in front of a dummy on a short test section at low speed according to the last published videos, Microvision has already a company specialized in such tests with its own employees to test on a company-owned test track at high speeds. The following presentation of Luminar shows the current progress:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mqwdx104bvs71.png?width=1004&format=png&auto=webp&s=92846410179dea0eb0bc08fd5b4ced10c25eb6ca\\n\\nSources: Luminar and [Microvision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlG222Ybyvg)\\n\\n# Customers and partners\\n\\nA distinction must be made between customers (= companies that actually buy larger quantities of the products) and partners (= companies with whom contacts exist, e.g. for development, testing, etc., but who do not buy much or anything).\\n\\n## Customers\\n\\nLuminar does not have any known customers who purchase larger quantities for their end products. In fact, Luminar has not published any order intake to date.\\n\\nFor Microvision, the same is true for its Lidar division. In the other business areas, however, Microvision has already achieved sales in the double-digit million-dollar range, almost exclusively with Tier 1 companies, such as Sony, Sharp, Microsoft:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7r7q9v5bvs71.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=36ca1c73db45b5f88b741d517768a6acbae816e0\\n\\nSource: [Microvision](https://www.microvision.com/) October 2021 and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/buy)\\n\\nUnlike Luminar, Microvision is recognized as a supplier by market-leading companies and has already demonstrated the ability to deliver products of the required quality in high volume that are e.g. in use by the US Army through the Microsoft IVAS.\\n\\n## Partners\\n\\nThis refers to companies that have some kind of agreement for something.\\n\\nLuminar lists many partners who do pay for development systems and services.\\n\\nMicrovision is run by techies who shun publicity.

This is where his experience and qualification pays off which the Luminar CEO does not have.\\n\\n**His** **personal** **commitment** **and enthusiasm for** **success** **should also** **be** **emphasized**. While the Luminar CEO only appeared at the IAA in Munich for photo opportunities, the Microvision CEO was on site every day to meet with customers.\\n\\n# Potential gains in lidar division for Microvision\\n\\nApproximately 70 million passenger cars are produced worldwide every year. In addition, there are trucks, etc.\\n\\nAs stated, 2-4 lidar systems are needed for cars, which **would** **correspond to** an **annual** **number** **of** **about** **150-300** **million units**.\\n\\n**If Microvision could achieve just 10% share, thus selling 15-30 million units per year, that would equate to $750 million to $1.5 billion in annual profits at just $50 earnings per unit.**\\n\\n**At a very conservative P/E of 10, the market cap would then have to be $7.5 billion to $15 billion. That would equate to a share price of about $50-$100.**\\n\\nMicrovision is thus undervalued not only relative to Luminar, but also relative to the expected gutters in the next few years. The author also assumes that Microvision will achieve a significantly higher market share than only 10%.\\n\\n**The current Luminar stock price of about $15 is equivalent to a Microvision stock price of $30, since Luminar has issued almost exactly twice as many shares as Microvision.**\\n\\nPrecise forecasts (volumen, profit margin) are difficult. However, it can be assumed that - as with airbags - **lidar systems will soon be installed in almost all cars by few suppliers.** The market will likely consolidate quickly - because of Microvision\\'s technical superiority with Microvision at the top.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nConclusion remains: **Luminar** **has** **no future** **as** **a** **lidar** **manufacturer** **due to** **its** **already** **fundamentally** **outdated and non-performing** **hardware base**. At least not with large car manufacturers. Luminar could only specialize in software.\\n\\n**Microvision, on the other hand, has the best chance in the market for lidar systems for self-driving cars because of its technically superior hardware base that has been proven in mass-market products such as the Microsoft HoloLens 2.**\\n\\nMicrovision is also very much at an advantage, as mass production will start as early as this year, while Luminar is not scheduled to start until late 2022.\\n\\nIn addition, the **excellent,** **efficient** **and highly** **qualified management** **and development** **team** is certainly **superior** **to** **Luminar**. It has developed the Microvision Lidar from scratch to production readiness in only two years, while the Luminar team needs two years longer.\\n\\n**Therefore, it is only a matter of (probably short time) that Microvision receives the first orders from large automotive companies like Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW etc. This makes short selling of shares very risky.**\\n\\n**Orders can come** **in daily.** **Also, at** **some point** **stock** **buyers** **may recognize** **the massive undervaluation of** **Microvision** **stock** **in** **comparison to Luminar** **and at** **the same time initiate a short** **squeeze,** **which could** **lead to** **a price of** **$60 per** Microvision share. **$30 per Microvision share currently corresponds to the market capitalization of Luminar**.\\n\\nWhat has also gone completely **unnoticed** in the discussion is that **Microvision Lidar** **is** **probably the** **only** **system** **in the world that is fully immune to light** **from** **other** **lidar** **systems**.\\n\\n**Other manufacturers specify this only for sunlight as discussed before.**\\n\\n**However, this is one of the most important features for lidar systems to meet. Microvision also proved this as the only company at the IAA by having two lidar systems facing each other.**\\n\\nMany cars constantly encounter each other at the same time, on roads, in parking lots, etc. When they dazzle each other, accidents are inevitable. That\\'s why Microvision is probably the only company, which shows this in a video. **The others** **just** **can\\'t** **do it as far as known.**\\n\\n**This** **technological** **breakthrough**\\\\*\\\\*,\\\\*\\\\* **which has** **so far** **been completely** **disregarded in the** **valuation of** **the stock,** **is** **a** **very big** **competitive advantage** \\\\- along with the others such as resolution, form factor, etc.\\n\\nThat\\'s why here is the link to the Microvision video again. **This** **technology** **alone** **could make an** **advantage of** **billions** **of** **dollars** **in profits** **and make Microvision the** **market** **leader**:\\n\\nVideo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK3t8zFcl3I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK3t8zFcl3I)\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bhawv9b8bvs71.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0c0a3e063d27f476b80f59bb645b2e446b2f0ad\\n\\n# Other business areas\\n\\nNot included in this analysis are the other business areas.

USD 20,000 that I am dedicating to my travels to be exact. You\\'d be surprised how much this amount of money can do in some parts of the world! The main thing is that while traveling I do not have other expenses that people normally would have \"back home\": house rent, car, petrol, gas, electricity, phone and internet bills, etc.. Without all this monthly payments, I can afford to travel. In some places, we actually spend less per month than we would spend in our normal lives. Just today, I had lunch (soup+main dish+coffee) in Ecuador for USD2. How cool is that?! :D.\\n[I\\'ve been thinking about doing the same, actually. There\\'s just one thing that bothers me: where do you keep the money? Is in in your bank account and you just withdraw some cash when you need it? Do you have a backup plan if you lose your bank card?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4btcuq?context=5)|I don\\'t keep the money with myself. It\\'s in a bank account and I just carry credit and debit card. My boyfriend also has his cards so if something happens we hope it only happens to one of us and have the other person\\'s cards as back-up. We just withdraw from the ATM when we need. Imagine if we are that unlucky and both get robbed, then I guess we would seek help in our respective Embassies and ask family to send us money via western union or so, until we get new cards issued.\\n[Also, that video on your main page, was it filmed with GoPro?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4btcuq?context=5)|The video on the mainpage has images of different cameras: an old Sony handycam, my new Sony HXR-MC50U, ripped images out of our skydiving DVD and also the GoPro.\\n[How long have you budgeted the 20k to last?   in my experience that is about 12 months.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bwe77?context=5)|We\\'ve been traveling for 7 months and spent almost half of it. But that is also taking into consideration that we went to Brazil on the most expensive time of the year, Carnival, and spent 5 x what we spent in a month in Mexico or here in Ecuador. So, averaging things out I think this could go up to a year and a half, keeping expenses under control. If we are short on money and still want to travel, we\\'ll make a move to SEA. Money will go a much longer way there than here in Latin America!\\n[You amaze me.  Where did you work before, that you could just set aside $20k for traveling?  You are living my dream.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bsrbk?context=5)|I used to work in Dubai as production manager for TV commercials.

We\\'ve spent less than you per person since November and that considering we spent Carnival in Brazil which was extremely expensive. So avoiding extras life that, we\\'re pretty damn good so far.\\n |We book flights that have free cancellation and refund 100% of the amounts. Have to search specific airlines for each place, but so far we\\'ve managed to make it work without loosing any money.

It\\'s such a unique country! Love the food, such friendly people, so many colorful traditions... a lot of character, basically.\\n |In terms of advice, for anyone traveling long term I would say to go slow. If you move locations every 2 days you are likely to get tired too quick (which would be a waste!) and, also, if you see way too much at once, you \"take\" less of each place. Move at a moderate pace and allow yourself to absorve the goodness of each place you visit. Also, for budget travelers like me, I would say not to stay in the crappiest places just because they are the cheapest. There is no point in traveling if you are going to spend the nights in depressing places that don\\'t make you feel good. I rather spend a little bit more money (we\\'re talking a few $ here) and feel good where I stay, put my belongings, etc..\\n[I have been living and traveling abroad for ten years now.

We have crossed from country to country by plane always. Traveled by bus internanally on each country while here in South America. Only exception was Brazil, were we did take a couple of national (expensive) flights as distances were rather big. \\n[Interanally? go on...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bqq79?context=5)|Meany!!\\n[Country to country plane flights???

Welcome to the world of travelers, then! ;)\\n |We have a rough itiinerary. We traveled a bit in Asia, Middle East, Europe and Africa but right now, since we\\'ve started the website and all, we\\'re dedicating some time to Latin America. The initial plan was to go from Mexico, all the way to Argentina (Patagonia). The order of countries we go through is work-in-progress. But we do plan with a bit of time in advance to apply for visas, it\\'s not like \"tomorrow we\\'re going to...\" Also, the more flexible we are the better flight deals we tend to score. And flights are surprisingly expensive between South American countries. Visas are a thing to take into consideration though: most travelers/backpackers we see are from western countries (USA, Canada, Europe and Australia mainly) and get visa on arrival. I got visa on arrival myself to all countries we\\'ve been to so far in Latin America. But the same doesn\\'t apply to my boyfriend with Indian passport. Just to tell people who get visa on arrival: VALUE YOUR GODDAMN VISA ON ARRIVAL. Really, you don\\'t know the assle that sometimes is to apply for visas when you are not in your own country of residence! Should really value this shit!!\\n |We\\'ve been travelling since last September and almost spent 50% of our budget. We can go at least for another 8 months or so I\\'d say, depending on the countries we visit. For example, we\\'ve spend a month in Ecuador and spent USD900 each. But we went to Brazil during Carnival (highest season of them all!) and spent RIDICULOUS amounts of money. That really took a chunk of our budget *hurts*\\n |Eventually, we would like to monetize our website to help out with travel expenses, or score some freebies along the way in return of exposure on the website (reviews of hostels, videos of tours, etc). In some cases, if we don\\'t earn money at least would be nice not to spend it!\\n |No setbacks so far, really. We had a pretty ugly story in Brazil when we got robbed and my friend got punched and was bleeding all over the place and we couldn\\'t find a first aid place to get him stitched.

Getting visas isn\\'t normally that difficult (never got a NO for no country, neither in Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America or US). But applying is a hassle and sometimes it\\'s costly. For example now that we are traveling around Latin America, we didn\\'t even consider going to Belize because their tourist visa for Indians costs $250. What\\'s worse?! It costs $4000 for Chinese citizens. How fucking racist is this?!?\\n |The main issue is that when you try to apply for a country somewhere, they will always tell you that you must apply in your country of origin or residence. Then you try to explain that you are traveling long term so that is impossible. Even if you would have applied to ALL visas necessary for your travels before departure, some visas have validity and you must enter the country within a certain number of days of the visa issue, so this would be impossible. The Consulate of Peru in Quito, Ecuador, has been very unflexible with this. So far no luck. But every other place we managed to work it out somehow.\\n |About the cheapest countries to visit from India, here\\'s what he replied a little ago: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bqfw)  \\n[Thank you. Yeah, wish it was easier to travel around the world. And i wish the Indian rupee fares better, right now international travel is just too expensive.

If so, then start within India itself. There is so much to do... is one huge and culturally super rich country! So many people from abroad include India in their favorite travel destinations... must be for a reson! :)\\n[Yes, i live in India. Agreed, there is so much to do here.

And worst?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bqqzx?context=5)|I can\\'t really pick a best experience. We\\'ve been to such different countries and all of them have something different and special for me. At the top of my head, one of the highlights of my trip in Latin America, has been to meet a Mexican friend of mine that I had studied with in Spain 9 years ago. Was a beautiful reencounter. It felt like time hadn\\'t passed by and had a local guide, so that was awesome! ;)\\n |Also, one of the greatest feelings of my traveling life was taking a plane from Dubai to Addis Ababa, in Ethiopia. This was when we took off for good from Dubai - the relief and exitement I felt that day was only a good sign for all the good moments we were about to live ahead!\\n |The worst was definetly [getting robbed in Brazil](http://bkpk.me/salvador-da-bahia-a-carnaval-tale-with-a-not-so-happy-ending/). I was silly enough to take my video camera out during Carnival in Salvador da Bahia. Got robbed by like 10 kids and the worst part is that they hit me, pulled my dressed and I was half naked in the middle of the streets.. and my friend got hurt pretty bad. Ended up the night in hospital getting him stitched. Was feeling hopeless for 2 days after that.. but then got back on track!\\n[Best food?  If you had to pick one of the countries that you had visited to retire to which one would it be?  Any really interesting activities or traditions that you specifically want to see in a country.  (Diving with Great Whites in South Africa or Oktoberfest in Germany for example) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bqtrz?context=5)|Best food: Mexican. I also love Chinese but haven\\'t been to China yet, so I can\\'t tell how good it would be there. Noodle soups in Singapore were yummy. Best raw ingredients (fruits and veggies) are for sure in Latin America. Veggies in Costa Rica tasted great (mostly organic, I believe) and fresh fruit juices in Brazil were delicious.  To retire I would maybe go to a beach-side place in Mexico. Or in Thailand. Oh... and Goa in India! Yeah, Goa would be awesome. I haven\\'t chosen a place where to live next, so I can\\'t really picture where to retire yet!\\n[Where to next?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bplzm?context=5)|We\\'re in Ecuador and heading to the Galapagos Islands in a couple of weeks. Really looking forward to it! After Ecuador, either Peru of Bolivia. Peru visa is a bitch for my boyfriend though (he is Indian and in many cases they ask him to apply for visas in his country of origin!!!) So let\\'s see how things turn out! :)\\n[If you go to Bolivia, make sure you try the coke!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bt1we?context=5)|We don\\'t do drugs, and I am guessing you\\'re not talking about coca-cola.\\n[So how do you do it.

I might be wrong?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4c0kxr?context=5)|Yes, it is expensive. Instead of booking a boat ahead of time, we are going to the island and try to score a last minute deal from there itself. It might still cost $700/5 days for each, but it\\'s a once in a life time experience. We\\'ve come from so far, it would only be silly not to go there after all. What are the chances we come back anyway?\\n |We don\\'t skip on doing the main things we are interested in. I\\'d rather travel for a bit less time and spend the money on what makes us happy - that goes as well for not sleeping in the cheapest places. At the end of this I don\\'t want to brag saying \"I was on the road for XYZ months\". I want to be able to remember and talk about the great experiences we\\'ve had in whatever amount of time we managed to travel for.\\n[Galapagos is an awesome place to visit. A lot of tourists traps, and overpriced souvenirs that you probably wont buy anyways but that easily have 1000% markup.  Where have you been in Ecuador?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bvui7?context=5)|Yeah, we\\'ll have to be careful with expenses in Galapagos. I\\'ll just skip the souvenirs all together. In Ecuador: Quito, Banos, Puyo, Latacunga, Quilotoa and right now in Riobamba. Loving it!\\n[How about languages? Do you usually get away with just English, or do you (or your boyfriend) know any others? Did you have to hire a translator?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4btvxi?context=5)|Never hired a translator.

So we\\'ve never had any trouble communicating. At least not so far... let\\'s wait until we head to China! ;)\\n[Try to not miss out on Peru and Bolivia!

I don\\'t get tired of explaining people that I do spend less money some months while traveling than I would do while living in Lisbon or Dubai. It\\'s also true that while I am traveling I am not earning, but if you manage to save a decent amount of cash, it can really go a long way, depending where you travel to. Right now I am in Latin America and money stretches quite a bit (compared to Europe). But in South East Asia this money would go even a much longer way!! It\\'s just a matter or priorities I guess! :) \\n[Go to Ambato, and try Cuenca and the incan ruins around (Cuenca has a very nice colonial downtown and people are really nice)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bwrru?context=5)|We stayed in Quito 2 weeks and were living a bit outside-ish the city, but still in the city: Barrio Orquideas/Monjas.\\n[Quito is huge, musts are centro historico (downtown) and it pays to get away from Quito to explore smaller communities. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bwrru?context=5)|We\\'re going to Cuenca in a couple of days! :)\\n[You won\\'t find many people speaking other than Chinese in China but it really doesn\\'t matter; I spent three months there with only the words for \"hello\", \"thank you\", \"rice/food\" and \"do not have\" and got by absolutely fine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4c2ulj?context=5)|Yeah... my boyfriend did go to China a few years back and mentioned EVERYTHING is in Chinese. Usually, I believe that by basic words (like you say) and by pointing you can go by just fine.. but sometimes this turns out funny. When he was in China, there was some man on a street stall with a snake. As he pointed at it and approched the stall to take a sneak peak of the snake, the dude took the snake, cut it off and dripped its blood on a glass for my bf to drink!! He was like WTF!!  So gotta be careful at what we point, I guess! ;)\\n[Machu Pichu is awesome.

I hear that underneath the glitz and glamour that it isn\\'t a very fun place to live in.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4brh3b?context=5)|1) Dubai was a very bittersweet place. I was done with it to be honest. It\\'s like living a lie, every single day. On the surface you have the expats with the awesome lifestyle - people have good salaries, spend money like crazy and have a lot of superficial relationships. People come and go so it\\'s difficult to make friends, real friends. Some people abroad still think that in Dubai everybody is rich. SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH!! There is a lot of misery and exploitation of the most basic human rights. It\\'s pretty disgusting. I basically left Dubai because didn\\'t want to contribute to such society. People get blinded by their pay cheques and but their principles and values aside while in Dubai. I couldn\\'t take it for much longer. And it is a racist society... which is something I don\\'t tolerate.\\n[2)Run into any trouble?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4brh3b?context=5)|2) Never had any trouble. I was living with my boyfriend and we were not married. This is ILLEGAL in Dubai. But as long as no one knows, nobody should care. If police were to find out (imagine you have a fire at home and somebody needs to come and check on you, for example...) then we would have been fucked. Prison + deportation. You don\\'t kid with the law in a place like the UAE.\\n[3)What about animals? Any beasts that stick out in your mind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4brh3b?context=5)|3) No animals, no! ;)\\n[What has been the most important lesson that your travels have taught you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bpmmv?context=5)|Tough one! ;) Probably would have to be not to take anything for granted and that everything is relative. I shouldn\\'t have a \"standard\" or preconceived idea for anything. What is \"normal\" where I come from might not be \"normal\" somewhere else in the world, and it\\'s important to keep and open mind and try to understand before judging. Actually I started learning that lesson before I traveling as such... just moving from Portugal to Dubai showed me how life and prespectives can be so different!\\n[Thank you for sharing! I look forward to following your website. I have a few more questions: Is there anything you wish you knew or would of planned for before you undertook this journey? What practical advice do you have to give to aspiring world travelers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bprtd?context=5)|Only thing I regret so far is [taking my video camera to the Carnival in Salvador, Brazil](http://bkpk.me/salvador-da-bahia-a-carnaval-tale-with-a-not-so-happy-ending/) For the sake of getting cool footage for my website, I ended up without a camera. Stupid me! :P My boyfriend\\'s parents were REALLY COOL though and sponsored a new camera. Now I know they like me... hahaa!! ;)\\n |As per advice to aspiring world travelers: work to save some money before you head out. Even if you are going to work while traveling, it\\'s always good and comfortable to have some savings to back you up. Even when you are hating your job, think of all the travels that those hours of hard work and sweat are going to allow you! And most importantly: MAKE A MOVE! Most people say they wish they could travel but don\\'t really make an effort towards that goal. Actually [just wrote about it on the website](http://bkpk.me/change-your-mind-quit-your-job-and-move-forward/) In most situations, if you want, you can. There\\'s most probably a way! \\n[This is something that I have wanted to do for a while. How much money (USD) would you recommend having to travel around India and that part of Asia for a few months maybe a year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s7iab/iama_29_yo_female_who_quit_work_to_travel_around/c4bpvzz?context=5)|Depends on what kind of traveling style and budget you have in mind: super budget backpacker, mid-range, etc.. I am traveling as a backpacker but not doing the cheapest of the cheapest things (mostly this reflects on food you eat but particularly in places you spend the night at).\\n |For India and Asia you could rather confortably spend a year going around for USD 15,000 or so. Even USD 10,000 if you are willing to rough it up. When I say Asia here I mean mainly South East Asia, which tends to be quite affordable. India is a great budget destination as well. There is so much to see, do and learn over there. And it\\'s affordable compared to most destinations world wide!\\n |What will also influence your expenses is how much you want to move. If you \"travel slow\" then your money will last longer. Great thing about India and SEA is that even flights are inexpensive compared to many places around the world. There tends to be quite a lot of competition between airlines and so there are good budget options for national and international flights.\\n |What countries do you have in mind?\\n[Honestly I have not done to much research into it since it would be a few months or a year before I had the ability to travel.
