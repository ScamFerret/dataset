However, over the last year, the gutter guards have been damaged, blown off my gutters, or been torn apart by the elements. They appear to be the cheap, plastic, flexible kind.\\n\\nI'm debating whether to replace them or just remove them and have someone clean the gutters once a year (my wife would prefer that I not do it myself).\\n\\nMy gutters are in the front of the house and back of the house in a straight line. 95 feet in the front, 95 feet in the back. I live in Long Island and I do not live in a wooded area. My neighbors do have some tall trees behind my house, including a pine needle tree next door.\\n\\nI got 3 quotes for gutter guards and they seem expensive:\\n\\nCompany 1: $1500 for 5 inch microguard covers. [https://www.englertinc.com/gutters/microguard](https://www.englertinc.com/gutters/microguard)\\n\\nCompany 2: $1500 ($1350 if cash) for metal mesh guards. Very similar guards to Company 1.\\n\\nCompany 3: This company offered 2 options. $850 for standard aluminum gutter screens or $1100 for white hoover damn step down gutter guards. It looked like this: [https://homesupply.com/products/hoov...e-gutter-guard](https://homesupply.com/products/hoover-dam-3-ft-white-gutter-guard)\\n\\nAll three companies will perform the tasks of removing all the existing guards, cleaning out the gutters, and then installing the new ones (all three companies drill them in).\\n\\nI attempted to attach some pic of the trees in my backyard, but it seems attaching pics is not an option.  Some feedback, advice, or guidance would really be appreciated. Thank you.\", 'comments': [\"Remove them. You still have to clean the gutters anyway, as sediment and other small particles can build up and block thems. It's better to just get in the habit of cleaning them or hiring someone to do it twice a year.\\n\\nYou can upload pictures to imgur and link them in your post.\", 'I don’t have gutter guards mainly because I don’t find cleaning gutters all that difficult. I can reach all of mine easily with an extension ladder. \\n\\nThat being said, if you are paying someone else to do it plan on more than once a year if you have any trees around. I do my a couple of times in the fall and trees shed leaves in late summer as well (I need to clean my gutters as we speak). Plus anytime I notice water overflowing the gutters when it rains.
