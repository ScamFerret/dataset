There are no required solid packing resins to replace or regenerate. Sample recovery rates of 100% are typical due to the non-adsorbing, liquid-liquid configuration of the system. High purities and throughputs With Fast Centrifugal Partition Chromatography®, solvent systems are tuned to target individual molecular types or groups of molecular species. Molecular species are separated based on small differences their affinities to each phase in the solvent system. No sample loss and 100% recovery The liquid-liquid rotor of the FCPC® allows for complete sample recovery through an extrusion step at the end of each run. Target molecules are eluted in order of their affinity to the mobile phase solvent, and the remainder of the sample can be collected from the extrusion step and reprocessed in a separate run. Low solvent consumption FCPC® uses significantly less solvent that other types of solid-bed (resin) chromatography. With solvent consumption rates as low as 50 ml per gram of sample processed, FCPC® can provide significant savings in solvent recovery and waste. Scalable Results The Kromaton FCPC® is available in a range of sizes from analytical laboratory scale through pilot plant production scale.
