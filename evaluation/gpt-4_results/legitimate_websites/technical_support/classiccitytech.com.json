From wall-mounting a television to full network administration for your business, we handle it all. Even up to and including designing and deploying a war-on-terror network for our government! No scope is too big or too small for us to handle. In a nutshell, if it involves technology, give us a shout. The only real exception is that we do not handle professional coding (cudos to the coders out there but we just aren’t into that). And unlike the big guys, we aren’t looking for any get-rich-quick schemes or ways to lock you into contracts. Our driving ideal is to provide service of such quality that you want to continue using us without the need of binding contracts.

Sadly, many businesses use their clients’ lack of understanding against them purely for increased profit. You won’t find that at Classic City Technology. The owner founded the business on the ideal of being able to go home and smile when he looked into the mirror, knowing that he had done everything he could to take care of his clients as family rather than a source of money. This ideal has driven the business since it was founded in 2004 and still holds strong today. We are a small family owned business where you aren’t just a customer, you’re family. We take a professional, service-oriented approach to all jobs. It’s done once and done right. Rather than advertising, we leave our work to speak for us and generate all business purely from word-of-mouth reviews. If you ever find yourself needing work or you need help figuring out what actually needs to be done (and not what some big store told you should be done for a big price), give us a call. We are always happy to lend a hand. “…Classic City Tech helped me defeat problems that my security software couldn’t handle, and on two of those occasions, help was off-hours.” Alan G “…Your after-market service blows away your competition. Your quick response, not only to any equipment problems, but especially to ‘user’ problems has decrease stress levels for me on so many occasions. You are my computer hero.” Gwen B “Thanks so very much for your help! I really, really appreciate what you do and the “service-oriented” way you do it.” Rick S Please never hesitate to call us for anything.
