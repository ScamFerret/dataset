This may be because the owner does not want to get spammed. However, it also makes it difficult to identify the real owner of the website. As a result, websites hiding their identity get a slightly lower score. Webshop Analysis According to Tranco this site has a low Tranco rank. This means that the number of visitors to this website is quite low. You can expect this from a small, starting or niche website. A popular website however should have a higher ranking. Technical Analysis A valid SSL certificate was found. Professional companies use an SSL certificate to encrypt communication between your computer and their website. However, there are different levels of certification and scammers also install a free SSL certificate. If you have to enter your data, never do this without checking if an SSL certificate protects your information.

It has a valid SSL certificate, which is a good sign, although it's noted that even scammers can install a free SSL certificate. The site has been around for a long time (22 years), which adds credibility. However, the owner uses a service to hide their identity on WHOIS, which Scamadviser considers slightly negative but also recognizes as a common practice to avoid spam. The site has a low Tranco rank, indicating low visitor numbers, but this isn't necessarily a sign of fraud for a small or niche business. Based on the observations, there are no indications that davisvirtualassistance.com exhibits the characteristics of a fraudulent website. The prices aren't unusually low, there's no mention of handling different products from common e-commerce websites, the payment methods aren't discussed, and the information seems up-to-date.
