The company seems to exist, with a physical address, and there are external reviews confirming its operations. 3. The company specializes in tech services, which is common for legitimate businesses in the IT sector. 4. The contact information provided appears to be appropriate for business use, with a phone number and a physical address. 5. The domain has been active for a significant period, which is typically a good sign. 6. I have not been able to directly assess the privacy policy or payment methods due to limitations in the actions I can take. Given these observations, there is no substantial evidence to conclude that the site is a fraudulent site. I now know the final answer.
