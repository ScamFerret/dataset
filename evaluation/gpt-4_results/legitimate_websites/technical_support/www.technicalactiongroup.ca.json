IT Service Areas in the Greater Toronto Area Referral Program for Managed IT Services IT Careers in the Toronto Area Contact 416-489-6312 ” We continually had problems before TAG Before TAG, it was one disaster after another. We continually had computer problems and things never seemed to get rectified properly. One of our employees who knew Joe from another company recommended him and we brought TAG into our company and ever since then, things have been fantastic. As a senior partner, I don’t get involved in the day-to-day operations, especially on the computer side. Plus, I’m not very computer literate which is why I love TAG so much – because things just work. They come whenever we call them. Everything runs smoothly and before TAG, we did not experience that. We went from chaos to peace of mind. Andrew Kay Senior Partner, Kay & Warburton, Chartered Accountants Without TAG, we could have suffered major downtime We wanted to partner with an IT support company who would make technical recommendations with a long-term view, and proactively resolve issues before they escalated into major incidents. This was demonstrated when one of TAG's technicians identified a hard drive failure on their monitoring tools. He immediately ordered a replacement hard drive and installed the hard drive in our office on a Sunday due to the urgency of the matter. Had TAG not identified the hard drive issue we may have suffered hours or days of zero productivity due to a downed server. It's proactive and responsive service like this that makes TAG such a trusted partner of ours since 2010! Bart Egnal President and Chief Executive Officer The Humphrey Group Responsive and professional at all times We are a mid-sized law firm with 14 separate geographic locations. We switched to TAG in an effort to upgrade our on-site support. TAG did an initial comprehensive review of our systems and implemented on it in a way that made me feel confident that our ongoing technical needs were being properly addressed. They were excellent in problem solving, responsive at all times and above all, professional. Their fees never deviated from what we originally agreed. Had we not opened up an internal IT department, we would have certainly continued to use their services. As an added bonus, Joe and Sandra were simply a pleasure to deal with. I would recommend them for your business needs without hesitation. Mark Morris Co-Founder Axess Law Professional Corp Knowledgeable, Courteous & Prompt We were in need of extensive advice regarding all aspects of our computers, internal network, internet services, website development and e-mail services. Joe and his team are extremely knowledgeable, courteous and prompt. We are very pleased we made the decision to choose The Technical Action Group as our Toronto IT services company. If you are looking for hassle-free IT solutions, take the time to talk to TAG. Rev. Craig Burton Superintendent, Eastern Ontario District The Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada Instant Resolution To An Internal Part Of Our Business With our last Toronto IT support services company, we weren’t getting any leads off of our website. After asking them to check if things were working ok, they said there weren’t any problems, but we continued to go for months with no web leads. When we hired TAG, they instantly identified a backlog of about 2,500 e-mails from our website that hadn’t come through to us – we were horrified at how much business this might have cost us over the past year! In about 6 or 7 minutes, Mike Stroud of TAG detected the problem, and then resolved it and we now get all of our website e-mails. TAG was able to instantly correct something that is an integral part of our business. Dan Goldhar President Admar Promotions Critical Factor In The Success Of Client Projects After going through a number of hardware and network support in Toronto partners that proved to be generally unreliable, unprofessional and sloppy, we started to refer Technical Action Group to our clients over 2 years ago. TAG has proven to be an effective, reliable and professional partner that we are now comfortable staking our reputation on. Jonathan Kay President Datapro Technology Solutions They Enabled Us To Work More Efficiently TAG has helped us to develop and maintain a computer network that is suited specifically to our business needs. The recommendations they have given us have improved our systems and enabled us to work more efficiently. TAG has always been extremely responsive to our trouble calls for technical support. They always return them promptly with a solution being found immediately. Richard Warburton They Relieve My Stress With TAG monitoring our systems, they catch things before we realize we have a problem. If they weren’t doing this, it would slow us down – our workflow is now in more in order than before we hired TAG and everything is on track. They relieve my stress by fixing issues and they are very reliable, which is key to me. I would definitely recommend TAG. They’re friendly, helpful and not arrogant – like some other IT guys have been with us. TAG gets the job done on time and everything just flows. Gary Cain Operations Manager Elizabeth Grant International I Feel Great Trust With TAG We were growing very quickly and the Toronto computer support that our previous person was giving us, we didn’t feel was sufficient for our needs, so we were recommended to TAG. Since TAG has been supporting our network, our employees feel more comfortable because things run smoothly. We completely trust TAG. In the one-on-one dealings I have had with Joe and his people, I find they are very knowledgeable and they have found effective solutions for us.When we do experience any issues they respond efficiently and quickly and they communicate with us in terms we understand. Herb Goldstein Chairman Morris Marketing Group We Depend On TAG TAG came to us highly recommended. In our initial meetings, we were impressed with TAG’s knowledge. They were personable and we felt confident that Joe and his team would work hard and make necessary changes to keep our computers, network and internet services running smoothly. We are pleased with the decision to use TAG as our outsourced IT services provider in Toronto. Many modifications to our system were necessary. Their expert advice, prompt response time and approachability have been very valuable. As the IT contact, I have confidence just knowing I can rely on TAG to answer a question or look into something right away. They keep us running smoothly! We depend on TAG and would highly recommend them. Cheryl Rogers Executive Assistant to District Superintendent The Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada – Eastern Ontario Division Our Employees Are Happier And More Productive Before hiring TAG, we had multiple problems… our servers were running out of memory, they were slow and sometimes freezing. We had problems with our virus software and a myriad of other problems with laptops and desktops that our previous support company weren’t able to fix in an adequate timeframe or with the right attitude. Thankfully, we found TAG. Through TAG’s managed IT services, We now have more productive uptime with our computers, our employees are happier and more productive, and my life is easier because I can rely more on my IT company now and I have faith in TAG to deliver on all of our needs. They’re a great fit for us and I would absolutely recommend them. Daniel Kolber Vice-President Asset Management Retrocom Mid-Market REIT If Our Building Blows Up, We’re Still In Business The Next Day With our previous Toronto IT support services provider, our server was always crashing. They didn’t have the knowledge to handle our computer troubles. There were times when our server was down for half a day! They would come in and fix that which was broken, but we wanted to make sure that nothing got broken. We were really concerned about not being properly backed up and we wanted a company that could solve a problem quickly. If we go down and we can’t access our server, we’re out of business. We made the decision to hire TAG and subscribe to their TAGuard Backup & Disaster Recovery Service for Small Business. As well, they are doing preventative activities on all of our systems. Now everything is running fine, my employees are happy and more efficient and I have total peace of mind. If the building blows up tomorrow, we’re still going to be in business the day after. I’ve already recommended TAG to others because they really know what they’re doing and are very responsive.
