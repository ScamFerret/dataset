Justin cannot provide straight answers on what he will do and is clueless. Both love to blame Harper for everything instead.   \\n\\nThomas Mulcair - Mansbridge interview (uncut)     \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdLA5EQrDK8    \\n    \\nJusin Trudeau - Mansbridge interview (uncut)   \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spqrNKo45UM     \\n\\nAfter watching this, many will not believe these fools are running for PM of a G7 country.   \\n\\nAs election date nears, undecided voters looking for change will take them even more seriously and be suspicious.  \\n\\nCPC planned campaign slogan for Harper \"Proven Leadership\" perfectly. These interviews now play right into it.   \\n\\nElizabeth May had the best interview.  \\n\\nHer points on working together in parliament and taking serious steps on climate will be highly appealing to progressives.  \\n\\nElizabeth May - Mansbridge interview     \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgtSjA8xsnQ   \\n\\n\\n2) Justin Trudeau says large percentage of small businesses are used for tax scams.        \\n\\n\"Business owners clash with Trudeau for saying wealthy Canadians use small business tax rates to reduce bills\"      \\nhttp://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/business-owners-clash-with-trudeau-for-saying-wealthy-canadians-use-small-business-tax-rates-to-reduce-bills  \\n\\nIf I was in CPC war room, this is an easy attack ad. I would mail flyers with his comment straight to small businesses across Canada. I would send candidates to personally deliver the flyers in ridings where internal polls show LPC is doing well.     \\n\\n3) Justin Trudeau considering to pull out of foreign policy debate!  \\n\\nI speculate this is because Mansbridge killed him on the ISIS question and showed he is dumb. And expectations are high for him now since he also enjoyed poll bump after making big promises.   \\n\\nNot coming to that debate will be huge mistake. Makes it more easy for Harper to persuade Blue Liberals voters.       \\n\\n4) Syrian kid story has new twist: His own father allegedly was driving the boat.  \\n\\nMultiple passengers claim Aylan Kurdi\\'s father drove capsized boat     \\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/11/us-europe-migrants-turkey-iraq-idUSKCN0RB2BE20150911     \\n  \\nClaims Aylan Kurdi\\'s father \\'people smuggler\\'        \\n http://www.skynews.com.au/news/top-stories/2015/09/11/claims-alan-kurdi-s-father-a-people-smuggler.html       \\n\\nAylan Kurdi\\'s father \\'a people smuggler\\': Fresh allegations have emerged that the father of the little boy pictured drowned on a Turkish beach was a people smuggler [Video]    \\nhttp://media.smh.com.au/video-news/video-world-news/aylan-kurdis-father-a-people-smuggler-6841140.html      \\n\\nThis revelation will anger millions of Canadians. He blamed Canada for death of his kid. Now it appears allegedly he may himself have killed him while allegedly also smuggling many others.        \\n\\n5) Mulcair defends the NDP MP in Syrian kid story:   \\n\\n\"Mulcair stands behind Fin Donnelly, after Kurdi family confusion\"      \\nhttp://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/election/mulcair-stands-behind-donnelly-after-kurdi-family-confusion-1.2558642     \\n   \\n6) Canadian media starts pumping out articles all week about refugee crisis and how Harper is not doing enough.           \\n\\nProblem is:   \\n\\na) This is not top priority for many Canadians in this election.   \\n\\nb) People these days get world news from facebook/twitter by following international news media accounts. Canadians are seeing the horror unfold in Europe where [fake refugees/economic migrants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDqhptRULFw) are flooding in to get welfare in Germany.  \\n\\nNow Canadian media suddenly wants them think it is a good idea to do it here too.         \\n\\nNormally Harper has to give nightmare by running ads to remind voters of high taxes, but now this is happening for free.   \\n\\nMedia people, unlike your average Joe, live in fantasy progressive world (AKA the ottawa buble) and believe Harper is heartless scum and we should open the floodgates because they are emotional after seeing a pic.     \\n\\nNormal people seeing media attacking Harper will say wtf this guy makes sense. More attacks on Harper over refugees = more undecided voters rooting for Harper.  \\n\\nIt is possible a mini Donald Trump situation could take place here if media keeps going nuts. More U.S. media bashed Donald on illegal immigrants, his numbers kept going up.     \\n\\nSure media will influence many, but majority of people will not agree to bring in thousands of refugees.   \\n\\nOne recent poll showed only [36%](http://ipolitics.ca/2015/09/11/only-36-per-cent-of-canadians-want-to-accept-more-refugees/) of Canadians want more refugees.   \\n\\n7) Conservatives repeat they will not open the floodgates:    \\n\\n\"Conservatives rule out airlifts of Syrian refugees to Canada\"     \\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservatives-syrian-refugees-airlift-jason-kenney-1.3224967    \\n\\n8) Ontario will spend $10.5 million to open the province’s doors to 10,000 Syrian refugees     \\nhttp://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/09/12/ontario-will-spend-10m-to-bring-syrian-refugees-to-province.html   \\n\\n9) Jean Chrétien says Stephen Harper \\'has shamed Canada\\'   \\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jean-chretien-stephen-harper-ashamed-1.3225673   \\n\\nRidiculous. Will please LPC leaning voters but rile up CPC leaning voters even more. Unnecessarily makes economic debate expectations high for Justin.             \\n\\n10) OLD VIDEO COMES OUT: Trudeau economic advisor and star Liberal Candidate says \"Let big 3 auto makers go bankrupt\"  \\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db5-YgIIkb0   \\n\\nNot in news so discarding it. Juicy stuff to bombard Ont. auto worker ridings with for sure.         \\n\\n11) Normally bozo eruptions by low key NDP/LPC candidates would be plus. But there have been way too many reports of candidates saying dumb things in past coming out. I don\\'t think they will matter in the long run. Good entertainment, but just sideshows. So I am discarding them.    \\n\\n\\n**Prediction on polls next week Monday Sept. 14:**  \\n\\nThe top 9 news events above will likely be discussed at work next week and influence the polls.  \\n\\nHarper will take lead in few more polls, remain in tight race in other polls all the way until major economic debate Thursday Sept. 17.  \\n\\n**Upcoming negative news and positive news next week**  \\n\\nBad news for Harper is the upcoming [Bruce Carson trial](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trial-of-former-adviser-bruce-carson-threatens-to-dog-harper/article26345408/) that is expected to start on Monday Sept. 14.   \\n\\nMedia will machine gun him, like during Duffy trial. Ask him questions daily. Media may reveal other explosive bad news via their investigative journalists around this time to get maximum negative impact.  \\n\\nHarper will counter will interesting announcing policies to east the damage.     \\n\\nGood news a): Ottawa’s final budget numbers for the 2014-15 fiscal year ended March 31 will be released on Monday. It will probably show we are doing not so bad fiscally.            \\n\\nGood news b): Upcoming highly important economic debate on Thursday Sept. 17. Many will watch this with great interest. I expect Harper to do well by showing he is not going to engage in out of control spending. Run affordable fiscal plan. Let us keep more money in our pocket. Public will realize he is the only competent man for the job compared to alternatives, despite all his problems).   \\n\\n**Week after the debate (Monday Sept. 21)**: Hard to predict this early without knowing news from previous week..       \\n\\nBut without major shocking negative news for Harper. I think hits coming from trial will be absorbed from wide coverage of economic debate (which I expect Harper to do well in). Harper will take lead again by Thursday Sept. 24 / Friday Sept. 25. This is the time after which people at work will discuss policies talked about in debate, read articles on it and influence the polls.      \\n\\n**After the debate:** I expect CPC to begin their ad barrage around Monday Sept. 21 to continue building their poll lead.   \\n  \\nAt this point, I continue to predict CPC majority up-to 40% (BC+AB+SK+MB+ON). People vote for stability over risky alternatives.   \\n ', 'comments': ['The refugee \"crisis\" will win this one for ol\\'Harps.', 'i agree with pretty much all of this', 'shocking development: Elizabeth May is secretly a \"Harper Special Agent\" who has gone deep undercover in the radical left wing to help control and split the left vote for Führer Harper.', 'Fun fact; you can vote early.', \"Yeah I don't know why so much of /r/canada think Trudeau and Mulcair did so well on the Mansbridge interview.

I don\\'t think it will be have much to do with religion (see [here](http://www.theprovince.com/opinion/columnists/douglas+todd+could+trump+like+religious+victory+happen/12653342/story.html)) - we simply don\\'t have enough religious people (still amazing to me that Christians supported Trump ...utter hypocrites). We already have the Christian Heritage Party, and they\\'re practically unknown. And to be frank, the Christian Right has lost a ton of legitimacy since the Bush era - and they don\\'t seem to be part of rightwing discourse anymore, in Canada or elsewhere. I suspect they\\'re also just too polite to be involved in current political landscape. They might play a tiny factor  if a populist pays a minimal amount of lip-service to them, but as a major role, in Canada? I just don\\'t see it.\\n\\nNo, if right-wing populism takes over it will be because some combination of most if not all of the following:\\n\\n1) anti-immigrant backlash and the rise of alt-right racism and their current increasing prevalence, and seemingly effective ability to spin narratives and their own [fake news](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/07/german-police-quash-breitbart-story-of-mob-setting-fire-to-dortmund-church) (Rebel Media in Canada?), and their strange alliance of the alt-right with (and yet at the same time backlash against) free market economics.\\n\\n2) the continuing economic ideological status quo i.e. the prevalence of economic free market fundamentalism, the popularity of libertarianism, and fiscal conservative narrative conservatives push the notion that somehow they are better with money\\n\\n3) increasing economic pressure on the average Canadian, and the probable failure of liberals to do anything constructive and/or meaningful, or even acknowledge its existence\\n\\n4) related; some kind of financial crisis or other black swan event\\n\\n5) an utterly impotent and hopeless leftist alternative to the Liberal Party (i.e. the current NDP)\\n\\n6) Russian social engineering, maybe even American social engineering under Trump\\n\\n7) some islamic or other terrorist event\\n\\n8) a continuation of the current political & psychosocial landscape of general meanspiritedness, that is the fact that suddenly right-wing authoritarianism is \"cool\" again\\n\\n9) the prevalence of political echo chambers and \"safe spaces\" (on both the right and the left)\\n\\nHave I missed anything?\\n\\nAt this point, I\\'m concerned that our best hope to avoid this is that a  Trump presidency turns out to be a total fiasco, and therefore people will think twice before voting in our own right-wing scam artist.

Or is this overstated?\\n\\n\\n\\nEDIT: This is not meant as a commentary on the previous government!

Is it simply the Conservatives winning in 2019, or would it have to be with a specific person?\\n\\nAnd don\\'t act like there isn\\'t \"fake news\" on both ends of the political spectrum.', '> 1) anti-immigrant backlash and the rise of alt-right racism and their current increasing prevalence, and seemingly effective ability to spin narratives and their own fake news (Rebel Media in Canada?), and their strange alliance of the alt-right with (and yet at the same time backlash against) free market economics.\\n\\nthe last reduction in immigration occurred under Trudeau the CPC has not restricted immigration or the source countries of immigration.\\n\\nhttps://www.honestreporting.ca/hrc-prompts-toronto-star-clarifications-israel-isnt-building-more-settlements-supports-2-state-solution/17020\\n\\nhttps://www.honestreporting.ca/cbc-ombud-partially-upholds-hrc-complaint-report-shouldve-mentioned-unwra-ties-to-hamas/17031\\n\\nhttps://www.honestreporting.ca/hrc-prompts-2-globe-mail-corrections-on-settlements-and-u-s-aid-to-israel/17038\\n\\nplenty of fake news going around on all accounts it isn\\'t an \\'alt-right\\' issue it is a matter of crap journalism and opinion being treated as news far to often.\\n\\n> 2) the continuing economic ideological status quo i.e. the prevalence of economic free market fundamentalism, the popularity of libertarianism, and fiscal conservative narrative conservatives push the notion that somehow they are better with money\\n\\n\\'libertarianism\\' isn\\'t all that popular by any means and I say that as a libertarian.  The reality is that for instance \\n\\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/decades-deficits-morneau-1.3923060\\n\\nsuggests it isn\\'t just \\'narrative conservatives push\\' but an actual issue with how the LPC is running things.\\n\\n> 3) increasing economic pressure on the average Canadian, and the probable failure of liberals to do anything constructive and/or meaningful, or even acknowledge its existence\\n\\nThat is a pretty serious reason to elect a new government.  It isn\\'t an issue of \\'alt-right\\' it is an issue of the \\'ctrl-left\\' doing a piss poor job.  When governments do a piss poor job we should replace them.\\n\\n> 4) related; some kind of financial crisis or other black swan event\\n\\nDeficits for the next 3 decades is a financial crisis it isn\\'t a black swan event.\\n\\n> 5) an utterly impotent and hopeless leftist alternative to the Liberal Party (i.e. the current NDP)\\n\\nMaybe the issue is in the left and not the right.  The LPC and the NDP are unable to control their grassroots elements and thus do not provide platforms that can be implemented while the right in Canada has been very good at keeping its most extreme unable to do anything once in power.\\n\\n> 6) Russian social engineering, maybe even American social engineering under Trump\\n\\nwe have had endless social engineering under the LPC for decades and decades from our \\'bilingual\\' to our \\'multicultural\\' to the CBC acting in a painfully partisan fashion against its own mandate.\\n\\n> 7) some islamic or other terrorist event\\n\\nDid nothing to sway past elections as it appears that the LPC and CPC have similar policies when it comes to facts on the ground.  From Chretien providing our navy under the 1991 embargo during the 2nd Iraq war to some dubious usage of NATO policies to deploy Canadian forces in the Balkans to our illegal bombing of Libya.  Doesn\\'t matter which side you pick on this they both act the same.\\n\\n> 8) a continuation of the current political & psychosocial landscape of general meanspiritedness, that is the fact that suddenly right-wing authoritarianism is \"cool\" again\\n\\nbecause its 2015?  Calling real concerns about economic forecasts \\'politics of fear\\' was left wing meanspiritedness,  the absolute staggering rise of LPC and NDP commentators posting meme images during the last election attacking Harper and the CPC was meanspiritedness,  suggesting that Harper who increased immigration in each of his years from muslim nations was somehow anti-muslim was meanspiritedness.  The left simply disguises its arguments differently and in a package that easily fools the youth.\\n\\n> 9) the prevalence of political echo chambers and \"safe spaces\" (on both the right and the left)\\n\\nthey always existed in some form or another we simply moved from the church parking lot to facebook and reddit.\\n\\n> At this point, I\\'m concerned that our best hope to avoid this is \\n\\nI\\'d suggest the best way to avoid extremes is GOOD GOVERNMENT!!!  If the Trudeau\\'s of the world want to avoid people like Duterte or Trump being elected they need to stop acting like Merkel and start acting like bland and boring administrators of government.  Politics should be boring as all living shit and this game where the left tries to dress it up like it is a celebrity gossip magazine disgusts adults.  Even worse is the rise of family dynasties in politics and the staggering level at which the traditional parties all get funded by the same groups in the same ways.', 'I don\\'t think you\\'ll see it here, just on a mechanical level. To win a majority of the House of Commons, such an \"alt-right\" candidate would have to take 170 ridings. Harper managed to get a majority by moderating his message and with a lucky break of the left vote. Anti-immigrant rhetoric won\\'t go over well in most urban areas, where many seats are. \\n\\nWe don\\'t even have a unified notion of Conservatism nationwide - you\\'d break the CPC into two distinct parties if some extremist populist took over. Canada\\'s used to a multiparty system, the US isn\\'t. Go too far right, and you alienate more and more of the country. \\n\\nPlus, Trump won the primaries with a number of pluralities early on, losing opponents along the way. The Canadian system of selecting a leader doesn\\'t involve round after round after round of primaries, and since we use ranked balloting and runoffs, a simple plurality won\\'t give an alt-right candidate control of the party.', 'Just wait and see...', \"Reading these comments makes me realize that Canada is nothing more than an extension of American culture.

And the current crop is suffering from the same old disease.\\n\\nAt least, that’s according to Alfred Apps, a veteran political organizer and former party president who is now serving as “mentor” to a group of younger partisans — calling themselves the [MayDay Movement](https://www.maydaymaidezca.org/) — who feel the federal Liberals need a shot of life.\\n\\nAhead of the party’s national convention in Ottawa, which begins Thursday in a cavernous event centre overlooking the Rideau Canal, they’re also raising questions about whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party, in power since 2015, is best prepared to take on Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives and win its fourth election in a row.\\n\\nNo federal leader has done that since Wilfrid Laurier — the model for Trudeau’s professed “sunny ways” — in 1908. And now, on the eve of their first in-person national convention since 2018, even some Liberal MPs are acknowledging the party could benefit from a boost of enthusiasm to try and match that elusive feat.\\n\\n“I think every party needs to renew itself, continually renew itself,” said Scarborough—Guildwood MP John McKay. “We are facing challenges. Let’s face it, stuff that’s coming out with respect to (foreign) influence operations, that’s serious stuff, and it certainly affects how we may conduct an election.\"\\n\\nOthers said the convention is an opportunity for Liberals to reconnect with volunteers and colleagues after years of pandemic-forced separation. “It’s a good kick in the — not kick, maybe, a shot in the arm,” said Labour Minister Seamus O’Regan.\\n\\nOmar Alghabra, the transport minister, used a different metaphor to describe his hopes for the convention.\\n\\n“This is like our charging station where people will be re-energized, reconnect and get excited about the future,” he said.\\n\\nYet members of the MayDay movement — as in “[mayday, mayday, we’re going down](https://www.maydaymaidezca.org/english/what-is-mayday)” — say the party needs to find better ways to motivate and engage with younger Canadians, which they define as people aged 35 and under.\\n\\nIn an interview with the Star, Apps said he believes the Liberal party is at risk of losing touch with the younger, centre-leaning progressives it needs to remain in power. Liberal clubs on universities campuses sputtered during the pandemic as students shifted to online learning. And now. Liberals are facing an opponent in Poilievre who has proven adept at speaking to younger Canadians through social media, said Apps, who is a lawyer in Toronto.\\n\\n“The Liberal party’s been through this natural governing illness for the last century,” said Apps, describing how the party has been roundly defeated after holding power for a long stretches in the past, even as he credited the Liberals with building a centrist coalition that has ushered in public health care and made Canada a top immigration destination and a successful progressive society on the world stage.\\n\\n“We’re fighting for the continuation of a moderate progressive and fiscally responsible centre,” he said.\\n\\nFor Suzanne Cowan, such a force is well-established and in no risk of waning. As president of the party since 2018, Cowan said the Liberals are on a solid financial footing, well-stocked with volunteers, and motivated to debate new policies and get set for the next federal election campaign.\\n\\nMore than 3,500 delegates — around 40 per cent of whom have never attended such an event before — are expected to attend this week’s three-day convention, she said.\\n\\nCowan also responded to criticism from Apps and the MayDay movement, stating that it’s true the party needed to revitalize campus clubs after the pandemic and that the Liberals should always be open to new ideas to connect with Canadians. But she also stressed that hundreds of young Liberals still took part in the process to create and choose more than two dozen [policy resolutions](https://2023.liberal.ca/policy/) that will be debated during the convention.\\n\\n**The MayDay group’s** [**suggested policies**](https://www.maydaymaidezca.org/english/policy-resolutions) **— which include a pledge to add economic and environmental rights to the Constitution, and create a digital ID that Canadians could use to vote online — were rejected for consideration at the convention because they were introduced outside the formal process that began almost two years ago, Cowan said.**\\n\\n“We wanted to protect the integrity of the process that they had undertaken,” she said.\\n\\nThat process resulted in 36 resolutions slated for debate during the convention. On the list is a call for the party to promise a clear plan to balance the federal budget in the next election. There are also pushes to fast-track infrastructure to increase exports to Canada’s NATO allies, create a high speed rail corridor through southern Ontario and Quebec, table legislation for a guaranteed livable income, and use 30 per cent of federally owned lands and properties for affordable housing.\\n\\nAt the same time, Cowan acknowledged the party needs to always look for “new ways to keep people excited” about the Liberal project — especially after the party has held power for more than seven years.\\n\\n“We can’t be complacent. We need to continue to innovate,” she said.\\n\\n“We need to continue to make sure that we **are relevant Canadians,** and that we are using the best ways to communicate, and that we’re constantly trying to improve how we’re communicating … to prove to (Canadians) that we are worthy of their support.”\\n\\nPart of the challenge for the Liberals can be charted in financial returns and recent polls. The Liberals trail the Conservatives on each front.\\n\\nThe most recent financial returns filed with Elections Canada show the Conservatives’ long-standing fundraising lead grew to almost $5 million in the first three months of this year, when the party raked in $8.3 million to the Liberals’ $3.6 million.\\n\\nAnd polls have shown the Liberals lagging the Conservatives for months in national vote intention.\\n\\nThe MayDay Movement hopes to try and move that needle in favour of the Liberals with the enthusiasms of more Canadians who under 35. According to Apps, the group has raised more than $200,000 to support more than 300 such people to attend the Liberal convention this week.\\n\\nCallista Ryan, 24, of Squamish, B.C., is one of the group’s original organizers. She said engaging younger Canadians is a problem across the political spectrum, not just for the Liberals. But she believes the party is still the best vehicle to advance policies she supports, given its long track record of victory at the federal level.\\n\\nGreg Fergus, the Liberal MP for Hull—Aylmer, was president of the Young Liberals in the 1990s. He said the youth wing has always pushed the Liberal party on a host of policies, including in his time when he championed marriage equality years before it [became law federally in 2005](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/same-sex-marriage-in-canada).\\n\\n“The Liberal party pays a lot of attention to its youth wing, because more often than not they get it right before the rest of us do,” Fergus said.\\n\\nSeven years into the Trudeau government’s lifespan, Fergus said he is looking forward to gathering with other Liberals to gather — with a close ear to what young partisans are saying — to refresh the party for the years ahead.\\n\\n“Now is the perfect time for us to renew,” he said.', 'comments': ['so they are trying to subsume the historical may day labour movement, get the useful idiots on board, to actually crush the labour market', 'Good find!', '>headed by neo-nomad billionaire Dominic Barton that seeks to increase Canadian population to 100 million by 2100).  \\n\\n\\nThis guy must be fun at parties. His only friend is probably Mr. Sean Fraser.', 'Dude...
