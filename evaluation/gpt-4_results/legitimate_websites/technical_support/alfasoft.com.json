This absence of certificate information, combined with the DNS discrepancy, raises concerns about the legitimacy of the website.

To make a final determination, I should review all observations and see if they align with the characteristics of a fraudulent website. Based on all the actions taken and observations made, I now know the final answer. After considering all the evidence, there are some discrepancies and missing information (such as the DNS issue and lack of SSL certificate data), but overall, the website does not exhibit the typical characteristics of a fraudulent site as described in the initial brief. The site does not offer unusually low prices or free claims, the company information appears to be legitimate based on WHOIS data and online reviews, and the content of the site is consistent with that of a professional software provider. Therefore, I conclude that the website https://alfasoft.com/uk/software/design-and-engineering/math-and-calculations/mathcad/ is not a fraudulent site.",
