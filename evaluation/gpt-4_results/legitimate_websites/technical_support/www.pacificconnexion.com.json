Quite a number of persons were present who did not belong to  the Church, and one man, more bitter and skeptical than others, made  note with pencil and paper of a prophecy uttered on that occasion,  wherein Joseph said that ‘Forty days shall not pass, and the stars shall  fall from heaven.’\\n\\nSuch an event would certainly be very unusual and improbable to the  natural man, and the skeptic wrote the words as a sure evidence to prove  Joseph to be a false prophet.\\n\\n“On the thirty-ninth day after the utterance of that prophecy, a man and  brother in the Church, by the name of Joseph Hancock,… and another  brother were out hunting game and got lost. They wandered about until  night, when they found themselves at the house of this unbeliever, who  exultingly produced this note of Joseph Smith’s prophecy and asked  Brother Hancock what he thought of his prophet now that thirty-nine days  had passed and the prophecy was not fulfilled.\\n\\n“Brother Hancock was unmoved and quietly remarked, ‘There is one night  left of the time, and if Joseph said so, the stars will certainly fall  tonight. The prophecy will all be fulfilled.’\\n\\n“The matter weighed upon the mind of Brother Hancock, who watched that  night, and it proved to be the historical one, known in all the world as  ‘the night of the falling of the stars.’\\n\\n“He stayed that night at the house of the skeptical unbeliever, as it  was too far from home to return by night, and in the midst of the  falling of the stars, he went to the door of his host and called him out  to witness what he had thought impossible and the most improbable thing  that could happen, especially as that was the last night in which  Joseph Smith could be saved from the condemnation of a ‘false prophet.’\\n\\n“The whole heavens were lit up with the falling meteors, and the  countenance of the new spectator was plainly seen and closely watched by  Brother Hancock, who said that he turned pale as death and spoke not a  word.” Philo DibbleAlso see DHC I:416\\n\\n“To understand the use of the word shower in connection with shooting  stars we must go back to the early morning hours of Nov. 13, 1833, when  the inhabitants of this continent \\\\[of North America\\\\] were in fact  treated to one of the most spectacular natural displays that the night  sky has produced. . . . For nearly four hours the sky was literally  ablaze . . . . More than a billion shooting stars appeared over the  United States and Canada alone.” Peter M.

Throughout this immense region, the duration was  nearly the same.”  Denison Olmsted, Letters on Astronomy, Addressed to a  Lady: in Which The Elements of the Science Are Familiarly Explained in  Connexion With Its Literary History (1840 ed.), pp. 348, 349.', 'comments': ['Where did you read about the prophesy originally?', '[here is a cool write up about that star fall](https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2014/08/30/1833-meteor-storm-started-citizen-science/)', \"I'm one of those skeptical-by-nature people.

Visa\\n\\n**1) Préparation**\\n\\nPour commencer il faudra vous faire un vrai « résumé » à l’américaine (attention, ce n’est pas exactement la même chose que les CV français, il ne s’agit pas uniquement de traduite le CV), si possible en demandant à un local (les français de France, même courant en Anglais risquent de manquer certains éléments qui auraient été mal traduits).\\n\\nParmi les autres choses que vous pouvez faire:\\n\\n  - Prendre via Google Voice ou Skype un numéro local (US)\\n  - Mieux encore, mettre les coordonnées d’une connaissance habitant sur place. Il n’est plus nécessaire aux US de mettre son addresse complete, juste la ville et l’état pour indiquer que vous êtes (serez) déjà local suffit (mais ne pas mentir!)\\n  - Indiquer que vous avez un visa de travail (voir section 3 de cette page.) sur le résumé peut aussi aider.\\n\\nEn clair :\\xa0**éliminez le plus possible toutes les raisons pour lesquelles le « hiring manager » ne vous recontacterait pas malgré un profile intéressant**.\\n\\nEn parallèle, n’oubliez pas de vous assurer que votre présence en ligne est adéquate :\\n\\n  - Mettez à jour votre profile LinkedIn, et si possible avec un URL (ce qu’il y a après le “/in/” de type prenomnom ou équivalent, pas prenomnom suivi de pleins de chiffres et lettres aléatoires, ce qui est le defaut sur LinkedIn)\\n  - Vérifiez que vos post visibles par tous sur Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, X (Twitter) et autres sont appropriés pour un employeur\\n  - Et Googlez/Bingez-vous pour voir si rien de choquant ou compromettant n’apparait\\n\\nFinalement, décidez quel type de stage vous désirez (quel job, domaine…). Si plusieurs vous tentent, soyez prêt à faire plusieurs résumés appropriés.\\n\\n_Tip: ChatGPT/Bing AI/Claude/Bard peuvent vous aider a critiquer votre résumé, lettre d’intro, etc. Ne les utilisez pas pour tout faire à votre place mais plutot comme coach et correcteur._\\n\\n**2) Commencez votre recherche**\\n\\nEvitez à tous prix les emails génériques ou de parler de vos besoins (« mon école requiert que je fasse ABC… »).\\n\\nUtilisez ensuite les sites web des entreprises pour postuler soit sur des postes publiés soit en candidatures spontanées. Encore mieux : utilisez les connexions LinkedIn pour directement contacter les personnes.

Ce sponsor peut, dans certains cas, aussi aider à vous trouver un stage (mais c’est plus cher !). Voir ci-dessous pour une société en France pouvant s’occuper de cela en liaison avec une société sponsor de Seattle (CIDC, dont l’une des dirigeantes est française).\\n\\nLes différentes solutions :\\n\\n  - **Le job d’été aux USA**\\xa0est ouvert uniquement aux étudiants qui sont inscrits en Bac + 1 (ou plus). Ils doivent être disponibles pendant leurs vacances d’été au moins 4 mois, du 1er juin au 30 septembre (en dessous ce n’est même pas la peine de postuler!). Les inscriptions se font au plus tard le 1er avril de chaque année. Visa job d’été\\xa0**à partir de US$1,300**.\\n  - **Les stages (Internship)\\xa0**: doivent entrer dans le cadre des études et la durée varie entre 3 à 18 mois. Plus on reste longtemps, plus on a de chance d’être rémunéré. L’étudiant peut déjà avoir l’entreprise d’accueil. Le cout variera selon qu’il ait déjà trouvé le stage ou pas.\\n\\nStage « self placed » vs. “ full placement »\\n\\n  - Self-placed à partir de US$980, full-placement à partir de $2745\\n  - Le délai minimum est de 2 mois pour les «\\xa0self-placed\\xa0»\\xa0 et de 6 mois pour les «\\xa0full-placed\\xa0» car la procédure est longue et sans garantie au final d’obtention du visa!\\n\\n**Liens utiles:**\\n\\n  - Agence de placement en France partenaire avec le CIDC ici:\\xa0[www.aquariusabroad.org](https://www.aquariusabroad.org/)\\n  - Les informations de CIDC sur les stages ou jobs d’été aux US :\\xa0[www.cicdgo.com/internships-in-the-usa](https://www.cicdgo.com/internships-in-the-usa)\\n  - Article French District:\\xa0[frenchdistrict.com/californie-nord/articles/stage-etudiants-etats-unis-recherche-visa-ambassade-voyage](https://frenchdistrict.com/californie-nord/articles/stage-etudiants-etats-unis-recherche-visa-ambassade-voyage)\\n  - Chambre de commerce franco-américaine du Pacific North West:\\xa0[FACCPN.org](https://faccpn.org/)\\n\\nLire l’article sur le site internet de l’UFE: https://bit.ly/43J78X6\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n   \\n   \\n Plus de détails: https://bit.ly/43MURAL', 'comments': []}, {'title': 'Pre-terminated Systems Market Research Report', 'subreddit': 'OnlineMarketResearch', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineMarketResearch/comments/ocb5y2/preterminated_systems_market_research_report/', 'selftext': 'Global Pre-terminated Systems Market\\n\\nThe GMI Research forecasts that the Pre-terminated Systems Market is witnessing an upsurge in demand over the forecast period.

In addition, the rising demand and the mounting number of data centers to resolve the issues such as extended deployment time increased downtime, and higher installation cost will further strengthen the pre-terminated systems market size.

If Overwatch is your first Blizzard game, then maybe you are as confused as i was towards all this stuff with panels, competitions, some of it you can watch for free and some you can\\'t. I hope that if this is the case, this guide will make things clear. It is an updated version of a similar post I did last year, and should contain everything you need to enjoy Blizzcon 2018.\\n\\nAs the name suggests, Blizzcon is Blizzard\\'s own convention, where they celebrate their various franchises and use this big marketing occasion to make major announcements. Overwatch, for example, was revealed for the first time [at Blizzcon 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gECJQqlW3CU). \\n\\nLast year, Blizzcon was used to reveal Moira, a new map, (BlizzardWorld), the Honor and Glory animated short (still the best short dont @ me) and a bunch of new items for the normal loot box pool.\\n\\nThis guide will try to help you not miss any of this juicy stuff. It is divided in two categories : the content you can access for free, and the events locked behind the virtual ticket. Since Blizzcon is a mix of all Blizzard games, only Overwatch content will be mentioned here to make things easier. \\n\\nAll times provided will be in both Pacific (the convention being in California) and Central European (for my EU buddies) time. If that does not cover your timezone, use [this website](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20171023T120000&p1=783) to convert it to your local time. Just add your city with the big blue button.\\n\\n\\n\\n#Watch for Free Content\\n\\nThese are the events absolutely everyone can watch on the [Blizzard](https://www.twitch.tv/blizzard) or [Overwatch](https://www.twitch.tv/playoverwatch) twitch channel. Last year, Youtube streams were also set up in advance with a possibility to enable notifications for when they start ; so if you\\'re subscribed to the [PlayOverwatch youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClOf1XXinvZsy4wKPAkro2A), you can keep an eye out for these.\\n\\n**The Opening Ceremony (Nov. 2, 11AM PDT / 7PM CET)** : \\n\\nThis is the time where big reveals and news take place, so you definitely don\\'t want to miss it. Last time, all the new content for Overwatch was revealed during the OC. \\n\\nBe aware that it is not an Overwatch specific event, so there\\'s no telling when the game will be mentioned. Last year it did not went first, and this time it seems Diablo might be in the spotlight, so be patient.\\n\\nYou should also know that this will be for big reveals, but won\\'t have much details. Expect 2 minutes trailers with the Almighty Jeff to give the introductions, but detailed info on revealed content will be reserved for the What\\'s Next ? Panel that we will talk about in a second.\\n\\nBlizzcon releases have been pretty stable these last few years, so here are the things you can expect if they follow the pattern :\\n\\n- a new hero\\n-~~ a new map~~\\n- a new animated short\\n- an additional bonus. 2016 had the arcade, 2017 had skins. I\\'m personaly hoping for the recently pushed back social feature.\\n\\n**Streamers :**\\n\\nBlizzard usually invites some big members of the community to stream during the convention. The first extensive look at Sombra\\'s and Moira\\'s gameplay thus came from them. Devs also usually take questions and interviews from the streamers, giving you a nice inside look on the future content. Last year, i believe [Unit Lost](https://www.twitch.tv/unitlost) is the channel that got the earliest exclusive gameplay. [Seagull](https://www.twitch.tv/a_seagull) is also known for getting some quality Q&A time with the devs.\\n\\n\\n**The Overwatch World Cup (starting Nov. 2, 12PM PDT / 8PM CET)  :**\\n\\nYou can watch for free this final showdown of the best countries and players in the world, and I highly recommand doing so. Even if you\\'re not into eSports, cheering for your nation is much more fun than just watching two teams you have absolutely no connexion with.\\n\\nThe matches will be held in the Arena, which is the biggest eSport scene of the con, and start straight after the opening ceremony. The finals will be **On November 3 at 3:45PM PDT / 11:45PM CET**. ^Blizz ^plz ^stop ^fucking ^up ^my ^sleep\\n\\nThe eight remaining teams competing for the title of world champion, team compositions, and the detailed schedule of each match, can be found in this [article](https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/news/22569409/overwatch-world-cup-top-8-preview). Cool trick : Switching the language to your country at the bottom of the page will convert the shedule to your local timezone.\\n\\nThese events are to my knowledge the only ones you can watch for free. So now it\\'s time to talk about the virtual ticket.\\n\\n\\n\\n#Paid Events and Content\\n\\n\\n**The virtual ticket** :\\n\\nFirst and foremost, it costs around 45$ US / 39€  and you can buy one [here](https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/blizzcon-virtual-ticket).\\n\\nIt will grant you access to streaming of all the conferences, panels, and events of the convention subtitled in your language, plus some exclusive gear to buy, exclusive video, an early access to WoW classic... To that, you can add various in-game exclusive items including the [Demon Hunter Sombra legendary skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBkJ695ckok) for Overwatch. *(note : this skin has been confirmed to be available separately later in 2019 through other means that have yet to be disclosed)*\\n\\n\\n**Here\\'s a list of the Overwatch panels you can only watch with the Ticket :**\\n\\n- **Overwatch : what\\'s next (Nov. 3, 1:30PM PDT / 9:30PM CET)** : The most important one, where devs will give much more details about the upcoming content revealed during the Opening Ceremony.\\n\\n- **Artist at Work (Nov 3, 10:15AM PDT / 6:15PM CET) and Building a hero (Nov 3, 2:30PM PDT / 10:30PM CET)** : Making of panels who will probably dig into the new content and the work of the development team. The one from last year got released [on the official YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I7mqglIYLM) recently if you want to see what it looks like.\\n\\n- **Voices of Overwatch (Nov 3, 11:15AM PDT / 7:15PM CET)** : Voice actors panel. If you enjoy the VA\\'s work and how they interact with each other, this is the place to go. [Here\\'s the one from last year](https://youtu.be/_nFTCyMNqMw) if you want a preview (not an official source)\\n\\n\\nThat ends our list. On a side note, I believe you should know that not buying the ticket will not end up totally depriving you of the panels\\' content. This sub will obviously sum up and clip most of what will be said. Gaming news websites will make articles about the content discussed in the \"What\\'s next\" panel. And since we\\'re on the internet, the streams will probably be screencapped and reposted on Youtube Direct, or available later once people rip the VODs. Please note that these sources are of course not official and may be taken down ; I\\'m not inciting you to use them, I just want you to be aware of the options available. \\n\\n\\n\\n#Conclusion\\n\\n\\nI hope this guide was able to help some of you see more clearly through the whole convention stuff. Making this post using the one from last year as a template, it\\'s honestly a bit sad that there seems to be overall much less time dedicated to Overwatch during this edition. We went from 6 panels to a total of 4, and they seem to be shorter. Diablo is also going before overwatch this year for the \"What\\'s next\" panels, putting it right after the Opening Ceremony, which usually means it will get the biggest reveals. \\n\\nVeteran Blizzard fans, if I forgot anything, please let me know. I wish you all a great Blizzcon.\\n\\n#Edit\\n\\nFresh from the dev update ; no new map, and beta preview of an ingame spectator system for the WC\\n', 'comments': [\"HERO 29 will most likely be released on Monday, Nov 5th, on PTR.\\n\\nIt's been like this due the fact they don't want everyone paying attention to anything other than the World Cup. HERO 29 will be available to be played on Blizzcon though.\", 'Even though I\\'m hyped, I\\'m going in with realistic expectations.\\n\\n>Blizzcon releases have been pretty stable these last few years, so here are the things you can expect if they follow the pattern :\\n\\n>- a new hero\\n>- a new map\\n>- a new animated short\\n>- an additional bonus. 2016 had the arcade, 2017 had skins. I\\'m personaly hoping for the recently pushed back social feature.\\n\\nIf they \"only\" announce \"the usual\", cool, I won\\'t die mad. If they announce anything else I\\'ll be pleasantly surprised! But based on some recent threads in the sub this sadly won\\'t be enough for some people.\\n\\nI\\'d love it if Goodsmile announced the next wave of Overwatch Nendoroids, or that Blizzard does another \"lootbox update\" with more skins and we can finally have Shooting Star D.Va.', 'Dev update came out.

His family being very close of The Potter Family, Longbottom family,  and The Delacours but also close to  The Weasleys , The Abbotts,.The Greengrasses, The Prewetts, The Johnsons, The Ollivanders, The Diggorys, The Fawcetts, The Dumbledoors and The Scamanders. There would also be connections to the Tonks and Davis families for muggle businesses.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThey would be well-off, having a Manor (quite big in the inside) with a stable having  Abraxans (There may be a centaur taking care of the grounds and stable), a big house (specially inside) with maybe a shop at Hogsmeade, a summer house with a private beach in the south of France, a Bungalow in the pacific islands or in the Caribbeans on a small island hidden too (but multiple rooms for guests, indoor pool, with a crew of wizard (lifeguard, cook/barman and housekeeper) the bungalow being available to rent) and also in the Outer Hebrides a cottage which would be way bigger inside and the tiny island hidden with wards (made it that way by B after he came back of war in case of another one to be a safe haven),  a few well treated house elves (they were receiving money or like a credit with a goblin supervisor (who lives with his family) taking care of pecuniary punishments instead of physical (and there would be a elve tasked with making some decent clothings and having an elve shop, servants (wizard (mainly muggleborn or half-blood  and squib). They could also own several shops rented out (in Diagon, Hogsmeade and also other places) and rented accommodations too. They also own some farms to grow potion ingredients and potions labs, maybe some kind of reserve (one or several) having unicorns and dragons (and other animals/creatures) with selling things that are able to be sold (keeping the animal alive (unicorn horn maybe shedding) or when an animal dies naturally). They would also be into the import/export market.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe family have several investments in many schools with mainly a private Institute in Switzerland (similar to the Institut Le Rosey) in the Alps in a magic location where would there also be a 5 star magic hotel with a conference room where could have international trading and also either in the hotel or next to it the ICW quarters (Which would include a strike force), but also Hogwarts where B sits in the Board, the other schools are receiving only minor funding compared to the two. They also own the Daily Prophet (or a light side major alternative).\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe Intellectually gifted A born the same year as James, at first educated homeschooled by a squib teacher (C) or in a muggle school where C works (cousin or sibling of the B) (A could wear an anti-accident-magic charm). At home he self-taught himself wandless magic and the ability to sense magic.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nJoining Hogwarts, being sorted into Hufflepuff (He had a bit of every house’s quality, but friendliness was the biggest). He would be joining the Hufflepuff team, being in the Marauder group (he replaces Peter not existing here) but convincing James not to bully Snape. Becoming an Animagus (flying one), receiving a time turner in third year, making a second version of the Marauder map more interactive (the map being the middle and everything in x m/km would been shown maybe even not only humans (found out about the Basilisk). His years at Hogwarts would be outstanding. He also finds and destroys the DADA curse, maybe a horcrux was doing it. He also uses (since he learns all Hogwarts secrets) the chamber of requirement to make a room to trap Peeves.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThen wanting to learn more, A would travel the world, meeting tribes (learning about them, their relations to muggle cousins and so on) and the same with goblins, centaur, Merpeople, and similar intelligent races and visiting every school (even the minors ones) specially learning specialties like Castelobruxo for herbology and Magizoology, the dark arts and even learning how to defend against them in Durmstrang, Quidditch training in Mahoutokoro, No wand casting in Uagadou. He also studies some muggle things, especially weapons.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAfter returning to the UK joining the Aurors maybe being able to join as well the unspeakable. Also being some kind of consultant in a few departments (specially muggle related, other being relation and also international relations. He's also in the liaison team (where his wife (D) is also working in as well as in the muggle department and the special fund department) with the Prime minister (and maybe the Queen). D would be (either British/Irish (Gryffindor or Ravenclaw) or from another country (Canada, US, Kiwi, Aussi, First nation, Native American, Polynesians (mainly Maori), either way muggleborn). A and B would go do a full dentist check-up.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAt the start of the first war, the family home in the Outer Hebrides is used as a safe house (D pregnant being one of the occupant, she would give birth to a boy or a girl in 1980). He also convinced James to be the secret keeper, luring Tom in a trap bunker with a lot of muggle protection charmed and some muggle weapons and defeating Tom. He may have found out how to remove the masks. He destroyed the Horcruxes. Moves the philosophical stone to mount Everest on the top with multiple alert wards. He creates (or helps the creation of) the magic version of Interpol and hunted Fenrir Greyback.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhen judging the death eaters, he pushed with the help of others to have them scanned  and so making their argument kaput. They get sent to Azkaban. He could find a way to permanently track the prisoners and/or to have anti-polyjuice wards installed in Hogwarts and Azkaban. For all confirmed death eaters, their (spouse and any children) fortune, wealth and land seized and analysed (and some things may be destroyed) and put in the ministry hands (special department that would either sell or auction what can and use all the fund for a trust fund for muggleborn, squibs and half-breeds, Werewolf, poor witches (that could be also half or put blood (the Weasley being eligible) a part of the fund also goes to the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures that would be reorganised, it will also fund the department of blood curses) or if there is a member of the extended family innocent put in their hands with an unbreakable vow to not help the guilty family. Then the family would be placed into an apartment and receive a monthly pension and school expenses all played. The house elves are either going to the next head of house or depending on the physical are either going to Hogwarts, having a job in E’s domain, or finally going to a place they can rest and heal a bit before going back to one of the choices\\r  \\n\\r  \\nHe would also own a bunch of muggle housing to lodge squibs and even some squib dorms managed by adult squibs near muggle schools to allow them an education.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nHogwarts would open the doors to Werewolves and maybe other outcasts and Lupin would become the DADA teacher, The Outer Hebrides safe house being available during full moon.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nA also receives the title of Order of Merlin, First Class like his father. And with that joining the Wizengamot (in the First Class seats) with his father being in the head of house seat. He knows and doesn't keep it a secret that Umbridge is lying about her family heritage. Kingsley Shacklebolt becomes the Minister of Magic, Amelia Bones head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Alastor Moody head of Aurors. Sirius and Dora Tonks as Aurors being a senior and junior team.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nHe pushes for the transformation of Azkaban. Finding a way to get rid of Dementors, Having a huge wall and a magic impassable invisible roof, placing a no-magic ward all around. Having inside that perimeter squibs and muggles (who are permanently stationed there until they choose to quit (big pay then and a few memories altered with a fake muggle max sec prison. Having between both set of walls Aurors patrolling. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nAfter a few years working at the Ministry. They quit their ministry jobs (he would still be an inactive auror member and they would still be in the liaison team with the Minister and Royal but without the briefings) and join Hogwarts. D if she didn't attend Hogwarts would find the sorting of the hat weird (cunning in Slytherin etc).\\r  \\n\\r  \\nEven if he could teach any subject he would teach, Xylomancy, Field Studies, Ghoul Studies, Magic Theory, Ancient Studies, World Magic Studies (which include learning about tribes and cultures), he would also teach defence against muggle weapons. D would teach Muggle studies, Muggle Art, Muggle Music. They would be joined by the daughter muggle of C that would give kids some basic muggle subjects (writing, English, maths at least). Lily Potter would teach History of Magic.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe three of them would create a muggleborn support group (that could incorporated more people if the need arise) where muggleborn and their family would know about what was needed to know and presented Diagon alley, The Bank, St Mungo, The Magic Bus, Newspapers, law firm of Lawmaster Gripsack and Twist (Their office owned by A’s family) where to meet at the station and also meeting a few older muggleborn students that would when the time comes to go to school help them at the Station. They would instore a writing activity the week-end for anyone with priority to first year muggleborn (but not excluding other first years), they would task older muggleborn students (who wouldn't be in n.e.w.t and o.w.l years) to make it easier since they wouldn’t see the older students as professors during that moment and so feeling more open when writing, showing those without owls the owl tower. He would also give them a phone number of a Squib that could send owls in case of an issue even if they could send mail through the muggle mail service.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThen it's time for their kid (E) to go to Hogwarts with Harry (they are like siblings since their parents were like brothers, part of the Marauders), Ron (A would also be quite close to Arthur Weasley sharing the interest of muggle things), Neville (with his mother being Harry’s godmother). They would meet Dan Emma and Hermione during the Muggleborn day where they would have them make the shopping during that day (two birds one stone), Ginny and the rest of the still schooled Weasley kids would also be there. Their kid would buy a male snowy owl, there is also Susan Bones since they are close to Amilia, him working as an (now inactive) Auror. Everyone would eat either at the Leaky Cauldron or The family owned restaurant (the more casual one)  in Diagon Alley.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nA would make his duty to meet parents of nearly all students. He would become specially close to The Patils, The Moons, The Changs, The Browns, The Perks\\r  \\n\\r  \\nA would have owned and opened a few restaurants muggle and magic ones (having a magic executive chef and a muggle executive chef. There would be restaurants in the UK and in France, both with muggle and magic ones (the upper ones being like Gordon Ramesy style). A is also planning to buy other magical restaurants in other places. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nE and the others who meet at Diagon are travelling together or in a few compartments if needed (with E, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Susan, Neville in one compartment) There's also Daphne Greengrass, her family being quite close of E’s family, A also interested by the blood curse of her sister, offered accommodation near where blood curse could be looked after. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhen the sorting of the hat comes everyone goes to their respective houses, E goes to Hufflepuff (and if D went to Hogwarts loses the bet to her husband (each one betting that E would go in their respective houses). At one-point Dumbledor retires and marries his boyfriend and Mrs McGonagall takes over. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nDraco isn't the usual bully, he was in a small group of mostly Slytherins but they were together mostly ashamed to go to others since they’re part of children of destitute death-eaters. Snape is just a teacher like others strict but just (not holding a grudge since he wasn't bullied), Lily finds him someone (it was always clear that they would be just friends and Snape never said to her mudblood), maybe Narcissa.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nOne year later, Ginny and Luna arrive at the school. Luna also being a close connection to the family since A paid a few adverts in the Quibbler and asked to cover different things. A would pay attention to Luna’s possessions disappearing.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nEither Cedric or Fleur would win the Triwizard tournament. (No 4th contestant).\\r  \\n\\r  \\nA and the rest of the Marauders invest in the twins' enterprise.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nE either falls in love with Fleur or a muggleborn woman in E’s year.\\r  \\nHarry with Hermione\\r  \\nRon with Lavender Brown\\r  \\nGinny with Colin Creevey (first met during the muggleborn orientation day)\\r  \\nDaphne Greengrass with Tracey Davis\\r  \\nLuna with Rolf Scamander\\r  \\nThe Patil sisters one with Lily Moon and the other one with Sally-Anne Perks\\r  \\nCedric Digory with Cho Chang\\r  \\nSeamus Finnigan with \\r  \\nDean Thomas with \\r  \\nViktor Krum with\\r\\n\\nThen there could be a lot of content added after\\r  \\n\\r  \\n(There could even be a royal connexion Zara Phillips and younger Mike Tindall)\\r  \\n\\r  \\n\", 'comments': []}]"
