It inspired me to look forward to the ship & crew gameplay loop even 10 years later.\\n\\nMost of you probably aren\\'t familiar with the  [Puzzle Pirates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/99910/Puzzle_Pirates/) MMO. It\\'s nearly dead today, but let me walk you through what it felt like to jump into the pirate world. Every one of the bullets above is checked off with flying colors.\\n\\nTo be clear, this is not at all to suggest that any of the following mechanics should translate literally to Star Citizen. It\\'s the underlying concepts that I intend to highlight.\\n\\n# The first pillage\\n\\nFinding a ship currently hiring is easy:\\n\\n>The \"[Voyages](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Configure_voyage)\" tab displays a list of [ships](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Ship) at sea (if any) that are hiring [jobbers](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Jobber) for various voyages. All voyages show the ship, crew, and [officer](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Officer) name (with clickable links to [/vwho](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Vwho), [crew](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Info#crew), and [pirate](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Info#pirate) info pages respectively), and a button to apply. Pirates may also \"auto-apply\" to voyage types of their choosing.\\n\\nThis means any captain, without needing friends online or a crew can easily find you, the new player looking to earn some money in the game.\\n\\n[\\\\\\\\\"Notice Board\\\\\\\\\" \\\\(pictured right\\\\) makes it easy to find ships at or near your current island looking for crew.](https://preview.redd.it/5c3plkoeo2571.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=068f4110df95674d54bc3a0ebece37514ecce680)\\n\\nOnce on board, the captain asks you to do a job, or you pick one.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4atr723ho2571.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b502d4b14b1c7b00070789045dea520e2c52035d\\n\\nEach job involves skill, and the better you get, the faster you make resources available to the ship. You don\\'t just run around with an engineering tool and click on sparking engines, there\\'s a gameplay challenge involved, giving you a fun and perhaps urgent challenge to overcome.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2fivmsmo2571.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=269c2aa225398085b38ee000a23a1742a70ea64d\\n\\nDuring the voyage, your hard work and good performance is visible to the captain and everyone else.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7h66vv6to2571.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb05dff80337f1cc185450452bfae7ace00bbc3e\\n\\nAnd once the cargo is hauled, or the piracy is done, or the navy mission is complete, you receive your cut of the loots / profits based on how long you were there and depending on the distribution settings, potentially your rank in the crew, whether that be jobber, crew member, officer, or captain. You\\'re given some reward immediately after each mission / battle, but largely the winnings are kept for division until the end of the voyage to incentivize crew to stay to the end.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/of4ztwxoo2571.png?width=799&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad810e8d8d06837627dd1fa3cb9ba485e8ce29bc\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFinally, you\\'ve been paid your share of that sweet loot, you\\'re progressing in the game. But one day you want to have your own ship that you can bring out, hire a crew, and transport cargo to sell or hunt down other merchants, or fight pirates and lead the voyage.\\n\\n# Progression\\n\\nThe officer in charge of the voyage notices you did well and invites you to join the crew. He\\'s not the captain, but he still gets to lead voyages. You accept his invitation and plan to work your way to that position.\\n\\nOr rather, perhaps you\\'ll become that senior officer that doesn\\'t often lead voyages, but prefers to just be one of the best in the crew or even world at one of the important jobs on a ship.\\n\\n[A bigger ship lead by the captain of your crew.](https://preview.redd.it/ge025kvvo2571.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=feec6101c93c4ef10c4aed383c2863eb0431e55b)\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to worry whether the social structure of your organization will dictate who can and can\\'t lead voyages. If you\\'ve got a ship, you can take it out, and depending on your rank, you can take out larger ships owned by the crew too. But leading the voyage is stressful, and you realize that the months spent earning your way to owning bigger ships are just as fun as once you get there.\\n\\n# Waiting for crew\\n\\nAnyone who\\'s ever been in a multiplayer lobby know that inevitably as the lobby takes longer to fill, people leave, and sometimes this causes a chain reaction and the whole process has to restart.\\n\\nIn Puzzle Pirates, a small less-skilled AI crew immediately show up to fill however many slots the captain chooses to leave open at departure. This crew is pretty decent at basic tasks, sometimes even better than players, but always struggle at any sort of combat.\\n\\nAlso, ships are fully customizable and captains can place card and game tables on board, which let people play with any other players on the docked island.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyxe3npyo2571.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d76f52e58a0f5f4a09bebe81e747ca3fc40350e0\\n\\n# Star Citizen multi-crew ship hiring mechanics\\n\\nI hope that SC implements systems like this to allow ease of crewing a medium or large ship so that players don\\'t have to have a friend group that plays or rely on a Discord or Organization to crew their ship. The reason many solo-players play solo is because they don\\'t want to be under the social structure of a group with leaders who tell them what to do. Someone should be able to crew a ship independently of an organization allowing it, or having 4-5 IRL friends who play the game at the same hours.\\n\\nThe different jobs on the ship should be fun and rewarding, and others should be able to see how well you\\'re doing (or not doing). I\\'m not saying repairing an engine needs to be a full-on minigame, but some skill being involved wouldn\\'t hurt as opposed to running around the ship holding LMB on components.\\n\\nPerhaps the ship\\'s computer can track a log of who fixed what and stats of damage dished out by each person manning turrets and the AI crew. Real players should probably have a bit of a performance advantage and it should be visible in the stats. This menu should be focused as an end-of-voyage alert where people\\'s performance, time on board, cargo carried, cargo gained, ships disabled, damage deal, and pay division are visible. This gives everyone a sense of accomplishment and people are more likely to stay to the end to make sure they\\'re given the full share of the rewards.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve manned a turret in SC you know the line of sight (LOS) is often terrible and the target is not in view 70% of the time. Larger ships should allow players in gunnery stations to virtually man various turrets around the ship, and swap to relevant ones with ease, letting the AI and blades take over where the players left off.\\n\\nThere need to be missions that pay well enough to make everyone feel a real sense of progress toward one day owning their own ship. Crewing frigates should be a viable and effective way to earn enough to buy your own multi-crew ship just as quickly as running cargo or doing solo missions.\\n\\nThere needs to be a seamless profit sharing system for selling loot. It should include ships who sign up to escort. Everyone involved in any team-effort voyage should be compensated seamlessly by a built-in system.\\n\\nFor wait times on ships big enough to have the problem, recreational stations should be considered. There\\'s no reason, for example, the Pool table on the Polaris can\\'t be functional and offer a futuristic pool experience perhaps with holographic path projection on the table. This kind of  recreational and cosmetic customization on a ship would be far more profitable for CIG than anything in the Verse barring ship sales and it\\'s one of the most ethical and popular forms of micro-transaction.\\n\\nIt may be difficult and time consuming to crew a large voyage with the occupants of one port alone. A concept I\\'ve seen referred to as the [Agent Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Smith) mechanic could allow stations at all ports that allow players to enter a pod and take control of an NPC serving as crew on a remote ship. When you go AFK for pizza / family reasons, the NPC can temporarily take over (or permanently if you\\'re gone too long). Pay a small UEC fee per minute for the pod\\'s usage (incentivizing people to try to physically crew ships when possible to make the pods less crowded).\\n\\nPerhaps an inverse mechanic could be used for touring, where players can *pay the ship* for tourist slots on space yachts touring beautiful location in the Verse. The same yacht might have a separate jobber offer open for crew defending the ship, while others pay to be guests, all from remote VR pods.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t8ciq3tzo2571.jpg?width=780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=670268f593c1a3a37bb4b6688f58968562716c3d\\n\\nStar Citizen\\'s crew jobs are limited, largely fixing broken components and manning turrets that often don\\'t have an LOS to the target. These jobs are fine for AI, but they\\'ll need a lot of care and creativity to make them fun enough for players to enjoy the being-a-crew-member aspect of Star Citizen. It is doable, but if CIG doesn\\'t deliver, the community should push for these innovations because it will make this game live much longer and meet its full potential', 'comments': [\"Well written, and I agree with many of your points.\\nRight now CIG seems to not be designing most of the gameplay with multi-crew in mind, so I can se a lot of fundamental stuff needing to be put in place before it'll even be fun, let alone practical.\\n\\nUnfortunately you may have also sold me on this Puzzle Pirates MMO.\", \"Lots of good info there.\\n\\nI remember similar debates wayyy back in the early days of MMO's and there was this idea that nobody would want to be the healer, it was boring they said. But here we are years later and we now know there is a huge player base out there that loves that kind of stuff.\\n\\nPersonally I find Mining about as exciting as watching grass grow, yet there are millions of players who love it. So I'm not too worried about roles being filled in SC.\\n\\nPlayers like to live out their fantasies in MMOs so we're going to see everything from space farmers to journalists in SC. The real issue is how fun each role is, not the roles themselves.\\n\\nThat's why I'm more interested in the mini-games each profession has. If they're fun and engaging then we won't have any trouble filling crew spots. There will be something for everyone. \\n\\nThe job boards is the other key here. I would much rather have a human crew because it's more effective. So much depends on the structure of the job boards, how easy it is to use.\\n\\nI am a little concerned with someone on my crew deciding they need to bail suddenly. But since the job boards allow us to post a rating with notes people like that won't find any work after awhile.\\n\\nI'm not too worried about travel because in DAOC we had the same situation and had to travel by horse to meet up with our group. Sometimes it took up to 15 min just on horse then there was some running involved, but people worked it out.\\n\\nLet's hope the same will happen in SC.\", 'I think the biggest challenge is going to be finding crew you want to let onto your pride and joy, full of prized possessions what are anywhere near you. Server meshing aside, the verse is big and without fast travel putting together a credit of say 10 could mean travelling a lot.\\n\\nMulti crew may be effectively gatekept by being in a decent sized org and having to arrange it all. Then you have the issue of people leaving half way through a mission because nobody wants to sit on the bench.\\n\\nDead time in SC is a serious issue. They need this \"agent smithing\" or fast travel. Realism isn\\'t particularly fun', 'Down time is an obvious and easy one.  Let the crew practice what players actually enjoy *and pledged for* with in-game AR video game training.\\n\\nArena Commander is an in-universe game, right?  Use it for training in between fights.  Let there be purchasable AC software and additional hardware customized to each ship for the captain to tell a ship\\'s computer run a simulated battle so the crew can practice their role at their station.  Weapons and engines are safed but the crew\\'s experience is just like they would have in actual combat.  Have the gunfire displayed through their AR contacts or something.\\n\\nHammerhead is on a long quantum jump on the way to rearm or whatever?  Load up the training soft and simulate an interdiction ambush by a bunch of pirates looking to trade up.  Polaris crew practices keeping the ship intact while a bunch of Vanduul are trying to bring it down with concentrated fire.\\n\\nHeck, if it\\'s done well enough the crew won\\'t be sure they aren\\'t in a real fight, if not for the lack of G-forces.  The captain can run it as surprise drills to keep the crew on their toes and their skills sharp.  \\n\\n*\"Oh noooo guys our Cat loaded with drugs just got pulled out of Quantum by the cops!  Take \\'em down before they shoot out the engines! I\\'m not going back to Space Jail!\"*', \"Play Sea Of Thieves, people are happy to be crew.\\n\\nFor big ships in SC I don't want to own one or captain one, am happy to help out.\"]}, {'title': 'Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates', 'subreddit': 'MMORPG', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/54g68m/yohoho_puzzle_pirates/', 'selftext': 'Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates is a MMO game and the player takes the role of a pirate, adventuring on the high seas and pillaging pieces of eight (Currency for Money) from roaming enemy ships. The mechanics of Puzzle Pirates are driven by puzzles. For example, to effectively sail a ship, players must play puzzle games representing work at the sails for speed, pumping bilge water to remove it from the ship, and carpentry to fix any damage the ship may take etc. There are also parlor games such as Sword fighting, Brawling, Poker, Spades, Hearts and more! Despite it being an old online game, the graphics are not all that bad and still has a beating player base but it would be more awesome if it had more.

There were lot's of player and OM run events in the forums and my crew and alliance were both always running parley games tournaments.\\n\\nI really like their F2P model. You could buy things like badges, for example, that open up different parts of the game and then days only ticked down when you logged in.\\n\\nIf/when I go back to play, I'd have to play on the sub server, since that is were I started.
