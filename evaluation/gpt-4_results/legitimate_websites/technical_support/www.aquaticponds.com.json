Algae leaves spores that do the same.', 'Depends on the aquatic creature. \\n\\nSome animals, like certain species of fish and amphibians go into a hibernation or suspended animation state in a little \"cocoon\" they make out of mucus and mud and bury themselves in the mud. When the pond gets filled again, the cocoon dissolves and they emerge again.\\n\\nMany insects lay eggs and die, when the pond fills again the eggs hatch and the cycle begins again. \\n\\nOthers migrate to other water sources, and maybe move around when the rivers are full and/or flood.', 'Life, uh, finds a way.\\n\\nEggs can hitch rides on other animals. For instance. birds walk around the edge of one pond with animals in it, get the sticky eggs of frogs and fish on its feet, then fly to the new pond and search for food there. Some eggs can just survive deep in the mud until the pond refills.  Flooding can carry fish and eggs to the pond as well.', 'I know this doesn\\'t exactly answer your question, because it\\'s not addressing ponds that have *completely* dried up, but I think it\\'s relevant and really neat. \\n\\nIn the Everglades alligators are the reason most species are able to survive the dry season. This is because of what is commonly known as \"Gator Pits\". They dig out large pits in existing bodies of water which are deep enough to hold water throughout the dry season. This gives the animals in the area a crucially important (though greatly diminished from the wet season) water source. If it were not for the alligators, the delicate ecosystem that is the Everglades would quickly collapse (or at least suffer a dramatic change wherein many species go extinct). Alligators are the Kings and Stewards of the Everglades.', \"From a fish and wild life class I took there are 3 ways\\n\\n1.) Some life just buries itself in the mud and goes dormant, or some eggs just don't hatch until the conditions are right.\\n\\n2.) Ducks and other more mobile animals will spread it around. Fish eggs get stuck to their feet and then fall off in the new pond.\\n\\n3.) This is actually probable the most used but lots of ponds are really part of a water shed, a piece of land that shares the same drainage system. In normal levels of water they are un-connected lakes and ponds.\\n\\nHowever when the system is flush with water maybe during spring snow melt or it just rains a lot, all the ponds, lakes , streams actually become connected by small streams. These streams connect the otherwise unconnected ponds with the bigger lakes and rivers.\"]}, {'title': 'Why is it that fish or other aquatic life can suddenly appear in secluded ponds or lakes?', 'subreddit': 'askscience', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1xed4w/why_is_it_that_fish_or_other_aquatic_life_can/', 'selftext': \"My friends dad is a landscaper and he recently made a 2 acre pond.
