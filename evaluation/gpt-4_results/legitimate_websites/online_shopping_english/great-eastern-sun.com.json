Follow Rachel R. Send Message Share Review “ Great Quality, Fast Shipping ” March 29th, 2024 At first I was a little leary of this site. I couldn't find any reviews and the prices seemed a little too good to be true, especially for the miso paste. I am so glad that I bit the bullet and placed an order! The food arrived packaged carefully and promptly (I am on the other side of the country, it shipped Monday and arrived Friday). The miso paste is undamaged and went straight into the fridge! I am sipping the tea now and am going to enjoy these noodles a little later. 10/10 would recommend. I will absolutely be ordering from here again!

It's super healthy and great for snacks by itself or with a Japanese/sushi inspired meal. AND you can buy it in bulk through their website, which is much cheaper than getting it at Whole Foods or one of those ripoff stores. Impress your friends and get some healthy seaweed!
