So here are 4 articles I found on medieval hygiene which cite both primary sources and books written by historians. \\n\\nKeep in mind that since the beginning of the 13th century cities (I am mainly talking about France and England) had access to running water which came into the city via underground aqueducts.

Hygiene practices in Scandinavia were different than in France and Italy, mainly due to the long winters and cold weather. That’s why even baptism could be a health danger', 'I think one of the biggest things that impact discussions about hygiene and fresh water supplies was the issue of ‘who is paying for this’?\\nLike I was recently researching the supply of fresh water in London in the early part of the 13th Century (as historical cul-de-sacs go it’s pretty forlorn I must admit)…\\n\\nThere seem to be several things happening around the mid 1230’s… we know there was a large royal wedding (Henry III’s) and as such a special mention was made by Matthew Paris of how London specifically went about cleaning the streets of the copious amounts of… ‘rubbish’ (read *excrement*) in the preparations.  We also know that the public toilet down at Queenhithe which had been around since the reign of Henry I (located by the docks as waste products were easier to dispose of IN the river) was in a poor state of disrepair, and we ALSO know that there was a heck of a drought impacting England…\\n\\nAs such we FINALLY see the ‘powers that be’ in London (today we’d say oligarchs, Victorians would say the patrician class, but the contemporary description I use is ‘eschavins’) spend some money on the problems.  The Aldermen of London (from which was still selected mostly members of this class) were parsimonious when it came to spending money on things like improving water supplies, but these factors all combined.\\n\\nSo, they spent money clearing the streets, revamped and cleaned up the public privy and then gained permission and paid for fresh water to be pumped from the spring/source of the River Tyburn.  Nowadays that is located under the streets near Oxford Street, but back then it was out in the countryside to the west of the city.  Water was pumped from that, across some fields, along Fleetbridge (aka Fleet Street), past the headquarters of Knight’s Templar, and then across the river Fleet, through the wall just above Ludgate and then inside the city, to the north of St. Paul’s cathedral and onto West Cepe (aka Cheapside).\\n\\nThis was a tough project- conveying the water over the Fleet river valley was difficult and the pipes in that region needed repair within twenty years.\\n\\nBut we can see a real case of cause and effect in this- fresh water/better water supplies were driven by factors other than hygiene.  Hence why the eschavins were grudgingly willing to spend some money on it.  But it is worth noting that about a decade later a much larger project for fresh water was supplied to the city.  If anyone IS interested, I actually mention this in a recent edition of a podcast on this subject [here](https://rss.com/podcasts/storyoflondon/1420438/) but yeah. The process of improving water supplies and hygiene is a really interesting one.', 'Along similar lines but for an earlier time period (100 BCE to 100 CE), Jodi Magness, a scholar at UNC Chapel Hill, wrote the following:\\n\\nMagness, Jodi.  *Stone and Dung, Oil and Spit: Jewish Daily Life in the Time of Jesus*.

Firstly, the resources and primary sources that come to us are coming from the educated class, so the clergy and the educated wealthy. Literacy in the Middle ages would have been less than 5% (educated guess, irony intended) so the vast majority of people, rural dwelling farm workers in the main, would not have practised the same hygiene rituals.

I could hear the nearby thrumming of speakers at a dorm party. It triggered a deep nostalgia for my own undergrad Saturday nights spent listening to people gathered at nearby parties.\\n\\n“You know it’s taking a clandestine tour of New England, right?” Jim wheezed. The speed of our walk was much harder on him than it was on me. “They don’t announce when it’s moving, and *very* few people even know that it’s left the British Museum. Anyway, it’s Brown’s turn next week, and *voila,* the idiots showed up on our doorstep early with no announcement and even less fanfare.”\\n\\n“Idiots?” I asked incredulously.\\n\\nHe stepped in front of me and stopped walking for dramatic effect, but seemed glad for the opportunity to catch his breath. “What else do you call people who drop one of the most important artifacts in the history of your field?”\\n\\nI tried to swallow, but my throat was parched. “Just how badly is cracked? Is an entire piece missing?”\\n\\nHis eyes seemed to sink into his skull. “You’re not understanding,” he explained in a low tone. The cool night air ruffled his receding hairline, but he remained frozen in place. “It’s split down the middle.”\\n\\nMy stomach dropped. “They cracked it in *half?*”\\n\\n“Yes,” Jim responded gravely as we turned around and continued under Wayland Arch, “But you don’t realize *which* half.”\\n\\nI wanted to cry. “Does it *matter?* The Rosetta Stone is one of the most significant pieces-”\\n\\n“Oh, Francis,” Jim continued as he ran a hand through his graying hair, “You have *no idea.*”\\n\\n*\\n\\nI could tell that something was wrong when we went underground. Why the hell would the Rosetta Stone be hidden in a basement?\\n\\nI had worked at Brown for nine years, but the forgotten door at the end of a forgotten hallway in the Geo-Chem Building had never seemed important to me.\\n\\nWe had been enjoying the wonderful 48 hours between “terrible New England winter” and “awful New England summer.” But when I stepped down those stairs, a chill crept under my tweed blazer, latched onto my skin, and took up residence there for the duration of my time underground. \\n\\nThe sterile room we entered did nothing to assuage that chill. Nor did the silent, pale woman who stood next to the table in the center.\\n\\nThe man in the corner wearing sunglasses comforted me even less. He might have been looking at me. I didn’t know.\\n\\nBut my mind was quickly preoccupied with what lay on the table. \\n\\nA lifetime of academia had instilled in me a near-holy reverence of certain objects. I’d almost drooled over a Gutenberg Bible in the Huntington Library outside Los Angeles, and had spent 30 minutes frozen in place when I saw the Book of Kells as an undergrad living in Dublin. Witnessing the Rosetta Stone would have been a spiritual experience if it were not for the horror of its condition.\\n\\nMy head swam as I absorbed the extent of the damage. It had cracked so that its front face had separated from its back face, resulting in two thinner facsimiles of the original.\\n\\n“What have you done?” I whispered.\\n\\n“Professor Francis Nelson?” The pale woman asked sharply. I nodded in a daze. “You can read fluent Ancient Egyptian – both hieroglyphic and Demotic scripts – in addition to Ancient Greek, correct?”\\n\\nI nodded, then shook my head. “It’s – it’s already been translated, nearly two centuries ago. You don’t need me to-” \\n\\n“We need you to explain what’s inside,” she continued forcefully.\\n\\n“What’s – what’s inside *what?*” I responded in confusion.\\n\\nShe pointed. I leaned forward.\\n\\nThe inside of the Stone was now exposed to the outside world for the first time, I presumed, since the granodiorite rock was formed by underground magma millions of years ago. \\n\\nSo I had no idea how I was looking at an inscription that had been written *inside* the Rosetta Stone.\\n\\n“Do you understand it?” the pale woman continued. \\n\\nI stared at the words in front of me. Vertigo threated to render me unconscious. “Of course I do,” I responded with a trembling breath.\\n\\n“It’s written in Modern English.”\\n\\n“That’s-”\\n\\n“Impossible,” I cut Jim off. “Because the Rosetta Stone was carved two millenia ago, but Modern English is only five centuries old.”\\n\\n“No,” the pale woman continued urgently, “Do you understand what’s written?” \\n\\nSlack-jawed, I stared back down and began to read the message that could not possibly have been there. \\n\\nI read. I understood. \\n\\nI struggled to breathe.\\n\\nI snapped my head to the pale woman, then to the man in the corner, then back to Jim. \\n\\n“It says,” I explained in a trembling voice, “That ‘We will return in 2,217 years, for that will be the end.’”\\n\\n“And?” Jim asked darkly.\\n\\n“And,” I continued through ragged breaths, “I can tell you that the Rosetta Stone was carved [2,216 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/).”\\n\\n-----------\\n\\n[Part 2](https://redd.it/eihqhk)\\n\\n-----------\\n\\n[BD](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/)\\n\\n\\n[Listen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ?view_as=subscriber)', 'comments': ['Ok, cool.
