The gas discharge display on the radio is failing (a couple of segments are dead or dying; \"is that a 5 or a 6?\"), and the CDI lens is cloudy AF when illuminated at night (but it works, and you can see the needles well enough). I can get around the issues for now (toggle between standby and active to see what the frequency is...), but it\\'s not ideal, and aesthetically it looks like shit.\\n\\nI also have a GNS430W hooked up to a gorgeous, pristine [GI-106](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/552213).\\n\\nI\\'m watching the avionics market towards glass panel options; probably Aspen PFD 1000 Pro or, hopefully, Dynon Skyview HDX. (Want an updated autopilot and newer tech engine monitoring as well. Have an S-Tec 30 with altitude hold, a [FS-450](https://www.jpinstruments.com/shop/fuel-scan-450/), and an [EDM-700](https://www.jpinstruments.com/shop/edm-700/).)\\n\\nI believe the SL30 and GNC255 will talk directly to modern EFIS / PFD systems, but if I recall correctly, the older KX-155 (etc) \"analog\" systems will require a ~$2300 analog interface module to tie into the Aspen. (Not sure about the Dynon, but I suspect it will require similar accommodation, if it works at all.)\\n\\nLooks like my options are:\\n\\n* [LED display replacement](https://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/BendixKing-KX155165-Radio-Obsolete-Display-Creates-Refurb-Program-226685-1.html) through Bendix/King ($1750+), which still leaves me with a fugly CDI and the analog issues.\\n\\n* The [TKM KX-155 slide-in replacement](https://www.flyingmag.com/tkm-avionics-introduces-slide-in-replacement-for-king-kx-155-165) ($3000?), which is AFAIK still vaporware, TKM doesn\\'t have the best reputation for longevity, and still leaves me with the CDI/analog interface issues.\\n\\n* Living with the KX-155 for now and putting in an SL30 ($3000ish for the radio, used, plus install) or gorgeous and advanced [GNC255](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/102764) (<$4000 for the radio, brand new, plus install) when I do the glass upgrade. The GI-106 will become redundant (and in fact, at least with the Aspen, prohibited), so it can be repurposed to the new radio.\\n\\nThe last option clearly makes the most sense (once the glass panel is factored in, the costs are the same), but means living with the KX-155 for probably at least a year more. :/ I really only use it for ATIS and identifying intersections etc. when on VOR-only IFR segments (so, not really much, since I have the GNS430W as well), so it\\'s not exactly critical...\\n\\nWWYD?', 'comments': [\"The KX-155 is still a useful navcomm, but if you intend to replace it in the near term, it's not cost-effective to refurbish it, especially if it's just a backup navcomm.\\n\\nFWIW, I sent one out for the LEDs and front lens replacement. It looks great now and no regrets, but we weren't planning to replace it any time soon.\\n\\nI looked at the TKM replacement, but personally I think the UX is a hot mess. Check out the demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smQioX5gF-c\", \"I gave that TKM KX-155 a fingerpoke at Sun N fun. I'll just say this it looks great and is very light but you should not have to ask how to change the frequency on something that is a drop in replacement.\\n\\nFor some reason the frequency swap function is a small part of the touch screen rather than a button (The use of a touch screen rather than physical buttons seems really forced). They also only have a single knob so your muscle memory of inner and outer knobs is useless.\\n\\nJust deal with it until you have some other reason to replace the CDI.\", 'I’ve seen a few KX-155s go for around $700 for perfectly working units pulled for an upgrade.  Or check around, a unit checked out and with an 8130-3 might be twice that.  Still cheaper than an upgrade, especially if you’re just using it short term until a proper upgrade can be done.', \"I just went through a similar issue, but my KX155 the entire display would cut out.  I bought a used one for $750 (non Glide Slope Model) and my A&P did a log book entry for the replacement.  I'm trying to put as little money in the panel as possible waiting on the SkyView HDX to be available for the Bonanza.\\n\\nLast I talked to TKM the initial lot of 155 replacements would not be TSO'd, and they are pretty expensive for what they are.\", \"I'm also holding off replacing an old NARCO while waiting for the Skyview HDX package to get fully approved. \\n\\nI really wish Dynon had a NAV/COM that would integrate into the Skyview HDX system, but that's not happening. \\n\\nDynon recommended I score a used SL30, if I can find one, but it's not that much cheaper than the new GNC255 from Garmin. I like the compact form factor of the SL30, though I'm finding it hard to come by. Apparently I'm not the only one who wants one. \\n\\nOne thing I haven't sorted out: If I get a GNC255 or SL30, do I need to get a CDI for it, or will that run through the Skyview system?\\n\\nI most commonly use the secondary NAV radio to track an ILS frequency while the GPS gives me the major approach guidance. That way I know when I'm picking up the ILS without toggling the 430W back and forth from GPS to NAV mode. If I were to have to go missed, I've already got the GPS cued up and ready to move to the missed approach point.\"]}]"
