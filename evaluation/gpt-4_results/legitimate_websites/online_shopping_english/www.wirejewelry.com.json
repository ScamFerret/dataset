Thanks in advance all.\", 'comments': ['Lortone and thumlers are the 2 brands that still exist from the original rock polishing boom in the 50s/60s. They started with metal paint can looking barrels, then changed to a rubber liner to help dull the noise and then made full rubber barrels. Both brands are “forever fixes” which generally as long as the parts are made for that specific tumbler you can purchase every part and fix the tumbler. I purchased an old lortone 45c and a thumlers ar2 both from like the 60s and they ran perfectly (I did replace a few parts just for my own sake it was needed though).\\n\\nIn terms of durability and the longevity I would look out for either a thumlers ar2 (dual 3 pound barrel) or a lortone 33b. I would check Facebook marketplace or eBay for good deals on either of them. You’ll get a better deal on thumlers though because the barrel design is…meh…workable but has issues compared to lortone barrels. \\n\\nIf you want brand new then the Chicago electric is probably the way to go. Get the extended warranty because they do have issues.', 'If you have to buy an extended warranty on the tumbler, save your money. Rock tumbling as a hobby is not inexpensive. You buy the tumbler and you have to keep buying grit, pay for electricity etc. And here is a bit of advice for a newbie, do not clean your tumbler out in any of your household sinks. Take it outside and use your hose. Tumbling/polishing media will harden in your pipes like concrete. \\nI have two Lortone 45c tumblers. If you take care of them they will last effectively forever for you. They cost a bit more in the beginning, but the quality, quietness with which they run will make any money you spend on them well worth it. Rock tumblers are like anything else, you get what you pay for.', '[deleted]', 'Or if anyone knows of any cheaper to run durable tumblers that are not on the list and are under 105.00 Links would be awesome!', \"If you go with the Harbor Freight (Chicago Electric) make sure you get the 2yr warranty. It's low quality and will break down. I have two, but I know they will fail at some point.\"]}]"
