        "thought": "The extracted text from the website mentions a legitimate-sounding company name, TruTech Tools, Ltd., and provides a range of products that are specific to the HVAC industry. There is also mention of customer service contact information, shipping information, and various categories of products. There are no immediately apparent signs of unusually low prices or unrealistic claims of money. Additionally, the presence of a physical address and phone number is a good sign, but these need to be verified. To further assess the website's legitimacy, I should check the domain registration details.",
