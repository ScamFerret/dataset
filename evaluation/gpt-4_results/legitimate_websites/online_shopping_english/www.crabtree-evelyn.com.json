However, other sources such as Trustpilot show positive customer experiences, praising customer service and product quality. The presence of both positive and negative reviews is typical for most businesses and does not necessarily indicate a scam. I have gathered quite a bit of information so far and none of it strongly suggests that the website is a scam. The WHOIS information is consistent and shows a long-standing domain presence, and while there is a mixed bag of reviews, this is common for many businesses. Based on the information available and the lack of strong indicators of a scam according to the characteristics provided, I now know the final answer. The URL https://www.crabtree-evelyn.com/ does not appear to be a scam website.",
