I got an email a few days ago advertising a \"free 3 week trial\" of their site, which I was interested in. To start the trial, I had to sign up and enter my credit card details since they have membership set to auto-renew after the 3-week trial ends, this is pretty standard and what I was expecting, so I entered my details. On that page they had a note saying \"Cancel free anytime\". \\n\\nSo I get signed up and begin a few cooking school classes. I also just wanted to check how to cancel the auto-renew in case I didnt feel like paying at the end of the trial. And so began my journey into their absolute mind-fuck of a website. They have different pages for accounts etc. and no-where in my \"account\" information do they let you click cancel your account. \\n\\nThey also don\\'t let you remove your credit card or payment method. \\n\\nOnly when I go to their help section and find \"how to cancel the subscription\" do they inform you that the only way to cancel is to either email or call them - you can\\'t do it online. \\n\\nNot only that, they have 3 different bloody trials for their different sites that will charge you if you sign up for each, and each has to be cancelled separately. \\n\\nI emailed them 3 days ago requesting an immediate cancellation of all auto-renew. However, they ignored that mail and since I still haven\\'t heard back from them at all, tonight I had to call at bloody 11.30pm Australia time since their phone service is only for US hours. And it is not easy to call the damn 1800 number internationally, plus I got charged full international rates.\\n\\nThey also have a piss-poor automated voice command phone service that sent me down another damn rabbit hole before I could speak with anyone. The lady I spoke to was robotic and just asked for my details and then finally processed the cancellation, when I started (politely but directly) giving feedback on this poor experience, she hung up on me.\\n\\nSo anyway, I am just writing this post to vent and to make sure others are aware of how difficult and predatory they make it to cancel their trial. I am tech-savvy, but there would be thousands of older people who will have been sucked into paying for the auto-renewal without knowing how to get it cancelled easily. They let international people sign up, but they don\\'t offer an international number to call or international hours of telephone operation. \\n\\nI am absolutely disgusted that such a \"reputable\" business would run their site and trial this way. Really surprising because their content is generally pretty great, and with a things like their \"equipment reviews\" on YouTube and stuff they really market themselves as a business to be trusted.\\n\\nAnyway.... uh... thanks.', 'comments': ['California has a law that basically says if you signed up for it online you have to be able to cancel it online.
