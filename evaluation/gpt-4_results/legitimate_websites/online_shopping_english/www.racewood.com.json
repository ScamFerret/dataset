Since the Winter Sale is ongoing, is there a particular version where I could sit down and raise/breed/sell/etc animals as my main jig?

I didn\\'t pick the game up until 19, so I gotta ask: did 15 even have animal husbandry?', 'Basically every game you can do any of those, I’ve even made money off of only a chicken farm. Farming simulator 22 is undoubtedly the best, but if you want to be cheaper, then farming simulator 19 might be the way to go, it is very similar to farming simulator 22 with animals. I still would strongly recommend Farming Simulator 22 though, it is definitely worth the extra money.', 'Yes, you can do animals, I would suggest a good mod to start off with is [Enhanced Animal System](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=se&mod_id=259964) this is perfect for you cause you get more animals to play with, they have visual babies  and its for PC so perfect for you, I would do some research on this mod and see if this is the direction you want to go, there are also other mods that will make the process easier like u/Matrimcauthon7833 mentioned the [government subsidy](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=se&mod_id=223367&title=fs2022) sign that give you money, and production building to help with generating feed for the animals ([Farm Production](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=se&mod_id=261375&title=fs2022)). plus I think there is a [horse trainer](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=us&mod_id=230769&title=fs2022) mod that is PC only as well so you have plenty of option to choose from if that is the route you would like to go.', \"I have two maps that are egg production only.
