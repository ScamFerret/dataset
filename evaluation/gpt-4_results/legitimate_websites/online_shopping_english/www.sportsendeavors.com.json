As colleagues we always support each other no matter what and we have fun doing it, but beware: there are some prank wars that still haunt me to this day!!! :-D We did a team-building event at Camp Chestnut Lake and, boy, did we have a great time! The team bonding was so fun, and we discovered new ways to work and connect with our co-workers, which was the best part.
