The website content did not raise any immediate red flags, and the WHOIS record shows a long-standing domain registration. Despite the DNS SERVFAIL response, which could be a temporary issue, there is nothing conclusive to suggest that \"memorial-urns.com\" is a scam website. The lack of social media discussion could be due to the niche market of the business rather than an indication of a scam. Without concrete evidence of scam characteristics, I cannot classify \"memorial-urns.com\" as a scam website. I now know the final answer.
