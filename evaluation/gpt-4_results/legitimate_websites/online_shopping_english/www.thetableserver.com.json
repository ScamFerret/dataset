Since the website has been around for a long time, it is less likely to be a scam based on the domain age alone.

The certificate is also valid, with a recent start date and an expiration date that is a standard three months away.

Based on the information gathered from the WHOIS records, the certificate details, and the lack of any immediate red flags from the website content and external reviews, there is no strong evidence to suggest that \"The Table Server\" is a scam website.
