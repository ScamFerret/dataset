As people have said already you should be able to tell by the density. If it is concrete you could refinish it with a variable speed grinder and diamond polishing wheels. I\\'m guessing you probably don\\'t have these tools (you\\'re looking at a few hundred $ worth of tools) so you do have some other options. You can purchase diamond sanding sponges and use some elbow grease to get the stains out. Then you could seal it with a \"color enhancer sealer\" which could be purchased at a home center and is used on natural stone tile. Then you cold coat it with bees wax (one way to finish concrete tops). You can also purchase food safe wax at a stone tool supplier that is a little more industrial. If you went that route it would be more like $15 (sponge), $25 (color enhancer sealer), and $10 (wax). Here is a link to a company that carries lots of products and they have stores throughout the US. And if it doesn\\'t turn out the way you like you can always call a stone fabricating company and they can refinish it for you. https://www.granquartz.com/Pages/ItemProfile_Detail.aspx?ItemProfileId=1282&ItemClassNo=52', \"I'd say soapstone or dyed concrete. Try etching it from a cabinet interior - soapstone is relatively softer.  Regardless, it looks like it has a film finish on it (not so much a penetrating one - think polyurethane, etc).  IME, concrete is usually finished with a thicker epoxy film (but I haven't seen residential installations of it).  You will want to remove the rest of the failing finish (paint stripper, lacquer thinner) and install/maintain somethign with a better track record.
