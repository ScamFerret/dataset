[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenshi/comments/1ablecc/we_are_still_in_this_cesspool_they_call_a_city/) part is where you want to start!\\n\\n# From the Journal of White Mamba\\n\\n# DAY 133\\n\\nFinally! I got a new set of Masterwork limbs. It\\'s worlds away from the High and Specialist set I had previously.\\n\\nNoroo, Ignotus, Portius, Prudence, Praecan, Naru, Proceus and Nauk are now in my squad. They were either High Paladins, Noble Guards or even outright Inquisitors, in the case of Ignotus. They know how to fight...\\n\\nLastly, there\\'s Nguyen. He was also from the United Cities. He worked for us by hauling cactus to the storage. He is our strongest warrior even before taking the new limbs. Now he\\'s a monster.\\n\\nWe all have Roone\\'s personally designed Armor on top of that. Best armor ever created. Not joking.\\n\\nEach of us has a different random sidearm crafted by Samantha. Almost as good as Meitou from Cross. My weapon of choice is... my fists.\\n\\nWe have food, medical supplies and a Sleeping Bed. We\\'re almost ready to go.\\n\\nRoone is impatient. Whatever Luquin has told him the other day, it changed him. There\\'s a fire in his eyes were before there was... comfort, and a bit of complacency, I must admit. Now, he\\'s all about \\'moving to the next Phase, whatever the cost\\', and not \\'minimize risks\\' and \\'expected utility\\'. All big words, but I liked the Roone from a long time ago, when he first joined. The science books changed him somewhat, and not always for the better.\\n\\nFor two of us we went with a Naginata Katana and an Heavy Polearm, for lack of Crossbows.\\n\\n# DAY 134\\n\\nI went to take the supplies yesterday. I saw Roone. He\\'s still working at making food. He said he\\'ll keep doing what he did previously, to never forget what we are fighting for.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure what to make of that statement. We\\'re hardly fighting for food afterall.\\n\\nRoone said, we will eventually also need a squad of Toothpick wielders. I told him that Oldworld Crossbows of either sort are better... but Roone has called this new tecnique \\'stun locking\\'. Whatever that is.\\n\\nI look at the list Roone gave me before we depart.\\n\\n***To Kill.***\\n\\n~~Savant~~\\n\\nKing Gurgler\\n\\nCrab Queen\\n\\n~~Valamon~~\\n\\nQueen of South Hive (Name Unknown)\\n\\n~~Dust King~~\\n\\nBand of Bones Leader (Name Unknown)\\n\\nTower of Abuse\\n\\n*To Do:*\\n\\nResearch Swamp Factions&Bandits.\\n\\nResearch Shek Factions&Bandits.\\n\\nResearch about Noble Circle.\\n\\nResearch United Cities Bandit.\\n\\nRebirth Raid, free slaves.\\n\\nRaid on all Slave Camps of United Cities.\\n\\nCheck Cannibals up northwest.\\n\\nFind Anti Slavers, Outlaw Rebels, Flotsam Ninjas.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nRoone\\'s handwriting is clean and precise. He said that before taking down the nobles, we need to have an idea of what is going to happen to each of their cities. Luquin, Roone and myself were at the meeting, some of the previous noble guards, and Sadneil too, who said Skeletons shouldn\\'t ever meddle in human affairs *again*. That strikes me as... ominous. \\'Again\\', he said...\\n\\nRoone predicted that if we simply take down the nobles, cities will be either prey to bandits surrounding it, or be abandoned outright, destroyed. Who would pay the Samurais if we kill the ones with the money? And what would happen to the cities without that protection? After he pointed it out, even for me was all too obvious.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nWe decided to go west first. We reached the Swamps pretty fast... the day isn\\'t even over yet. And yet...\\n\\nWe took longer than we thought. ONE of us in particular is... slower.\\n\\nNguyen.\\n\\nWhich didn\\'t make sense. He\\'s one of the fastest warriors...\\n\\nAnd one of the first to get Skeleton Limbs, because he was the strongest and this would have had the greatest effect on our combat capabilities, according to Roone.\\n\\nAh.\\n\\nCrap.\\n\\nWe check his limbs. They\\'re all High quality instead of Masterwork. Because that\\'s what our first sets of limbs were...\\n\\nWe turn back. That was a quick and fruitless expedition, wasn\\'t it?\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nWe went back, changed his limbs and we\\'re back to the swamps. We\\'re faster now. And the day isn\\'t over yet.\\n\\nNext stop, Shark. There\\'s some research about the local factions that needs to be done.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nI walked into a bar, There was this Greenlander woman. Miu. She was an ex slave. So drunk that she couldn\\'t walk straight, really. Thankfully, it was only alcohol and not that shit they sell in here. I\\'ve sent one of the other guys to escort her back to base. She is happy to tend the farms!\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nBy the end of the day we have pieced the information together. There\\'s many factions, but it comes down to three of them. The Grayflayers, and the other two which we have just wiped out.\\n\\nOne would think that wiping out two factions, one of which was running the whole Swamp area, would have been more exciting.\\n\\nThe Hounds want us for our blood now. Big Grim is being hauled back to Fortress Freedom. We will let Roone decide what to do with her later. Meanwhile, two of our numbers, who were bringing Miu and another new recruit, Green, to our base, have come back. There are two bandit factions around here. We will search for their bases and wipe them out. Then we will move to the Shek Kingdom and see what kind of bandits are around there.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nWe are walking around. We found an old ruin with some documents about more ruins. And we find yet more ruins. Unsurprising. This world itself is a giant ruin. We don\\'t even sneak around. We walk. There\\'s nothing that can stop us here.\\n\\nAnd, apparently, the Hounds are sending a revenge party. Fodder for the turrets that Roone made us construct, in his words, \\'strategic positions\\'.\\n\\n# Day 135\\n\\nWe found an outpost, the Red Sabre Hideout. We wiped them out.\\n\\nWe went through them like a Jitte would go through a sheet of parchment, if the parchment was wet.\\n\\nOh, and the Red Sabre ringleader had an original Meitou. Samantha will be happy to have another one to study and compare to her own creations!\\n\\nWe found the Stone Rat Village. They\\'re inconsequential.\\n\\nWe found a new outpost. It\\'s the Swamp Ninjas.\\n\\nWe wipe them out.\\n\\nYay.\\n\\nI\\'m bored.\\n\\nWe found a bunch of giant moving things. They\\'re called Swamp Turtles, apparently. And they\\'re full of meat. We kill several.\\n\\nThe Swamp Ninja leader, Shade, is dead. The bandits he controlled in the swamp will be a lot less organized. We kinda cutted off one of its limbs and he bled out. I ponder if I should take the weapon...\\n\\nBut it\\'s only an Edgewalker. Junk, for our people.\\n\\nWe take the body, not really because of the bounty, but because we want to let Sheks know. We defeated those enemies.\\n\\nGiving in some bounties might give us some reputation.\\n\\nAll in a day\\'s work.\\n\\n# DAY 136\\n\\nWe are now on our way to the Shek Kingdom. It would be more appropriate to call it Queendom, really. Esata is a woman after all.\\n\\nWe find, by pure chance, the Band of Bones hideout. If you could call it that. They lived like... desperate people. They attacked us. And they all died. Even the leader. We took her body. One survived. We gave them medical attentions. Actually, it might have been better if we didn\\'t. They\\'re missing a leg now.\\n\\nWe find some of Kral\\'s Chosen, who attack us. Dear Journal... you know how it went.\\n\\nThese couple of days have been the most eventful I have ever lived, and yet they\\'re also the most unexciting.\\n\\nRoone, for all of Luquin\\'s complaining, didn\\'t waste all of that time. It was all preparations. I see the fruits now. Of the *uncomplete* preparations, I might add! We\\'re only ten. We only have six Oldworld bows and one Ranger, of which only one is of Masterwork Quality. No Masterwork Armor either.\\n\\nAnd we\\'re still... so unstoppable.\\n\\nI\\'ll have to speak to Luquin about it. I feel he has been unfair.\\n\\nWe reached Admag. An unexpected surprise for me waited there. A Thieves Tower. With whom, we are allies. And they had a Plastic Surgeon. I wanted to change my name ever since getting my new limbs. I struggled to decide, between Cyber Mamba, and Metal Mamba...\\n\\nI am, henceforth, to be called by my new name. Cyber Metal Mamba!\\n\\n# From the Journal of Cyber Metal Mamba\\n\\n# DAY 136\\n\\nAnyways. We collected a bunch of bounties, and we\\'re halfway to allying the Sheks. As Roone wanted us to. According to the Great Plan, they won\\'t be wiped off the world and we want them to like us.\\n\\n# DAY 139\\n\\nWe\\'re back. The last three days we\\'ve captured a couple Dust Bandits, released them near the capital of Shek Kingdom, let them do some harm, get a bounty, capture them after they get their asses handled to them, healed them, and put them in prison. Almost all the work was done by me. As in, me, personally. That was a fresh breather from the mindless slaughter, I was in my element again. Anyways, after we just got enough reputation from that, we went on our way. Shek Kingdom is our ally now. Roone will be happy!\\n\\nI met Samantha while checking her progress on those \\'fake Meitou\\', as she called them.\\n\\nShe can eventually make better weapons than the Meitous, she says, but they won\\'t be lasting forever as the actual masterpieces of Cross. They will last our lifetime, and probably even longer, but that\\'s it.\\n\\nGood enough.\\n\\nAlso, she asks if we can find the Blueprint of Paladin\\'s Cross, which she misses and is probably in Holy Nation. And of Iron Stick, which we saw bandits using.\\n\\nIron Sticks aren\\'t all that good, but Paladin\\'s Cross are. We will make those a priority.\\n\\nI gave Roone all the intel we had about Shek Factions and Bandits. He says we shouldn\\'t let Esata be overthrown, ever. He then updated my list, giving me new objectives and removing those we achieved.\\n\\n# DAY 140\\n\\nThe plan was to move out today. It was just as the day begun, that we heard a horde of Hounds and Black Dragon Ninjas coming. At the same time.\\n\\nWe had to stay. The camp would have been able to protect itself anyways, seriously, but we were there, why risk it?\\n\\nThey came, and we hoped they would eliminate each others. Dragon Ninjas were here because they\\'re a bunch of fuckers. The Hounds wanted to punish us for taking Big Grim. She was still in our camp. Without weapons, armour and limbs.\\n\\nLuquin argued that killing her in cold blood only because she was \\'an inconvenient leader for the neighboring towns\\' was befitting of a Noble.\\n\\nRoone agreed, but also remarked that Big Grim wasn\\'t some innocent bystander. He also said there was a bonus to keeping her alive, if he was right about something. He didn\\'t say what.\\n\\nI find they\\'re both right, but we were delayed.\\n\\n...\\n\\nDelayed... for three hours, tops.\\n\\nThe plan was to move out today. And we are moving out today.\\n\\nThey came as a horde, like a wave of water against our gates. The Harpoon halved their numbers. As the gates broke under their hits, they found me and my team behind it. It went as one would expect. They died in short order. We finished repairing the gates and went for the Holy Nation.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t even bother looting the corpses. A couple Cats are nothing. We saw that Roone has also starting producing Hashish to sell. Flat Lagoon isn\\'t far, and they pay good money for it.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nWe visit a Waystation, on the way, as the name implies. Border Zone apparently is where one of our targets is. A tower. The Shinobis that just attacked us live there. We don\\'t know exactly where. Nobody in the Waystation does. We don\\'t buy or sell anything. We already have what we need after all.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nOn the way there, we get to the Dust King tower. We visit, to see why the hell they\\'re still around. We walk in brazenly, we see a bunch of Dust Bandits licking their wounds... from last time they met us.\\n\\nAnd also...\\n\\n\"Remember me, bloodsack?\"\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\n\"Or maybe you\\'d recognize me without the BROKEN NOSE!?\"\\n\\nDust King himself.\\n\\nHe\\'s still here. I thought I had brought him to the Holy Nation. I put him in a cage there. Well...\\n\\nHe\\'s dead now.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s... not tell Roone about this, please guys?\" I don\\'t want he to know I fucked up a job. However that happened.\\n\\nOnward we go. The search for the Black Dragon Ninjas continue.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nWe spread out in every direction. The first to find the Tower will go back to Waystation. After a day, we all go back. If this doesn\\'t work, we repeat. We don\\'t wander aimlessly, we do what Roone called a spiderweb pattern. Eventually, Nauk found it. It\\'s still early evening. We travel there and... I ask everyone to let me do this alone.\\n\\nNinjas vs Ninja.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nI approach the tower. Unseen by the enemy.\\n\\nThere is one of our first targets outside. I go behind them. I knock them out.\\n\\nIt\\'s Dimak. I search for their inventory. It\\'s a Meitou Ninja Blade! Samantha will be happy to add it to her collection. Also. some Grog and Sake. I rob her blind, then go back to my companions. I drop her to the ground. Someone will pick her up. I have another target.\\n\\nI go back in. There\\'s my other target and... another five Black Dragon Ninjas. I have time to knock one of them out, and then...\\n\\nThey see me and attack. I hold my own, they\\'re not dangerous to me. I dodge and dodge and get hit at times... My companions join in. I failed my mission...\\n\\nBuzan and a bunch of others are dead.\\n\\nI should have gone at night...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nWe reach Squin as night comes to hand over the bounties. The Black Dragon Ninjas are going to disappear soon. I am not happy though. I\\'m not as good as I thought.\\n\\nWe go into Squin and drop all of the Dragon Ninjas on the ground near the station. We don\\'t even bother talking to the guards. They can simply go and take the bandits themselves.\\n\\nWe sit at the bar. Well, the whole squad does. I go around, searching for recruits. We need more people hauling stuff around at base, and some more Robotic crafters too, according to Roone.\\n\\nAlso...\\n\\nThe Dragon Ninjas didn\\'t attack the Sheks, nor did the Sheks attack the Ninjas.\\n\\nCrap. Didn\\'t they have a bounty? Ah... I\\'ll clear this mess on my own, I guess. I\\'ll follow them and knock the remaining leader out. The other isn\\'t a good runner, being dead and all.\\n\\n# DAY 141\\n\\nI left everybody behind. I\\'ll do this alone. I ran straight to the Tower again. It\\'s on the other side of the Border Zone. I always wondered why\\'s called that. Maybe it\\'s because it\\'s a border between Holy Nation and Shek Kingdom. But why aren\\'t other zones called that too?\\n\\nLong story short, I knock out fifteen of them plus Dimak. This time is a bit darker, being early morning.\\n\\nDimak... She has another Meitou with her now. Cross made two of them and she found both? Eh...\\n\\nNow all the squad will catch up to me, and I\\'ll go to... Stack. I guess.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nIt\\'s afternoon. I want to wait night to get inside a Weapon Shop, or some Barracks.\\n\\nThey\\'re the most likely places where to find the Blueprint\\n\\nBut I don\\'t wait. I go inside the police station, a big Stationhouse. All the cages are full of almost dying hungry bandits. I heal all of them, free the Leader and put my quarry inside the cage. Then... I think I\\'ll have some fun!\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nI freed them. Most of them are following me. I saw how this goes a couple of times already. They follow you, ask to join sometimes. I have other things to do right now though. I go to the nearby Armory. I knock three of the Holy Sentinels unconscious before they discover me. The whole city goes after me. I\\'m *quite* good at martial arts by this point! I am also faster, so I can position myself better. Most of them lose consciousness, some lose a limb. An High Paladin is now on my back. We might need to use a new training dummy, the Dust Boss we kept is now dead...\\n\\nI also found the Paladin\\'s Cross schematics. I can\\'t understand them, but back home Samantha or Luquin, or Roone, will know what to do.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I kidnap most High Paladins and Paladins who survived my presence. I bring them outside the wall, where the rest of my comrades is waiting. We will get the full squad bringing someone back, if I can help it!\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nI go to the Stationhouse serving as Police Barracks again. I assist to something that makes my blood boil. Slavemongers. They\\'re taking the Hungry Bandits as slaves. Probably to Rebirth. I know what both Luquin and Roone would want me to do.\\n\\nLuquin would want me to save them.\\n\\nRoone would want me to stay safe and stick to the plan of getting more \\'volunteers\\'.\\n\\nI do both.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nThe slavemongers are all knocked down and in Holy Nation cages before the day ended.\\n\\nAlso, our squad has a couple of Inquisitors and a lot of Paladins. More Paladins, Holy Servants and Holy Chosen are at our feet in multiple pools of their own blood, dead.\\n\\nThe High Inquisitor in this city... I can\\'t find him. Maybe he\\'s somewhere, unconscious. Well... it wasn\\'t part of the plan to take him anyways. Time to head back.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nWe are home.\\n\\nWhile we were away the Dust Bandits attacked us again.\\n\\nThe Gate was broken.\\n\\nThere was blood everywhere, as well as corpses... We didn\\'t come back in time...\\n\\n... to have lunch with our comrades.\\n\\nWe clean he Dust Bandit\\'s corpses, smelt the whole armor sets and their weapons.\\n\\nWe repaired the gate, and started unloading the stuff we looted this time. A bunch of meat, some skin, the two meitou Ninja Blades, the Blueprint. Samantha will be crafting the Paladin\\'s Cross soon.\\n\\nThere\\'s enough Robotic Limbs for another three people. Only one Leg is missing for a fourth. A new round of recruitment will be going now, and we\\'ll give them some improved weapons and armor. And limbs, too. That\\'s important.\\n\\n# DAY 144\\n\\nGood news. Holy Nation is sending new recruits or dead bodies our way. Depends how stubborn they are.\\n\\nSheks are also sending reinforcements.\\n\\nThey come at the end of the day, as night approaches. So much for a cult based on light!\\n\\nWe sent Nguyen, our strongest warrior, armed with a jitte. With some luck, some of them will live. Also there\\'s Harpoons. We shouldn\\'t forget about that. And a small lake to slow them down.\\n\\nI can\\'t see the future and I\\'m not as smart as Roone, but I\\'m betting it will be a massacre.\\n\\n# DAY 145\\n\\nNah. They\\'re all dead. Also, the Sheks just arrived.\\n\\n\"Today is a good day for battle\" and so on...\\n\\nNguyen simply shrugs, the Okran\\'s idiots have already been dealt with. Thanks a lot.\\n\\nBut the Hounds are at it again, just as the Sheks want to go... the irony.\\n\\nRoone sends our army. Me included. The Sheks don\\'t even drop one swing. It\\'s all over in less time than it takes to repair the Gate.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nMeanwhile we finished the recruiting process of the Paladins we kidnapped. Someone else did. I\\'m a woman, they don\\'t even talk to me.\\n\\nThree of them wouldn\\'t join, no matter what. They died starving. Some of us said the Peeler might have been a more fitting end.\\n\\nOur leaders decided to start that phase of the plan. Oldbows MK.II for everyone are coming!\\n\\nPart of the Army, me included, will now cook. I already have experience with it, and now three ex Paladins will also get to learn. Five cooking stoves active, and we probably won\\'t be able to consume the products of the farms as fast as they get cultivated...\\n\\nOr, actually, only four. One of the stoves was supposed to be for Gohan, but we aren\\'t producing any rice, currently. We have the whole second floor of the stationhouse which could be used... Luquin and Roone should decide what to do, not my problem. I either cook or kill enemies. Or steal.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nAfter telling them about it, they decided to actually build six Hydrosomething farms for Riceweed. Given our mission, Luquin and Roone decided it would be better to include more stealthy companions. Zaro, Espher and Saint had already trained to that role, and will get the appropriate... modifications.\\n\\nAlso... We\\'re running out of Steel, with all the Crossbow crafting, Weapon Crafting and even Robotic Limb Crafting...\\n\\nStrangely enough... I\\'ve noticed that Roone is the one pushing us to rescue Slaves the most. Luquin, instead, seems to slow us down, and reduce risks. I once overheard them talking, and Luquin said to Roone that rushing things wasn\\'t what the lesson was about. What lesson? Roone\\'s the smart one teaching stuff...\\n\\nAnyways. We are producing vast amounts of food. There\\'s eight of us cooking and brewing... and one of us... \\'cooking\\'... for Flats Lagoon mainly.\\n\\n# DAY 161\\n\\nMe and Zaro traveled alone to Flats Lagoon. We sold a big part of the carefully handcrafted Armor that Luquin made way back in Sho Battai. Some of it was Masterwork. But we\\'re crafting Alloy Armor pieces now. This is junk by comparison. It still hurts... this was an uniform of sorts... sentimental value...\\n\\nAlso, we\\'ve sold most of the Edge Type and lower quality weapons that Samantha crafted, and even some of the fake Meitous, which are still by far better than anything people these days are able to make. That was good money, sure, but mostly, we wanted to make space in our base for new weapons and armor...\\n\\nAnd now we\\'re going to sell our over two hundred Hashish. And a bunch of other stuff which is useless to us, really. Stone, Bloodrum, several alcoholics, some Cotton I\\'ve stolen myself way back when we didn\\'t think we\\'d ever go full Hemp...\\n\\nAs we come back to base, Roone puts it elegantly. \\'We freed some inventory space. In the process, we gained some more useless Cats.\\' Luquin seems to approve Roone\\'s disinterest in money. We have another four sets of Light Alloy Armor for Crossbow Stealthy Ninja Assassins, but we need to train more people in those arts. This... is better done in enemy territory, I guess. Or we could use some of the captured Paladins which didn\\'t join our ranks, that\\'d work too, somewhat.\\n\\n# FROM THE JOURNAL OF ROONE\\n\\n# DAY 161\\n\\nWe give up on recruiting Paladins. We found a better target. Hounds.\\n\\nWith Big Grim in our grasp and being near the Swamp, they come at us often. Especially when she gets her daily dose of Peeler, her screams attract a bunch of them. Those who survive the Harpoon barrage get into a cell after having a tour on the shoulder of one of our guys. They see how life is here, they see that their boss is as good as done for.\\n\\nEventually, they join us. Barely less skilled than a Paladin, with half the hassle.\\n\\nJust as planned.\\n\\nWe are growing fast. Food\\'s not a problem, I would know, being the cook.\\n\\nThe problem is...\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t craft a single piece of armor today.\" Luquin says. \"You know why I couldn\\'t?\"\\n\\n\"No, but I\\'m sure I\\'ll know soon, right?\" I answer. Actually, I\\'m fairly sure.. It\\'s probably because...\\n\\n\"I\\'m lacking Chainmail Sheets and Armor Platings.\"\\n\\nYeah. That.\\n\\n\"And I\\'m lacking them because my two assistants don\\'t have enough Steel and Raw Iron. What\\'s up with that?!?\"\\n\\n\"Eh... I\\'ve decided to... expand our Robotics department. Just a bit.\"\\n\\nLuquin smiles at that \"Was \\'bout time.\" He frowns when I don\\'t smile back. \"That\\'s good. Right?\"\\n\\nWell. He\\'s going to find out all of that in due time, so it\\'s better to take care of it right away. \"I\\'ve quintupled our Press, Motor, Skeleton Muscle and Robotics production, and that should be enough for two Robotic Limb Benches operating almost the whole time.\" I place the last Foodcube I was cooking into the Storage.\\n\\n\"Of course, that\\'s only true if those Robotic Benches were able to operate at full capacity. Which isn\\'t the case. Because they\\'re lacking the raw materials just like you.\"\\n\\n\"But then we just need more Iron Ore Drills and expand the whole production chain! Right?\" He seems to be able to read my mood, because he adds, in an unsure tone \"...right?\"\\n\\nI sigh, while cooking some more Meat for the next Foodcube.\\n\\n\"We could. The iron node we\\'re currently using is not easy to expand upon. There\\'s the Inner Circle on one side, your and Samantha\\'s Workplace on the other, a lake to the right and all the Iron Refineries on the left. So, that\\'s not good. Using the other Iron Node would probably mess up the Haulers\\' schedules and jobs... expanding to include another Iron Node nearby would come with many problems as well. There\\'s a bunch of drawbacks to all possible solutions... \"\\n\\nHe looks unhappy \"then take care of those drawbacks too!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m... not able to. I have to think about the flowchart from raw metals to...\"\\n\\n\"You know I don\\'t know that stuff. You\\'re the sciency guy, I\\'m the Armorsmith. Stop cooking and go do your job. Think. Someone else can make those!\" He picks a Foodcube to show it at me.\\n\\nA bigh sigh escapes my mouth... \"I will take some days to think about it. For now... enjoy the free time?\"\\n\\n# DAY 170\\n\\nThere is an iron resource between the Cactus Farms and the Robotic Benches. The place isn\\'t exactly enough for everything, but it\\'s better than behind the Inner Circle, or even outside the base...\\n\\nI\\'ve sent Cyber Metal Mamba on a new mission. Sell all our newly produced stuff to Black Lagoon, then continue in that general direction, working through whatever\\'s on the list I gave her and in the area she will be going It\\'s a bigger mission.\\n\\n# FROM THE JOURNAL OF CYBER METAL MAMBA\\n\\n# DAY 171\\n\\nWe reached Flats Lagoon in two hours top. Sold all the booze and drugs we had. We could have brougth more to sell, but as Roone and Luquin always say, money is really not a concern for us anymore.\\n\\nYesterday we traveled towards Stobe\\'s Gamble, and went to the Anti-Slavers. After a small amount of sorting out what they stand for, we allied them. Tensions between us and United Cities are high now, any wrong twitch and they\\'ll declare us enemies. Unlike the Traders Guilds, which now hate us. Going towards The Crags, we found a place called Iron HQ.\\n\\nTotal nutcases lived there. They\\'re clearly humans, but believe to be skeletons. We are more Skeleton than them, with our robotic limbs. Their boss is now dead, I obtained a new AI core for Roone to study, if he ever does. Oh well... We have another Meitou for Samantha, so it\\'s a plus!\\n\\nWe went down toward the Pits, and found a couple of outposts. We opened one, full of crazy robots that screamed \\'Police!\\' and attacked. We searched the place. There was nothing in any of the containers! A waste of time.\\n\\nWe decided it was a good time to pick up on Roone\\'s habit of Prospecting any new land. The Pits are surprisingly great. Insane stone, iron and copper mining output, plenty of water, good wind. Land\\'s as dead as farmer into Beak Thing\\'s territory. It might be possible to make a full base here, if we needed.\\n\\nWe travel north. Apparently rebel farmers come from north-west of Sho-Battai. We need to search there.\\n\\nI ask we stop on Black Scratch. The Great Library might have books we didn\\'t find last time. Roone loves books.\\n\\n# FROM THE JOURNAL OF ROONE\\n\\n# DAY 172\\n\\nSigh... I should have sent Mamba to collect Iron Plates first, give them to us and THEN on the current mission. Things are proceeding slowly. To craft more Iron Plates... we need more plates. Ironic.\\n\\nWe\\'ve finished recruiting most of the Hounds from the last attack. I COULD send them to take more Iron Plates... none of them is a thievery expert... but...\\n\\nBut we have money. And we\\'re producing a lot of stuff to sell too. We could send someone to... who\\'s producing the most iron plates? And buy their whole stacks of plates over and over. We\\'ll deck someone in our spare sets of armor lying around, and send a squad of five.\\n\\n# DAY 174\\n\\nNever mind that. Plan B was scratched as Cyber Metal Mamba came back with the whole squad. I didn\\'t expect her to be back so soon.\\n\\nHer report was short, for all the things they\\'ve done... They sold stuff at Flats Lagoon, They said they could bring more to sell next time. We reached the two million cats mark.\\n\\nThey reached Stobe\\'s Gamble, allied the Anti-Slavers, went to The Craigs to destroy the Skeleton Bandits, proceeded south to the Pits, which would be a good outpost place given we have Hydroponic technology.\\n\\nThey went north toward Black Scratch, stole two now useless Blueprints for Armor, stole a bunch of books for me (sweet of her to think about me mid mission!) and finally went north through the Gut. And that\\'s what stopped the mission. Beak Things. They were everywhere.\\n\\n....we needed more meat. So they took down all they could, took some Beak Thing Eggs for good measure.\\n\\nWith filled backpacks, they went through Eyesocket, almost killing everyone. Freed a bunch of slaves, of which two joined us. They\\'ll haul stuff around for us.\\n\\nAfter that they went to Heng to try to buy or steal some Trader\\'s Backpacks, because they wanted to continue the mission... but they found none and had to come back. And now they\\'re here. They also took some Iron Plates here and there. But not enough. We\\'ll be able to build one more Refineriy. Now they\\'ll rest until we sort through their inventory.\\n\\n# DAY 181\\n\\nWe were moving toward the last phase. We have more than enough high combat personnel, and we have the materials.\\n\\nAfter talking about it with Luquin, Samantha, Mamba and Sadneil, we reached the conclusion that having more outposts in key locations will facilitate our plans. One at the edge in each cardinal direction, maybe more. Freedom Fortress, here in Shem, will serve for all of our crafting purposes.\\n\\nI\\'ve talked about the deciding factors for the new bases\\' locations. The outposts will have a highly defensible position, if possible either near natural walls or a body of water. The only resources truly needed are a windy area and water. For this task, I will need to go along, I think. I don\\'t delegate such matters lightly.\\n\\nMultiple things need to be done to make the next steps work properly.\\n\\nTransporting food every now and then might become a problem down the line, as we expand. If each base produces enough for themselves, that\\'s one thing taken care of.\\n\\nRobotics, Armour and Weapons proceed too slowly, I fear.\\n\\nThere is a clear path to follow. Luquin is fully behind me, restraining me when I get too... enthusiastic. Reminding me that the lesson I learned wasn\\'t to rush into things, it was to get things moving, when they needed to be moved.\\n\\nCyber Metal Mamba is my eyes, my ears and my arms wherever she goes. She\\'s a loyal friend.\\n\\nSadneil is providing me with more and more information about the way things work. Not only robotics. He\\'s old. Older than any of us can fathom.\\n\\nThe things he\\'s said to me, they\\'re part of the reason I decided to make multiple bases.\\n\\nThe Plan goes on.\\n\\n# NOTES\\n\\nIn the comments', 'comments': ['Fun read. Keep it coming!', \"NOTES:\\n\\nI reached the character limit of 40000. Not easy to believe, right? I mean... this thing's so short...

While it seemed at first like a routine stop — the light above its license plate was out — the troopers made a curious find.\\n\\nWhen they searched the van, they found nearly 2,000 bottles of top-shelf cognac and a pack of razor blades, which they surmised had been used to remove the bottles’ tax stamps. The driver claimed ignorance. He said that a friend from New York, a man named Hamlet Peralta, had asked him as a favor to drive the brandy from New Hampshire to a church party an hour south of Lowell. But the law was the law, and the driver was arrested for transporting untaxed liquor. His case was soon disposed of with six months of probation and a $1,000 fine.\\n\\nWhat no one knew at the time was that this two-bit bootlegging run was the tip of a criminal scheme that within three years would be used as evidence in an unimaginably larger case, a federal corruption investigation that would ultimately reach deep into New York City’s highest offices of power. While the inquiry began with Mr. Peralta, it eventually engulfed a Dickensian cast of characters: two Orthodox Jewish businessmen, an influential union leader, a hedge fund mogul, a coterie of top police officials — even the city’s mayor.\\n\\nBecause the case has involved so many people and has moved through the courts in separate pieces, its story, at least so far, has been told in serial increments. Some of the nearly 20 figures it has touched have pleaded guilty. Some have gone to trial. Others have escaped public censure — except, perhaps, in the headlines. But the sprawling paper trail the case has left behind — legal filings, trial transcripts and wiretap records — reveals a larger saga of favor-trading and back-room deals that connects its various players in an intersecting web of venality and vice.\\n\\nIn May, the last two targets of the probe — Jeremy Reichberg, an Orthodox Jewish community leader from Brooklyn, and James Grant, a former Police Department deputy inspector — will appear in Federal District Court in Manhattan at a bribery trial that will also feature a dozen other uncharged co-conspirators. As it nudges the case toward its conclusion, the trial will reprise the investigation’s central theme: that a culture of graft — sometimes petty, sometimes serious — has existed in New York since the days of Tammany Hall.\\n\\nThe authorities have never said what tipped them off to Mr. Peralta, but in an affidavit that the Federal Bureau of Investigation used to tap his cellphone, investigators said that in February 2013 an anonymous letter was sent to the Police Department’s anti-corruption nerve center, the Internal Affairs Bureau. The letter, which appears to be the first public mention of the inquiry, contained an explosive allegation: The man in charge of Harlem’s 30th Precinct, Deputy Inspector Ruel Stephenson, was crooked. Specifically, it claimed that the deputy inspector was close with someone named Hamlet and often warned him when the police were planning to inspect his businesses.\\n\\nAt that point, Hamlet Peralta owned two businesses in Harlem, a liquor store on West 125th Street and the Hudson River Cafe, a restaurant several blocks to the north. Perched near the water, Hudson River Cafe was known both for its views and its lively “club nights” that featured bands and D.J.’s. It was also known as a police hangout.\\n\\nA gregarious man born in the Dominican Republic, Mr. Peralta, 39, was friends with several officers from nearby precincts, men who called him “bro” and regularly texted him with gossip. In April 2013, two months after getting the tipster’s letter, Internal Affairs sent undercover detectives to speak with him at his restaurant. According to court papers, the detectives pretended that they wanted Mr. Peralta’s help with “an outstanding ticket.” Mr. Peralta told them that he had “a very good relationship with Inspector Stephenson” and trying to be helpful, passed along his number.\\n\\nWithin a matter of months, investigators were digging deeper into Mr. Peralta’s business deals. They found two confidential sources who told them that for years Mr. Peralta had purchased spirits out of state — or sometimes stolen off trucks — and sold them wholesale to restaurants and nightclubs in violation of his liquor license. They also learned about the role he played in the brandy shipment discovered in the traffic stop in Massachusetts. EDITORS’ PICKS How One Interview Question Fuels the Gender Pay Gap They Survived a Massacre. Then the Lawyers Started Calling. A Very German Love Story: When Old Left and Far Right Share a Bedroom\\n\\nMr. Peralta’s bank accounts were particularly suspect. Court filings say that money flowed into them from one person and then out to another in a manner suggesting a Ponzi scheme. The filings also said that hundreds of thousands of dollars had been transferred in recent years to two convicted drug dealers. The records further indicated that Mr. Peralta owed large sums to the state tax authority and was substantially in debt to a capo in the Genovese crime family.\\n\\nBut what pushed the case forward — and finally undid Mr. Peralta — was a series of seemingly innocuous transactions. In his accounts, court papers said, the authorities found numerous deposits from a company called JSR Capital — among them, a $250,000 check with “liquor loan” written on its memo line.\\n\\nFollowing the money, investigators learned that JSR was a real-estate firm with offices on Fifth Avenue, a few blocks south of St. Patrick’s Cathedral. It took its name from the initials of its owner: Jona S. Rechnitz.\\n\\n“It Made Him Look Good, Made Me Look Good”\\n\\nMr. Rechnitz was an up-and-comer from California. He had arrived in New York in his late teens from Los Angeles, where he grew up as the scion of a wealthy family that was staunchly pro-Israel and active in Republican Party politics. His father, Robert Rechnitz, a successful real-estate developer, had served as a finance chairman on Senator Lindsey Graham’s 2016 presidential campaign and was a prominent donor to Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel. But the family’s real money belonged to Mr. Rechnitz’s cousin who owned a chain of California nursing homes that ultimately fell afoul of state and federal regulators.\\n\\nAfter attending Yeshiva University in Upper Manhattan, Mr. Rechnitz followed in his father’s footsteps and tried to make a go of it in New York City real estate. For his first few years, those who knew him said, he worked in minor jobs at middling firms like Marcus & Millichap. But in 2007, he edged closer to success, taking a post at Africa Israel USA, the American subsidiary of the international development firm Africa Israel, which was owned by the billionaire diamond dealer Lev Leviev.\\n\\nBy his own account, Mr. Rechnitz started slowly at Africa Israel, fetching coffee and picking up dry cleaning for its New York chief executive. But as he later testified, he enjoyed the company’s ambience of “trophy properties” and “luxury developers.” Within a few years, as he progressed at the firm and eventually became its director of acquisitions, Mr. Rechnitz began to make connections to the machers and scoundrels who populated the world of New York real estate — something else he seemed to enjoy.\\n\\n“I have never seen a young man so schooled in networking,” said someone who had dealings with him at the time and requested anonymity to avoid the investigation. “He made his life all about connective tissues. He doesn’t know how to do financial analysis. He doesn’t know how to put together a proposal. He doesn’t have normal business skills. But he knew everyone.” Comments\\n\\nThe Times needs your voice. We welcome your on-topic commentary, criticism and expertise.\\n\\nForever on the hunt for people who could help him advance his prestige or career, Mr. Rechnitz noticed one day that one of his Africa Israel clients had custom license plates marked “Sheriff” that gave him special parking privileges. “When he came to meet me, he would park wherever he wanted,” Mr. Rechnitz later said in court, “and that is something I thought was pretty cool.”\\n\\nMr. Rechnitz wanted his own set of the plates, and the client offered to introduce him to the man who had provided them. His name was Jeremy Reichberg, and he would soon be hosting a charity dinner for the N.Y.P.D.’s football team, the client said. When Mr. Rechnitz learned that “a lot of the higher-ups in the Police Department” would be at the event, he was even more convinced he had to go.\\n\\nSo, hustling as always, he bought a $5,000 ticket. Mr. Reichberg, he recalled, was “very happy with the donation” and arranged for the football team to give him a memorial plaque. “It made him look good, made me look good,” Mr. Rechnitz said, “and we started to become friends.”\\n\\nAside from dabbling in real estate and diamonds, Mr. Reichberg, now 44, also worked as an official liaison between the Police Department and Borough Park’s Orthodox Jewish community. The department uses liaisons throughout the city to keep abreast of the concerns of local residents, but prosecutors say that Mr. Reichberg considered the post as both a public-service job and a personal profit center. In their early meetings, Mr. Rechnitz said, Mr. Reichberg described himself as “a fix-it guy” who used his police connections to help his friends in Borough Park take care of things like parking tickets and moving violations. For rendering these courtesies, he charged a small fee.\\n\\nAs the men grew closer, Mr. Reichberg supposedly acknowledged performing other favors. Once, Mr. Rechnitz said, he confessed that he had sent the police to a colleague’s diamond business to chase away a rival who was handing out fliers in front of his store. The police were later “rewarded with jewelry,” Mr. Rechnitz said.\\n\\nTo fulfill these requests, the government says, Mr. Reichberg relied on a stable of pliant police officials. Among them, prosecutors claim, was Mr. Grant, who at that point ran the 72nd Precinct nearby in Sunset Park, and Michael Harrington, an inspector assigned to a larger unit, Patrol Borough Brooklyn South. Mr. Reichberg also had connections, the government says, to a former commander of Borough Park’s 66th Precinct who had left the department to become the police commissioner in Floral Park, N.Y. Court papers say that he had similar relationships in the Westchester County Police Department and the New York courts.\\n\\n“He had all these connections to police,” Mr. Rechnitz testified. “I didn’t know many people that had connections with police, growing up in Los Angeles, and I thought this would be an awesome tool for me personally and for my business.”\\n\\nNot long after the football dinner, Lev Leviev, the head of Africa Israel, came to New York on a business trip. Wanting to impress him, Mr. Rechnitz called Mr. Reichberg, who, he said, offered to have the police escort Mr. Leviev from his private plane at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel into the city. Prosecutors say that at Mr. Reichberg’s behest, the police shut down one of the tunnel’s lanes so that Mr. Leviev could sail through on his own. “This is good,” Mr. Rechnitz remembered thinking at the time. “This will earn me a lot of points.”\\n\\nIn the months that followed, Mr. Rechnitz said, he started joining Mr. Reichberg for expensive dinners at which they entertained police officials and were rewarded with little perks like getting invited behind security lines at the New York City Marathon and the New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square. The two men developed a dynamic based on their money and connections. “Jeremy would deal with more of the details, if something needed to be done,” Mr. Rechnitz later said, “and I would be the guy to basically pay for it.”\\n\\nIn 2011, at age 29, Mr. Rechnitz left Africa Israel and opened JSR Capital. In his later testimony, he claimed to have owned as much as $100 million in holdings at one point. He bought the old Mount Hope Medical Center in the Bronx and, not long after, a building at 238 Madison Avenue in Manhattan. He also owned two townhouses in the East Village and a sprawling complex called Solomon’s Plaza in Borough Park, Brooklyn.\\n\\nBut even if his properties were something less than glamorous, JSR gave Mr. Rechnitz a pool of capital to spend on his new friends, and his expenditures were eventually legion. On the witness stand, he testified that during this period he regularly racked up credit card bills of $1 million a year. As one lawyer involved in the case later claimed in court, Mr. Rechnitz often spent more on New York Knicks tickets — one of his favorite gifts — than he did on his taxes.\\n\\nBy early 2013, the government says, the two men’s ties to the police had widened. They struck up friendships with four deputy chiefs in top commands across the city, including David Colon, who ran the department’s Housing Bureau. In a bit of coincidence, Deputy Chief Colon was friends with Mr. Peralta and an occassional patron of the Hudson River Cafe. (Though none of these officials were ultimately charged, most of them either retired or were transferred from their posts.)\\n\\nAs they expanded their network, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg also became more brazen. In February 2013, the government said, they chartered a private jet — for nearly $60,000 — and flew Mr. Grant and David Milici, a detective from the 72nd Precinct, to Las Vegas for an all-expense-paid weekend at the Super Bowl. There were tickets to the game, prosecutors said, and luxury suites at the MGM Grand.\\n\\nThere was something else, too: a high-priced escort — “a professional in her industry,” as Mr. Grant’s lawyer later called her — joined the men on the flight in a special costume that Mr. Reichberg bought: a sexy stewardess’s outfit.\\n\\nMoving Up in the Ranks\\n\\nPhilip Banks III was a legend in the Police Department. Capping a career of nearly 30 years, he was promoted in March 2013 to chief of the department, the highest uniformed position on the force. Rumor had it that there was even more was in store for Chief Banks, the top black official in the N.Y.P.D. As prosecutors noted in a legal filing, he was on a shortlist for deputy commissioner.\\n\\nIn one of his early moves, Chief Banks plucked his protégé, Michael Harrington, from Brooklyn South to work as his executive officer. While this was a coup for Mr. Harrington, it was also one for Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg. After moving into 1 Police Plaza, Mr. Harrington introduced the men to Chief Banks. As Mr. Rechnitz later claimed in court, the fortuitous staffing change gave him “access to the highest levels at the N.Y.P.D.” — or what he called a “one-stop shop for assistance.”\\n\\nWithin weeks of Mr. Harrington taking his new job, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg lavished him with gifts, the government said. Mr. Rechnitz sent him Knicks and New York Rangers tickets, court papers say, while Mr. Reichberg helped arrange a contract for a security company his brother owned.\\n\\nMr. Grant was also still receiving the men’s largess. When he and his family went to Rome in August 2013, Mr. Rechnitz paid a portion of their hotel bill, prosecutors say. A few months later, according to court papers, they bought Mr. Grant a $3,000 watch and spent another $6,000 to install new railings on his house in Staten Island.\\n\\nThen on Christmas Day, prosecutors say, the two religious Jews, who typically wore sober black and white, showed up at the Grant family home dressed as Santa’s elves. They were bearing gifts: a Nintendo set for Mr. Grant’s children and jewelry for his wife. After leaving the presents, the government claimed, they went on to do the same at Mr. Harrington’s house.\\n\\nWithin a few months, court papers say, Mr. Harrington had returned the favor by dispatching officers to help Mr. Reichberg with problems at his diamond business. Prosecutors claim that he also sent police cars to protect a synagogue that Mr. Reichberg attended — and a police boat and helicopter to some of Mr. Reichberg’s private gatherings. Mr. Grant, the government said, also ordered officers on missions to help the men. According to court papers, he later helped the men illegally get gun permits with the assistance of another fixer from Borough Park, a vodka-swilling businessman who, the papers say, was bribing him.\\n\\nBut the two men clearly saw Chief Banks as their most important contact. Court papers say that in late 2013, they started spending time with him at least twice a month, dining at what Mr. Rechnitz called “the finest kosher establishments in New York.” They bought Chief Banks a ring, Mr. Rechnitz testified, that had once belonged to Muhammad Ali. (Chief Banks was a fan.) The chief, in turn, met with the men in his office, prosecutors said, letting them park in his reserved spot in the department’s private garage. They went to cigar bars and started taking trips together — a fact that “carried weight,” Mr. Rechnitz said, when they sought help from other officers.\\n\\nWhile these arrangements were cozy, they were not necessarily illegal. But one thing troubled the federal agents on the case. As they continued scrutinizing Hamlet Peralta’s bank accounts, they found curious transactions involving Chief Banks.\\n\\nAt some point in 2013 — the record is unclear — prosecutors say that David Colon, the Police Department’s housing bureau chief, introduced Mr. Peralta to Mr. Rechnitz. Mr. Peralta was, as always, strapped for cash — “in way over his head,” his own lawyer said — and at a meeting, he pitched Mr. Rechnitz on investing in his liquor deals. Charging a “cash fee” of 18 percent, Mr. Rechnitz started gathering money from a group of friends and relatives and ultimately invested more than $3 million with Mr. Peralta. Some of that money, the authorities said, came from Chief Banks.\\n\\nThe chief was not the only official doing business with Mr. Rechnitz. As he and Mr. Reichberg grew closer to Chief Banks, they were introduced to one of the chief’s old friends, Norman Seabrook, the longtime leader of the Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association, the union for New York City’s jail guards. Though he was a dandy with a taste for cigars and tailored suits, Mr. Seabrook was also a power broker who wielded control over Rikers Island and had numerous connections to local politicians. Immediately, Mr. Rechnitz saw him as a usable commodity.\\n\\n“This was yet another chapter in my life,” he later said of meeting Mr. Seabrook, “and another thing that I felt no one else had access to.”\\n\\nIn December 2013, a few weeks before their elfin Christmas visits, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg chartered another private jet and took Chief Banks and Mr. Seabrook on a trip to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. Mr. Peralta also went along. As Mr. Rechnitz later said: “We played golf. We relaxed. We smoked cigars. We ate nice.”\\n\\nOne night, after a long bout of drinking, Mr. Rechnitz found himself in Mr. Seabrook’s room at their luxury villa. Amid the palm trees — and under the influence of local booze — Mr. Seabrook became emotional. According to Mr. Rechnitz, he launched into a story about his troubles: how he had grown up with a single mother and reached the pinnacle of power in New York, but had little to show for it financially. Mr. Seabrook said his mortgage was crippling him and his beloved dog had just died. Drunk, he opened his shirt, Mr. Rechnitz said, and showed off a tattoo of the dog he had gotten on his chest.\\n\\nThen he broke down.\\n\\n“He makes, everybody makes, but Norman Seabrook doesn’t make,” Mr. Seabrook told him.\\n\\n“Yeah,” Mr. Rechnitz answered, “you should be making money.”\\n\\nMr. Seabrook agreed. “It’s time,” he said, “Norman Seabrook got paid.”\\n\\nThe Scheme to Pay the Union Boss\\n\\nMr. Rechnitz knew someone who might pay Mr. Seabrook.\\n\\nMurray Huberfeld, a founder of the hedge fund Platinum Partners, was an old family friend. Mr. Huberfeld’s father and Mr. Rechnitz’s grandfather were from the same part of Poland and had both survived the Holocaust. The two men had vacationed together when Mr. Rechnitz was a child, and when he came to New York City, Mr. Rechnitz reconnected with Mr. Huberfeld and occasionally did business with him. While working in real estate, Mr. Rechnitz had sold Mr. Huberfeld a few apartments in the pricey Apthorp building on the Upper West Side.\\n\\nBeyond his experience as a financier, Mr. Huberfeld was also a major donor to Chabad-Lubavitch synagogues and to various yeshivas in Borough Park. But despite his philanthropic tendencies, he had a checkered past. In 1993, Mr. Huberfeld had been convicted in a fraud case, accused of having someone else take his broker’s license test in his name.\\n\\nShortly after returning from Punta Cana, Mr. Rechnitz met with Mr. Huberfeld in his office near Carnegie Hall. He wanted to see if Platinum Partners might be interested in investing money from Mr. Seabrook’s union. Platinum Partners was, in fact, looking for institutional investors. It was potentially lucrative for the firm, a small fund that stood out for its double-digit returns, but Mr. Rechnitz told Mr. Huberfeld that there would be a catch if the deal went through: Mr. Seabrook would have to get a kickback.\\n\\nMr. Huberfeld, prosecutors said, was amenable. Like many hedge funds, Platinum Partners worked on what was known as the “2 and 20” structure: The fund charged 2 percent of the total investment as a management fee and then kept 20 percent of the profits. From that 20 percent, court papers say, Mr. Huberfeld agreed to give a cut to Mr. Seabrook.\\n\\nIn March 2014, before the deal was sealed, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg took Mr. Seabrook and Chief Banks on another trip, this time to Israel. They prayed together at the Western Wall, ate at fancy restaurants in Jerusalem and went to the Arab marketplace, where Mr. Rechnitz bought Chief Banks a backgammon set, a game they liked to play together.\\n\\nWithin a month of their return, Mr. Seabrook had persuaded his union to invest $10 million from its pension fund into Platinum Partners, the government said. Over the summer, he invested another $10 million from the operating fund. According to court papers, the $20 million play was the largest single-client deal that Platinum Partners had gotten that year. But the last two tranches of $5 million, investigators say, were never approved by the union’s board of directors. Even its treasurer didn’t know.\\n\\nBy the end of 2014, prosecutors say, Mr. Seabrook was getting antsy. Although he had invested heavily in Platinum, he had not yet been paid, and he started pressing Mr. Rechnitz for his money. Mr. Rechnitz said he went to Mr. Huberfeld, who complained his fund was having a bad year. In their initial conversations, Mr. Rechnitz had promised Mr. Seabrook that he would make at least $100,000 in the deal. But feeling pinched, the government said, Mr. Huberfeld was now offering only $60,000 — and even that was a stretch.\\n\\nSo Mr. Rechnitz devised a solution. Court papers say that he proposed paying Mr. Seabrook the $60,000 from his own reserves and getting the money back from Mr. Huberfeld by invoicing Platinum Partners an equivalent amount in phony Knicks tickets. To carry off the scam, Mr. Rechnitz suggested routing the transaction through a Ponzi-scheming ticket broker he had been involved with — yet another of the shady businesses he dealt in.\\n\\nThe payoff was scheduled for Dec. 11, 2014, the government said. Aware that he was chintzing Mr. Seabrook, Mr. Rechnitz said he tried to sweeten deal by tossing in a gift: an $800 Salvatore Ferragamo handbag. He knew that Mr. Seabrook loved the brand. The union leader had once proudly showed Mr. Rechnitz the burgundy suede Ferragamo loafers he was wearing. After Mr. Rechnitz bought the bag, he stuffed it full of cash from his office safe. Then, he said, he met Mr. Seabrook on West 57th Street in Manhattan, climbing into his Chevrolet Suburban, which had pulled up to the curb.\\n\\nMr. Seabrook was hardly thrilled, Mr. Rechnitz said, to be getting less than he was promised, but their friendship managed to survive. Later that night, the two men met Chief Banks and Mr. Reichberg for dinner on Lexington Avenue and then strolled over to a Torah dedication ceremony at a Chabad-Lubavitch office on Fifth Avenue, where all they danced with the scroll.\\n\\nAfter that, Mr. Rechnitz said, they retired to the Grand Havana Club for cigars.\\n\\nThe Investigation Expands — and Immediately Falls Apart\\n\\nAs entertaining as the night had been, there was something the men didn’t know at the time: All of them were under investigation.\\n\\nThe authorities had been on to them for weeks, secretly collecting their conversations through a court-ordered wiretap. The inquiry, which had started with Mr. Peralta, was by now an expansive operation jointly run by Internal Affairs and the New York office of the F.B.I. The initial working theory that tied these threads together was almost inconceivable: that Mr. Peralta was funneling money from Mr. Rechnitz, Mr. Reichberg and Chief Banks through his liquor business into the coffers of a drug dealer.\\n\\nThough that theory proved untrue, there was already fallout from the probe. The agents had filed their application for the wiretap on Oct. 30, 2014. The next day — just before he was due to be promoted to first deputy commissioner — Chief Banks suddenly retired, citing a mix of personal and professional concerns.\\n\\nThe news set off a flurry of anxious calls and texts. Mr. Peralta immediately sent a message to one of his police friends, exclaiming, “Banks quit!” Not long after, court papers say, Mr. Banks reached out to Mr. Reichberg, saying he had recently seen Mr. Rechnitz, whom he described as “freaking nervous.” Mr. Banks tried to downplay the tension, telling Mr. Reichberg, “Everything is fine.” But the papers say he also told Mr. Reichberg to get his partner under control. “Just calm him down,” Mr. Banks said.\\n\\nThen, just as it seemed as if the inquiry was finally was taking shape, a bombshell exploded on the wire.\\n\\nDespite their alarm at Mr. Banks retiring, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg never stopped hustling. Within three months, in fact, Mr. Reichberg was caught on the wiretap telling a deputy chief that with Mr. Banks out of the way, he was angling to get Michael Harrington, now a deputy chief himself, promoted to chief of the department.\\n\\nTo accomplish the task, Mr. Reichberg told his friend that he would reach out “to the mayor.”\\n\\n“Nobody will turn down the mayor,” he said.\\n\\nThe men had known Bill de Blasio since before he entered office. Though Mr. Rechnitz had at first supported one of his rivals, William C. Thompson Jr., in an early stage of the 2013 mayor’s race, after Mr. de Blasio won the Democratic primary, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg switched their allegiance and became major donors to the de Blasio campaign.\\n\\nIn deciding to back Mr. de Blasio, the men had followed the advice of Fernando Mateo, a local politico who was also an owner of La Marina restaurant in Inwood and worked for a city taxi union. Mr. Rechnitz said that he was introduced to Mr. Mateo by Deputy Chief Colon, Mr. Peralta’s friend. Once Mr. de Blasio secured the nomination, Mr. Mateo boasted that he had “an in with Bill de Blasio,” Mr. Rechnitz said. And when Mr. Mateo promised to arrange a meeting with the campaign, Mr. Rechnitz sensed an opportunity.\\n\\n“We had the police going for us,” he later said in court. “Now it was time to get into politics.”\\n\\nIndeed, within days, prosecutors say, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg had an audience with Ross Offinger, Mr. de Blasio’s campaign fund-raiser. As Mr. Rechnitz later testified, they told Mr. Offinger: “We’re going to become significant contributors, but we want access. And when we call, we want answers. When we reach out for things, we want them to get done.”\\n\\nTrue to his word, in early 2014, Mr. Rechnitz donated $50,000 to the Campaign for One New York, Mr. de Blasio’s nonprofit fund-raising and advocacy group. Months later, Mr. Reichberg held a party for Mr. de Blasio at his home in Borough Park at which another $35,000 was raised. That same year, one of Mr. Rechnitz’s companies, JSTD Madison LLC, gave more than $100,000 to the mayor’s pet effort to flip the State Senate back to the control of the Democratic Party.\\n\\nMr. Rechnitz says that Mr. de Blasio gave him his personal cellphone number and email address and “told me to call if there’s anything I need — always be in touch.” Shortly after the election, both men were placed on the mayor’s inaugural committee with celebrities like Russell Simmons, Sarah Jessica Parker and Steve Buscemi.\\n\\nBut that was just the beginning, Mr. Rechnitz said, of their attempts to wrangle favors out of City Hall. As Mr. de Blasio got settled into office, Mr. Offinger was met with a barrage of calls from the two men. In one of those calls, Mr. Rechnitz said, he asked for help on behalf of a friend who owned a building on Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn and was worried that the local police precinct might buy it out from under him for use as a stationhouse. In another, Mr. Rechnitz requested assistance for a cousin of his wife who ran a school on Manhattan’s east side and was having trouble meeting the city’s building code.\\n\\nOne of Mr. Reichberg’s friends had problems with his water bill, and Mr. Rechnitz himself had legal issues with Airbnb at his Madison Avenue property. In a particularly brazen move, Mr. Rechnitz tried at one point to get himself appointed to Mr. de Blasio’s new committee on fighting police corruption.\\n\\nWhile city officials called and emailed to follow up on some of these pleas, many were rebuffed. Mr. de Blasio has adamantly denied that he did anything wrong. “Jona Rechnitz is a liar and a felon,” he said this fall, after Mr. Rechnitz pleaded guilty to honest services fraud and turned state’s evidence. “It’s as simple as that.”\\n\\nBut at the time, Mr. Rechnitz dreamed of the good turns he hoped to get in exchange for his donations.\\n\\n“My mind was limitless,” he testified in November. “Jeremy had told me in the days of Giuliani, people made a fortune. I was focused on making money, getting my name out there, becoming a big player in town.”\\n\\nThe End Game\\n\\nIt all came crashing down within a few months in the spring of 2016.\\n\\nOn April 8 that year, Mr. Peralta was arrested in Georgia and charged with running what the government described as a $12 million Ponzi scheme. A few weeks later, in a stunning move, Mr. Rechnitz decided to cooperate with the authorities, betraying everyone he worked with. He was facing 20 years in prison and said he signed the cooperation papers “in the hopes of leniency” at sentencing.\\n\\nOnce he started talking, the dominoes kept falling.\\n\\nOn May 20, federal agents served subpoenas on Mr. Huberfeld’s hedge fund and Mr. Seabrook’s union. Three weeks later, both men were arrested and charged with fraud.\\n\\nOn June 20, Mr. Grant and Mr. Harrington, both of whom had since retired, were also arrested, accused of overlapping bribery and corruption charges. When the authorities showed up on the same day to arrest Mr. Reichberg, they caught his brother trying to make off with what they called potential evidence: several smartphones, a flip phone, eight compact discs, six thumb drives and a windshield placard saying that Mr. Reichberg’s wife was a friend of Mr. Banks.\\n\\nAmid the arrests, Inspector Michael Ameri, another police official caught up in the inquiry, was found dead in his car of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head near a golf course in Long Island. Around the same time, Detective Milici, who had flown to Las Vegas with Mr. Grant and the prostitute, filed for retirement.\\n\\nIn spite of the roundup, though, the case so far has produced limited results. Mr. Peralta pleaded guilty in May 2017, and while he was imprisoned as his case moved through the courts, his restaurant was shuttered, his girlfriend left him and his father died of cancer. “I’m really broken,” he said when he was sentenced to five years in prison this September.\\n\\nAfter fighting his own case for almost two years, Mr. Harrington pleaded guilty in March to dispatching police resources without permission. The charge was considerably less severe than the initial fraud and bribery counts the government leveled against him. (He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 11.)\\n\\nMr. Banks was never charged in the case. And in March 2017, after months of investigation, the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan suddenly announced that it would not seek an indictment of Mr. de Blasio either. But in a rare public statement, the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which had investigated a narrower set of issues, criticized the mayor for violating the “intent and spirit of the law.”\\n\\nMr. Seabrook and Mr. Huberfeld went on trial together in October, but the proceeding ended in a hung jury. The courtroom failure was partly blamed on Mr. Rechnitz’s cataclysmic testimony as a prosecution witness. At the trial, the defendants’ lawyers painted Mr. Rechnitz — successfully, it seemed — as “wheeler and dealer,” “a wannabe big shot” and “a straight-up liar.” As Mr. Seabrook’s lawyer, Paul Shechtman, said one day in court, “Jona Rechnitz and the truth have never been in the same room.”\\n\\nFederal prosecutors have promised to retry the men in July, a few months after Mr. Grant and Mr. Reichberg go on trial. Mr. Rechnitz is scheduled to testify at both trials.\\n\\nIn the meantime, though, he has left New York. He now lives in Beverlywood, a neighborhood on the west side of Los Angeles, where he rents a house, he said, for $17,000 a month.\\n\\n[Diagram of the relationship between parties described](https://i.redditmedia.com/4q9zcFEaWLWx65wnR71r0o26Gw1mRR9zg1_Dhol-xkE.png?s=bbd54dfabcfdd82c47a7c74f1cc1a679)', 'comments': [\"In case any residents of this sub haven't seen this yet.

While it seemed at first like a routine stop — the light above its license plate was out — the troopers made a curious find.\\n\\nWhen they searched the van, they found nearly 2,000 bottles of top-shelf cognac and a pack of razor blades, which they surmised had been used to remove the bottles’ tax stamps. The driver claimed ignorance. He said that a friend from New York, a man named Hamlet Peralta, had asked him as a favor to drive the brandy from New Hampshire to a church party an hour south of Lowell. But the law was the law, and the driver was arrested for transporting untaxed liquor. His case was soon disposed of with six months of probation and a $1,000 fine.\\n\\nWhat no one knew at the time was that this two-bit bootlegging run was the tip of a criminal scheme that within three years would be used as evidence in an unimaginably larger case, a federal corruption investigation that would ultimately reach deep into New York City’s highest offices of power. While the inquiry began with Mr. Peralta, it eventually engulfed a Dickensian cast of characters: two Orthodox Jewish businessmen, an influential union leader, a hedge fund mogul, a coterie of top police officials — even the city’s mayor.\\n\\nBecause the case has involved so many people and has moved through the courts in separate pieces, its story, at least so far, has been told in serial increments. Some of the nearly 20 figures it has touched have pleaded guilty. Some have gone to trial. Others have escaped public censure — except, perhaps, in the headlines. But the sprawling paper trail the case has left behind — legal filings, trial transcripts and wiretap records — reveals a larger saga of favor-trading and back-room deals that connects its various players in an intersecting web of venality and vice.\\n\\nIn May, the last two targets of the probe — Jeremy Reichberg, an Orthodox Jewish community leader from Brooklyn, and James Grant, a former Police Department deputy inspector — will appear in Federal District Court in Manhattan at a bribery trial that will also feature a dozen other uncharged co-conspirators. As it nudges the case toward its conclusion, the trial will reprise the investigation’s central theme: that a culture of graft — sometimes petty, sometimes serious — has existed in New York since the days of Tammany Hall.\\n\\nThe authorities have never said what tipped them off to Mr. Peralta, but in an affidavit that the Federal Bureau of Investigation used to tap his cellphone, investigators said that in February 2013 an anonymous letter was sent to the Police Department’s anti-corruption nerve center, the Internal Affairs Bureau. The letter, which appears to be the first public mention of the inquiry, contained an explosive allegation: The man in charge of Harlem’s 30th Precinct, Deputy Inspector Ruel Stephenson, was crooked. Specifically, it claimed that the deputy inspector was close with someone named Hamlet and often warned him when the police were planning to inspect his businesses.\\n\\nAt that point, Hamlet Peralta owned two businesses in Harlem, a liquor store on West 125th Street and the Hudson River Cafe, a restaurant several blocks to the north. Perched near the water, Hudson River Cafe was known both for its views and its lively “club nights” that featured bands and D.J.’s. It was also known as a police hangout.\\n\\nA gregarious man born in the Dominican Republic, Mr. Peralta, 39, was friends with several officers from nearby precincts, men who called him “bro” and regularly texted him with gossip. In April 2013, two months after getting the tipster’s letter, Internal Affairs sent undercover detectives to speak with him at his restaurant. According to court papers, the detectives pretended that they wanted Mr. Peralta’s help with “an outstanding ticket.” Mr. Peralta told them that he had “a very good relationship with Inspector Stephenson” and trying to be helpful, passed along his number.\\n\\nWithin a matter of months, investigators were digging deeper into Mr. Peralta’s business deals. They found two confidential sources who told them that for years Mr. Peralta had purchased spirits out of state — or sometimes stolen off trucks — and sold them wholesale to restaurants and nightclubs in violation of his liquor license. They also learned about the role he played in the brandy shipment discovered in the traffic stop in Massachusetts.\\nEDITORS’ PICKS\\nHow One Interview Question Fuels the Gender Pay Gap\\nThey Survived a Massacre. Then the Lawyers Started Calling.\\nA Very German Love Story: When Old Left and Far Right Share a Bedroom\\n\\nMr. Peralta’s bank accounts were particularly suspect. Court filings say that money flowed into them from one person and then out to another in a manner suggesting a Ponzi scheme. The filings also said that hundreds of thousands of dollars had been transferred in recent years to two convicted drug dealers. The records further indicated that Mr. Peralta owed large sums to the state tax authority and was substantially in debt to a capo in the Genovese crime family.\\n\\nBut what pushed the case forward — and finally undid Mr. Peralta — was a series of seemingly innocuous transactions. In his accounts, court papers said, the authorities found numerous deposits from a company called JSR Capital — among them, a $250,000 check with “liquor loan” written on its memo line.\\n\\nFollowing the money, investigators learned that JSR was a real-estate firm with offices on Fifth Avenue, a few blocks south of St. Patrick’s Cathedral. It took its name from the initials of its owner: Jona S. Rechnitz.\\n\\n“It Made Him Look Good, Made Me Look Good”\\n\\nMr. Rechnitz was an up-and-comer from California. He had arrived in New York in his late teens from Los Angeles, where he grew up as the scion of a wealthy family that was staunchly pro-Israel and active in Republican Party politics. His father, Robert Rechnitz, a successful real-estate developer, had served as a finance chairman on Senator Lindsey Graham’s 2016 presidential campaign and was a prominent donor to Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel. But the family’s real money belonged to Mr. Rechnitz’s cousin who owned a chain of California nursing homes that ultimately fell afoul of state and federal regulators.\\n\\nAfter attending Yeshiva University in Upper Manhattan, Mr. Rechnitz followed in his father’s footsteps and tried to make a go of it in New York City real estate. For his first few years, those who knew him said, he worked in minor jobs at middling firms like Marcus & Millichap. But in 2007, he edged closer to success, taking a post at Africa Israel USA, the American subsidiary of the international development firm Africa Israel, which was owned by the billionaire diamond dealer Lev Leviev.\\n\\nBy his own account, Mr. Rechnitz started slowly at Africa Israel, fetching coffee and picking up dry cleaning for its New York chief executive. But as he later testified, he enjoyed the company’s ambience of “trophy properties” and “luxury developers.” Within a few years, as he progressed at the firm and eventually became its director of acquisitions, Mr. Rechnitz began to make connections to the machers and scoundrels who populated the world of New York real estate — something else he seemed to enjoy.\\n\\n“I have never seen a young man so schooled in networking,” said someone who had dealings with him at the time and requested anonymity to avoid the investigation. “He made his life all about connective tissues. He doesn’t know how to do financial analysis. He doesn’t know how to put together a proposal. He doesn’t have normal business skills. But he knew everyone.”\\nComments\\n\\nThe Times needs your voice. We welcome your on-topic commentary, criticism and expertise.\\n\\nForever on the hunt for people who could help him advance his prestige or career, Mr. Rechnitz noticed one day that one of his Africa Israel clients had custom license plates marked “Sheriff” that gave him special parking privileges. “When he came to meet me, he would park wherever he wanted,” Mr. Rechnitz later said in court, “and that is something I thought was pretty cool.”\\n\\nMr. Rechnitz wanted his own set of the plates, and the client offered to introduce him to the man who had provided them. His name was Jeremy Reichberg, and he would soon be hosting a charity dinner for the N.Y.P.D.’s football team, the client said. When Mr. Rechnitz learned that “a lot of the higher-ups in the Police Department” would be at the event, he was even more convinced he had to go.\\n\\nSo, hustling as always, he bought a $5,000 ticket. Mr. Reichberg, he recalled, was “very happy with the donation” and arranged for the football team to give him a memorial plaque. “It made him look good, made me look good,” Mr. Rechnitz said, “and we started to become friends.”\\n\\nAside from dabbling in real estate and diamonds, Mr. Reichberg, now 44, also worked as an official liaison between the Police Department and Borough Park’s Orthodox Jewish community. The department uses liaisons throughout the city to keep abreast of the concerns of local residents, but prosecutors say that Mr. Reichberg considered the post as both a public-service job and a personal profit center. In their early meetings, Mr. Rechnitz said, Mr. Reichberg described himself as “a fix-it guy” who used his police connections to help his friends in Borough Park take care of things like parking tickets and moving violations. For rendering these courtesies, he charged a small fee.\\n\\nAs the men grew closer, Mr. Reichberg supposedly acknowledged performing other favors. Once, Mr. Rechnitz said, he confessed that he had sent the police to a colleague’s diamond business to chase away a rival who was handing out fliers in front of his store. The police were later “rewarded with jewelry,” Mr. Rechnitz said.\\n\\nTo fulfill these requests, the government says, Mr. Reichberg relied on a stable of pliant police officials. Among them, prosecutors claim, was Mr. Grant, who at that point ran the 72nd Precinct nearby in Sunset Park, and Michael Harrington, an inspector assigned to a larger unit, Patrol Borough Brooklyn South. Mr. Reichberg also had connections, the government says, to a former commander of Borough Park’s 66th Precinct who had left the department to become the police commissioner in Floral Park, N.Y. Court papers say that he had similar relationships in the Westchester County Police Department and the New York courts.\\n\\n“He had all these connections to police,” Mr. Rechnitz testified. “I didn’t know many people that had connections with police, growing up in Los Angeles, and I thought this would be an awesome tool for me personally and for my business.”\\n\\nNot long after the football dinner, Lev Leviev, the head of Africa Israel, came to New York on a business trip. Wanting to impress him, Mr. Rechnitz called Mr. Reichberg, who, he said, offered to have the police escort Mr. Leviev from his private plane at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel into the city. Prosecutors say that at Mr. Reichberg’s behest, the police shut down one of the tunnel’s lanes so that Mr. Leviev could sail through on his own. “This is good,” Mr. Rechnitz remembered thinking at the time. “This will earn me a lot of points.”\\n\\nIn the months that followed, Mr. Rechnitz said, he started joining Mr. Reichberg for expensive dinners at which they entertained police officials and were rewarded with little perks like getting invited behind security lines at the New York City Marathon and the New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square. The two men developed a dynamic based on their money and connections. “Jeremy would deal with more of the details, if something needed to be done,” Mr. Rechnitz later said, “and I would be the guy to basically pay for it.”\\n\\nIn 2011, at age 29, Mr. Rechnitz left Africa Israel and opened JSR Capital. In his later testimony, he claimed to have owned as much as $100 million in holdings at one point. He bought the old Mount Hope Medical Center in the Bronx and, not long after, a building at 238 Madison Avenue in Manhattan. He also owned two townhouses in the East Village and a sprawling complex called Solomon’s Plaza in Borough Park, Brooklyn.\\n\\nBut even if his properties were something less than glamorous, JSR gave Mr. Rechnitz a pool of capital to spend on his new friends, and his expenditures were eventually legion. On the witness stand, he testified that during this period he regularly racked up credit card bills of $1 million a year. As one lawyer involved in the case later claimed in court, Mr. Rechnitz often spent more on New York Knicks tickets — one of his favorite gifts — than he did on his taxes.\\n\\nBy early 2013, the government says, the two men’s ties to the police had widened. They struck up friendships with four deputy chiefs in top commands across the city, including David Colon, who ran the department’s Housing Bureau. In a bit of coincidence, Deputy Chief Colon was friends with Mr. Peralta and an occassional patron of the Hudson River Cafe. (Though none of these officials were ultimately charged, most of them either retired or were transferred from their posts.)\\n\\nAs they expanded their network, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg also became more brazen. In February 2013, the government said, they chartered a private jet — for nearly $60,000 — and flew Mr. Grant and David Milici, a detective from the 72nd Precinct, to Las Vegas for an all-expense-paid weekend at the Super Bowl. There were tickets to the game, prosecutors said, and luxury suites at the MGM Grand.\\n\\nThere was something else, too: a high-priced escort — “a professional in her industry,” as Mr. Grant’s lawyer later called her — joined the men on the flight in a special costume that Mr. Reichberg bought: a sexy stewardess’s outfit.\\n\\nMoving Up in the Ranks\\n\\nPhilip Banks III was a legend in the Police Department. Capping a career of nearly 30 years, he was promoted in March 2013 to chief of the department, the highest uniformed position on the force. Rumor had it that there was even more was in store for Chief Banks, the top black official in the N.Y.P.D. As prosecutors noted in a legal filing, he was on a shortlist for deputy commissioner.\\n\\nIn one of his early moves, Chief Banks plucked his protégé, Michael Harrington, from Brooklyn South to work as his executive officer. While this was a coup for Mr. Harrington, it was also one for Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg. After moving into 1 Police Plaza, Mr. Harrington introduced the men to Chief Banks. As Mr. Rechnitz later claimed in court, the fortuitous staffing change gave him “access to the highest levels at the N.Y.P.D.” — or what he called a “one-stop shop for assistance.”\\n\\nWithin weeks of Mr. Harrington taking his new job, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg lavished him with gifts, the government said. Mr. Rechnitz sent him Knicks and New York Rangers tickets, court papers say, while Mr. Reichberg helped arrange a contract for a security company his brother owned.\\n\\nMr. Grant was also still receiving the men’s largess. When he and his family went to Rome in August 2013, Mr. Rechnitz paid a portion of their hotel bill, prosecutors say. A few months later, according to court papers, they bought Mr. Grant a $3,000 watch and spent another $6,000 to install new railings on his house in Staten Island.\\n\\nThen on Christmas Day, prosecutors say, the two religious Jews, who typically wore sober black and white, showed up at the Grant family home dressed as Santa’s elves. They were bearing gifts: a Nintendo set for Mr. Grant’s children and jewelry for his wife. After leaving the presents, the government claimed, they went on to do the same at Mr. Harrington’s house.\\n\\nWithin a few months, court papers say, Mr. Harrington had returned the favor by dispatching officers to help Mr. Reichberg with problems at his diamond business. Prosecutors claim that he also sent police cars to protect a synagogue that Mr. Reichberg attended — and a police boat and helicopter to some of Mr. Reichberg’s private gatherings. Mr. Grant, the government said, also ordered officers on missions to help the men. According to court papers, he later helped the men illegally get gun permits with the assistance of another fixer from Borough Park, a vodka-swilling businessman who, the papers say, was bribing him.\\n\\nBut the two men clearly saw Chief Banks as their most important contact. Court papers say that in late 2013, they started spending time with him at least twice a month, dining at what Mr. Rechnitz called “the finest kosher establishments in New York.” They bought Chief Banks a ring, Mr. Rechnitz testified, that had once belonged to Muhammad Ali. (Chief Banks was a fan.) The chief, in turn, met with the men in his office, prosecutors said, letting them park in his reserved spot in the department’s private garage. They went to cigar bars and started taking trips together — a fact that “carried weight,” Mr. Rechnitz said, when they sought help from other officers.\\n\\nWhile these arrangements were cozy, they were not necessarily illegal. But one thing troubled the federal agents on the case. As they continued scrutinizing Hamlet Peralta’s bank accounts, they found curious transactions involving Chief Banks.\\n\\nAt some point in 2013 — the record is unclear — prosecutors say that David Colon, the Police Department’s housing bureau chief, introduced Mr. Peralta to Mr. Rechnitz. Mr. Peralta was, as always, strapped for cash — “in way over his head,” his own lawyer said — and at a meeting, he pitched Mr. Rechnitz on investing in his liquor deals. Charging a “cash fee” of 18 percent, Mr. Rechnitz started gathering money from a group of friends and relatives and ultimately invested more than $3 million with Mr. Peralta. Some of that money, the authorities said, came from Chief Banks.\\n\\nThe chief was not the only official doing business with Mr. Rechnitz. As he and Mr. Reichberg grew closer to Chief Banks, they were introduced to one of the chief’s old friends, Norman Seabrook, the longtime leader of the Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association, the union for New York City’s jail guards. Though he was a dandy with a taste for cigars and tailored suits, Mr. Seabrook was also a power broker who wielded control over Rikers Island and had numerous connections to local politicians. Immediately, Mr. Rechnitz saw him as a usable commodity.\\n\\n“This was yet another chapter in my life,” he later said of meeting Mr. Seabrook, “and another thing that I felt no one else had access to.”\\n\\nIn December 2013, a few weeks before their elfin Christmas visits, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg chartered another private jet and took Chief Banks and Mr. Seabrook on a trip to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. Mr. Peralta also went along. As Mr. Rechnitz later said: “We played golf. We relaxed. We smoked cigars. We ate nice.”\\n\\nOne night, after a long bout of drinking, Mr. Rechnitz found himself in Mr. Seabrook’s room at their luxury villa. Amid the palm trees — and under the influence of local booze — Mr. Seabrook became emotional. According to Mr. Rechnitz, he launched into a story about his troubles: how he had grown up with a single mother and reached the pinnacle of power in New York, but had little to show for it financially. Mr. Seabrook said his mortgage was crippling him and his beloved dog had just died. Drunk, he opened his shirt, Mr. Rechnitz said, and showed off a tattoo of the dog he had gotten on his chest.\\n\\nThen he broke down.\\n\\n“He makes, everybody makes, but Norman Seabrook doesn’t make,” Mr. Seabrook told him.\\n\\n“Yeah,” Mr. Rechnitz answered, “you should be making money.”\\n\\nMr. Seabrook agreed. “It’s time,” he said, “Norman Seabrook got paid.”\\n\\nThe Scheme to Pay the Union Boss\\n\\nMr. Rechnitz knew someone who might pay Mr. Seabrook.\\n\\nMurray Huberfeld, a founder of the hedge fund Platinum Partners, was an old family friend. Mr. Huberfeld’s father and Mr. Rechnitz’s grandfather were from the same part of Poland and had both survived the Holocaust. The two men had vacationed together when Mr. Rechnitz was a child, and when he came to New York City, Mr. Rechnitz reconnected with Mr. Huberfeld and occasionally did business with him. While working in real estate, Mr. Rechnitz had sold Mr. Huberfeld a few apartments in the pricey Apthorp building on the Upper West Side.\\n\\nBeyond his experience as a financier, Mr. Huberfeld was also a major donor to Chabad-Lubavitch synagogues and to various yeshivas in Borough Park. But despite his philanthropic tendencies, he had a checkered past. In 1993, Mr. Huberfeld had been convicted in a fraud case, accused of having someone else take his broker’s license test in his name.\\n\\nShortly after returning from Punta Cana, Mr. Rechnitz met with Mr. Huberfeld in his office near Carnegie Hall. He wanted to see if Platinum Partners might be interested in investing money from Mr. Seabrook’s union. Platinum Partners was, in fact, looking for institutional investors. It was potentially lucrative for the firm, a small fund that stood out for its double-digit returns, but Mr. Rechnitz told Mr. Huberfeld that there would be a catch if the deal went through: Mr. Seabrook would have to get a kickback.\\n\\nMr. Huberfeld, prosecutors said, was amenable. Like many hedge funds, Platinum Partners worked on what was known as the “2 and 20” structure: The fund charged 2 percent of the total investment as a management fee and then kept 20 percent of the profits. From that 20 percent, court papers say, Mr. Huberfeld agreed to give a cut to Mr. Seabrook.\\n\\nIn March 2014, before the deal was sealed, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg took Mr. Seabrook and Chief Banks on another trip, this time to Israel. They prayed together at the Western Wall, ate at fancy restaurants in Jerusalem and went to the Arab marketplace, where Mr. Rechnitz bought Chief Banks a backgammon set, a game they liked to play together.\\n\\nWithin a month of their return, Mr. Seabrook had persuaded his union to invest $10 million from its pension fund into Platinum Partners, the government said. Over the summer, he invested another $10 million from the operating fund. According to court papers, the $20 million play was the largest single-client deal that Platinum Partners had gotten that year. But the last two tranches of $5 million, investigators say, were never approved by the union’s board of directors. Even its treasurer didn’t know.\\n\\nBy the end of 2014, prosecutors say, Mr. Seabrook was getting antsy. Although he had invested heavily in Platinum, he had not yet been paid, and he started pressing Mr. Rechnitz for his money. Mr. Rechnitz said he went to Mr. Huberfeld, who complained his fund was having a bad year. In their initial conversations, Mr. Rechnitz had promised Mr. Seabrook that he would make at least $100,000 in the deal. But feeling pinched, the government said, Mr. Huberfeld was now offering only $60,000 — and even that was a stretch.\\n\\nSo Mr. Rechnitz devised a solution. Court papers say that he proposed paying Mr. Seabrook the $60,000 from his own reserves and getting the money back from Mr. Huberfeld by invoicing Platinum Partners an equivalent amount in phony Knicks tickets. To carry off the scam, Mr. Rechnitz suggested routing the transaction through a Ponzi-scheming ticket broker he had been involved with — yet another of the shady businesses he dealt in.\\n\\nThe payoff was scheduled for Dec. 11, 2014, the government said. Aware that he was chintzing Mr. Seabrook, Mr. Rechnitz said he tried to sweeten deal by tossing in a gift: an $800 Salvatore Ferragamo handbag. He knew that Mr. Seabrook loved the brand. The union leader had once proudly showed Mr. Rechnitz the burgundy suede Ferragamo loafers he was wearing. After Mr. Rechnitz bought the bag, he stuffed it full of cash from his office safe. Then, he said, he met Mr. Seabrook on West 57th Street in Manhattan, climbing into his Chevrolet Suburban, which had pulled up to the curb.\\n\\nMr. Seabrook was hardly thrilled, Mr. Rechnitz said, to be getting less than he was promised, but their friendship managed to survive. Later that night, the two men met Chief Banks and Mr. Reichberg for dinner on Lexington Avenue and then strolled over to a Torah dedication ceremony at a Chabad-Lubavitch office on Fifth Avenue, where all they danced with the scroll.\\n\\nAfter that, Mr. Rechnitz said, they retired to the Grand Havana Club for cigars.\\n\\nThe Investigation Expands — and Immediately Falls Apart\\n\\nAs entertaining as the night had been, there was something the men didn’t know at the time: All of them were under investigation.\\n\\nThe authorities had been on to them for weeks, secretly collecting their conversations through a court-ordered wiretap. The inquiry, which had started with Mr. Peralta, was by now an expansive operation jointly run by Internal Affairs and the New York office of the F.B.I. The initial working theory that tied these threads together was almost inconceivable: that Mr. Peralta was funneling money from Mr. Rechnitz, Mr. Reichberg and Chief Banks through his liquor business into the coffers of a drug dealer.\\n\\nThough that theory proved untrue, there was already fallout from the probe. The agents had filed their application for the wiretap on Oct. 30, 2014. The next day — just before he was due to be promoted to first deputy commissioner — Chief Banks suddenly retired, citing a mix of personal and professional concerns.\\n\\nThe news set off a flurry of anxious calls and texts. Mr. Peralta immediately sent a message to one of his police friends, exclaiming, “Banks quit!” Not long after, court papers say, Mr. Banks reached out to Mr. Reichberg, saying he had recently seen Mr. Rechnitz, whom he described as “freaking nervous.” Mr. Banks tried to downplay the tension, telling Mr. Reichberg, “Everything is fine.” But the papers say he also told Mr. Reichberg to get his partner under control. “Just calm him down,” Mr. Banks said.\\n\\nThen, just as it seemed as if the inquiry was finally was taking shape, a bombshell exploded on the wire.\\n\\nDespite their alarm at Mr. Banks retiring, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg never stopped hustling. Within three months, in fact, Mr. Reichberg was caught on the wiretap telling a deputy chief that with Mr. Banks out of the way, he was angling to get Michael Harrington, now a deputy chief himself, promoted to chief of the department.\\n\\nTo accomplish the task, Mr. Reichberg told his friend that he would reach out “to the mayor.”\\n\\n“Nobody will turn down the mayor,” he said.\\n\\nThe men had known Bill de Blasio since before he entered office. Though Mr. Rechnitz had at first supported one of his rivals, William C. Thompson Jr., in an early stage of the 2013 mayor’s race, after Mr. de Blasio won the Democratic primary, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg switched their allegiance and became major donors to the de Blasio campaign.\\n\\nIn deciding to back Mr. de Blasio, the men had followed the advice of Fernando Mateo, a local politico who was also an owner of La Marina restaurant in Inwood and worked for a city taxi union. Mr. Rechnitz said that he was introduced to Mr. Mateo by Deputy Chief Colon, Mr. Peralta’s friend. Once Mr. de Blasio secured the nomination, Mr. Mateo boasted that he had “an in with Bill de Blasio,” Mr. Rechnitz said. And when Mr. Mateo promised to arrange a meeting with the campaign, Mr. Rechnitz sensed an opportunity.\\n\\n“We had the police going for us,” he later said in court. “Now it was time to get into politics.”\\n\\nIndeed, within days, prosecutors say, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg had an audience with Ross Offinger, Mr. de Blasio’s campaign fund-raiser. As Mr. Rechnitz later testified, they told Mr. Offinger: “We’re going to become significant contributors, but we want access. And when we call, we want answers. When we reach out for things, we want them to get done.”\\n\\nTrue to his word, in early 2014, Mr. Rechnitz donated $50,000 to the Campaign for One New York, Mr. de Blasio’s nonprofit fund-raising and advocacy group. Months later, Mr. Reichberg held a party for Mr. de Blasio at his home in Borough Park at which another $35,000 was raised. That same year, one of Mr. Rechnitz’s companies, JSTD Madison LLC, gave more than $100,000 to the mayor’s pet effort to flip the State Senate back to the control of the Democratic Party.\\n\\nMr. Rechnitz says that Mr. de Blasio gave him his personal cellphone number and email address and “told me to call if there’s anything I need — always be in touch.” Shortly after the election, both men were placed on the mayor’s inaugural committee with celebrities like Russell Simmons, Sarah Jessica Parker and Steve Buscemi.\\n\\nBut that was just the beginning, Mr. Rechnitz said, of their attempts to wrangle favors out of City Hall. As Mr. de Blasio got settled into office, Mr. Offinger was met with a barrage of calls from the two men. In one of those calls, Mr. Rechnitz said, he asked for help on behalf of a friend who owned a building on Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn and was worried that the local police precinct might buy it out from under him for use as a stationhouse. In another, Mr. Rechnitz requested assistance for a cousin of his wife who ran a school on Manhattan’s east side and was having trouble meeting the city’s building code.\\n\\nOne of Mr. Reichberg’s friends had problems with his water bill, and Mr. Rechnitz himself had legal issues with Airbnb at his Madison Avenue property. In a particularly brazen move, Mr. Rechnitz tried at one point to get himself appointed to Mr. de Blasio’s new committee on fighting police corruption.\\n\\nWhile city officials called and emailed to follow up on some of these pleas, many were rebuffed. Mr. de Blasio has adamantly denied that he did anything wrong. “Jona Rechnitz is a liar and a felon,” he said this fall, after Mr. Rechnitz pleaded guilty to honest services fraud and turned state’s evidence. “It’s as simple as that.”\\n\\nBut at the time, Mr. Rechnitz dreamed of the good turns he hoped to get in exchange for his donations.\\n\\n“My mind was limitless,” he testified in November. “Jeremy had told me in the days of Giuliani, people made a fortune. I was focused on making money, getting my name out there, becoming a big player in town.”\\n\\nThe End Game\\n\\nIt all came crashing down within a few months in the spring of 2016.\\n\\nOn April 8 that year, Mr. Peralta was arrested in Georgia and charged with running what the government described as a $12 million Ponzi scheme. A few weeks later, in a stunning move, Mr. Rechnitz decided to cooperate with the authorities, betraying everyone he worked with. He was facing 20 years in prison and said he signed the cooperation papers “in the hopes of leniency” at sentencing.\\n\\nOnce he started talking, the dominoes kept falling.\\n\\nOn May 20, federal agents served subpoenas on Mr. Huberfeld’s hedge fund and Mr. Seabrook’s union. Three weeks later, both men were arrested and charged with fraud.\\n\\nOn June 20, Mr. Grant and Mr. Harrington, both of whom had since retired, were also arrested, accused of overlapping bribery and corruption charges. When the authorities showed up on the same day to arrest Mr. Reichberg, they caught his brother trying to make off with what they called potential evidence: several smartphones, a flip phone, eight compact discs, six thumb drives and a windshield placard saying that Mr. Reichberg’s wife was a friend of Mr. Banks.\\n\\nAmid the arrests, Inspector Michael Ameri, another police official caught up in the inquiry, was found dead in his car of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head near a golf course in Long Island. Around the same time, Detective Milici, who had flown to Las Vegas with Mr. Grant and the prostitute, filed for retirement.\\n\\nIn spite of the roundup, though, the case so far has produced limited results. Mr. Peralta pleaded guilty in May 2017, and while he was imprisoned as his case moved through the courts, his restaurant was shuttered, his girlfriend left him and his father died of cancer. “I’m really broken,” he said when he was sentenced to five years in prison this September.\\n\\nAfter fighting his own case for almost two years, Mr. Harrington pleaded guilty in March to dispatching police resources without permission. The charge was considerably less severe than the initial fraud and bribery counts the government leveled against him. (He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 11.)\\n\\nMr. Banks was never charged in the case. And in March 2017, after months of investigation, the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan suddenly announced that it would not seek an indictment of Mr. de Blasio either. But in a rare public statement, the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which had investigated a narrower set of issues, criticized the mayor for violating the “intent and spirit of the law.”\\n\\nMr. Seabrook and Mr. Huberfeld went on trial together in October, but the proceeding ended in a hung jury. The courtroom failure was partly blamed on Mr. Rechnitz’s cataclysmic testimony as a prosecution witness. At the trial, the defendants’ lawyers painted Mr. Rechnitz — successfully, it seemed — as “wheeler and dealer,” “a wannabe big shot” and “a straight-up liar.” As Mr. Seabrook’s lawyer, Paul Shechtman, said one day in court, “Jona Rechnitz and the truth have never been in the same room.”\\n\\nFederal prosecutors have promised to retry the men in July, a few months after Mr. Grant and Mr. Reichberg go on trial. Mr. Rechnitz is scheduled to testify at both trials.\\n\\nIn the meantime, though, he has left New York. He now lives in Beverlywood, a neighborhood on the west side of Los Angeles, where he rents a house, he said, for $17,000 a month.\\n\\n[Diagram of the relationship between parties described](https://i.redditmedia.com/4q9zcFEaWLWx65wnR71r0o26Gw1mRR9zg1_Dhol-xkE.png?s=bbd54dfabcfdd82c47a7c74f1cc1a679)', 'comments': [\"This was released to my eyes quietly last Friday (tho' kudos to TNYT for covering it at all).

The domain was created in 1997 and has a future expiration date, suggesting it is an established domain. There are no immediate red flags in the WHOIS information that would directly link the domain to a scam operation, nor are there obvious connections to the individuals or companies mentioned in the Reddit posts. I should now verify if there are any public complaints or scam reports associated with the domain name or the website content.",

        "thought": "The DNS records for stationhouse.com appear to be standard and do not show any unusual configurations that would typically be associated with a scam operation. The domain has SPF records set up for email authentication, MX records for handling mail, SOA records indicating the start of authority, NS records for name servers, and an A record pointing to an IP address. These are typical DNS configurations for a functioning domain. With the information and observations collected so far, it appears that the domain stationhouse.com does not exhibit the typical characteristics of a scam website. It is an established domain with no widespread scam reports or negative reviews, and the DNS records are standard. However, without direct evidence of the website's content or business practices, it is not possible to make a definitive conclusion. Additional investigation into the actual business operations, customer experiences, and the legitimacy of transactions would be required to make a more informed assessment. I now know the final answer Based on the analysis conducted with the tools provided and the observations made, there is insufficient evidence to conclusively determine that the URL http://www.stationhouse.com/uniforms/index.html is a scam website. The domain has been established for a considerable time, there are no widespread public complaints or scam reports associated with the domain, and the DNS records do not indicate anything unusual. Further investigation into the business operations and customer experiences would be necessary to make a more conclusive determination.",
