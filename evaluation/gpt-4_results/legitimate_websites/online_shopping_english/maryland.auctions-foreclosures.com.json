Everyone will want to take advantage of this historic chapter.

[🗽 The Investing Series 🗽 1 of 11: 🐹 \"The Hamster Technique\" © 🐹](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/vfhcyq/the_investing_series_1_of_11_the_hamster_technique/)\\n2.

We talked about arbitrage of assets before, during, and after this phase, and how to profit.  We discussed historical examples such as the French Revolution (1789-1799), Hungary (1930-1946), and modern types of hyperinflation with \"stablecoins\" (*and now, as you very-well have learned, they are not so stable: provided that after LUNA collapsed, FTX too collapsed - Now most U.S.-based crypto businesses are being overrun by the Western Governments\\' tentacles.  Bittrex is now gone too, Coinbase is now under the SEC\\'s crosshairs, U.S.-based staking has been outlawed, and Binance will be next to go*).\\n\\nBefore we discuss bank-related risks of this fiat-to-digital financial duality, let\\'s discuss relevant facts from history: the origins of the stock market:\\n\\nThe history of equities markets can really be divided into four eras: the period of **Mercantilism** (1600-1799) during which a few international trade companies dominated stock exchanges, **Antebellum** or **Free Trade (1800-1914)** during which railroads, finance and other industries grew in size, **Regulation** (1914-1981) during which government regulation and nationalizations restricted the growth of global stock markets, and **Globalization** (1981-) during which markets *once again* became a source of capital for global corporations.\\n\\n# This is an hour-long history lesson, in chronological order:\\n\\nThis writeup, focuses on an acute period within the early Antebellum / Free Trade period from 1776-1841.  *Keep today\\'s market backdrop in mind while you read this.*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# The Initial U.S. Stock Market - Born as you guessed: on Insider Trading, and Rife with Insidious Fraud (1776-1792)\\n\\n>*\"I dined with Hamilton on Saturday. He is strong in the faith on maintaining public Credit...I tried him on the subject...\\'they must no doubt be funded though it cannot be done immediately,\\' was his remark.\"*  \\n>  \\n>\\\\- A letter from William Constable, a Wall Street broker wrote to his colleague Andrew Craigie  in late 1789.  **Craigie and his partners owned $100,000 in state debt.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# The Bank of New York, founded by Alexander Hamilton (1784)\\n\\nThe original Bank of New York was founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton following the Revolutionary war, a time of chaos.  At that time there was only one bank in North America located in Philadelphia, a time where it was very difficult to conduct business.\\n\\n# \"The First Bernie Madoff\" was William Duer\\n\\nAlexander Hamilton\\'s newfound Treasury department was *not clean*.  William Duer, Hamilton\\'s first Treasury secretary, was buying up deeply discounted debt while serving.  Even by 18th century standards, his \"*extensive investment in public securities*\" went too far.\\n\\n# In those days the 1st U.S. Congress convened on Wall Street, in Federal Hall (1789-1791)\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rpx0yvgnvkra1.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=92711970834dc5d9b98f49f72e2851ff2cf9fbaf\\n\\nWilliam Duer, after personal conflict with Hamilton, resigned in April 1790.  After leaving office, the Treasury veteran would stoke Wall Street\\'s first speculative bubble, *backing Hamilton into a corner* *and forcing him to set off the Street\\'s first panic:*\\n\\nWhen he resigned from the Treasury Department, William Duer was one of the richest men in the new republic, perhaps due to savvy investments in soon-to-be-funded war-era debt.  Not ready to retire completely, he wanted revenge against Hamilton *for some reason*.  He hatched a plan to corner the market in shares of the Bank of New York (Hamilton\\'s local state bank).  These shares had already been the subject of **a** **brief speculative mania in 1791 because Hamilton structured them so investors could buy immediately and pay in installments.**\\n\\n# The First U.S. Stock Market Crash (1791)\\n\\nWilliam Duer *fraudulently-convinced* early investors on Wall Street that \"a *rival bank\"* was in the works, thereby driving down the price of shares in Hamilton\\'s bank.  Meanwhile, Duer bought up as many of the discounted shares as possible, planning to let the *rival bank rumor* die and wait for the stock to appreciate again, before profiting on the sales.\\n\\n# The First Bank of the United States (1791)\\n\\nThe First Bank of the United States was needed, **on paper**, because the government had ***a debt from the Revolutionary War***, and each state had a different form of currency.  This bank was built while Philadelphia was still the nation\\'s capital.  Alexander Hamilton conceived of the bank to \"handle the *colossal war debt\"* — and to **create** *a standard form of currency.  More importantly, however, it was clearly and obviously made to bail out his failing Bank of New York.*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Following the Bank of North America, which was technically the nation\\'s first de facto national bank, this bank was invented by Alexander Hamilton and chartered by the United States Congress on February 25, 1791. It was called the First Bank of the United States.](https://preview.redd.it/ewl9sl13ukra1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=9350ea336e10725fc2a670e8f7cbaa23bec13d19)\\n\\n# Duer then sought out to \"effectively own the stock and the bond markets.\" (1791-1792)\\n\\nDuer borrowed with reckless abandon to finance his scheme.  When the state-level banks stopped lending to him, he turned to friends.  When they\\'d had enough, he took high-interest loans from the better part of New York\\'s population.  The bubble that resulted in early 1792 dwarfed the previous year\\'s.  Hamilton was appalled.  Letters circulated, referring to the new type of projects as \"*in every way pernicious*,\" since they gave \"*a wild air to everything*\" and \"*jeopardized the whole system of public credit.*\"  With Hamilton\\'s newfound blessing, the Bank of New York **and** the First Bank of the United States pulled the punch bowl, **calling in loans and cutting back on new credit issues.**\\n\\nDuer\\'s creditors—that is, the whole city—suddenly felt squeezed. Some were forced to sell assets to pay the banks. His situation wasn\\'t helped by the fact the market for his borrowed securities had evaporated, along with any willingness to lend.\\n\\n# The Second U.S. Stock Market Crash (1792)\\n\\nWilliam Duer defaulted in March 1792, and the city\\'s economy went into freefall.  **He had taken money from \"shopkeepers, widows, orphans, Butchers, Carmen, market women & even the noted Bawd, Mrs. Macarty,**\" according to the contemporary observer, Alexander Maxcomb, who also wrote:\\n\\n>*\"Every countenance is gloomy, all confidence between individuals is lost, credit is at a stand, and distress and general Bankruptcy to be daily expected – for everyone gambled more or less in these cursed Speculations.\"*\\n\\nThis crash was precipitated by easy-loan policy on the part of the First Bank of the United States, and as exacerbated by William Duer\\'s attempt to corner \\'retail\\' participants in the securities market.  *When these attempts failed*, Duer defaulted on his loans, it caused a run on the banks and a panicked selling of securities, causing a crash.\\n\\nDuer eventually died **in debtor\\'s prison (a concept** ***to be detailed later in this writeup***) in 1799, after several failed attempts from lynch mobs to pull him out of jail with attempts to murder him.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# The New \"Stock Market\", i.e. the Buttonwood Agreement, Created for Exclusivity, among Brokers only, to try to ensure that they would be exclusively-protected from similar losses (1792)\\n\\nThe Buttonwood Agreement came about in direct response to this Financial Panic of 1792.\\n\\nBy extending credit and cash to local banks, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton managed to contain the crisis by May. But the young U.S. and its financial system had been badly rattled, and many in the investment community felt there was a need to re-establish trust in the marketplace, and to safeguard investors\\' interests.\\n\\nThe agreement aimed to create trust, only among themselves in the club of 24 \\'*Crème de la crème*\\' of brokers, in the system whereby the brokers and merchants would only trade with each other and charge a set commission for their services, in order to protect themselves from every other type of merchant and retail/household investor.  Their goal was to ensure that they would be protected, at the expense of everyone else, during any future market downturn - an exclusive club for their own safeguard at the expense of lay people.\\n\\nOn May 17, 1792, back when Wall Street had more trees than skyscrapers, they historically met under a *Buttonwood* tree outside 68 Wall Street.  When they decided to make their cooperation official, they signed the agreement under the tree and named the document *the Buttonwood Agreement* where they were sitting/standing in the shade.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Wall Street, NY, circa 1792.  The Buttonwood Agreement stated that all the 24 brokers would trade securities on a controlled, commission basis.  Additionally, the brokers agreed to only deal with each other, making \\'auctioneers\\' and other free-market\\\\/household participants of the time obsolete in the process](https://preview.redd.it/t5qb3bx97kra1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=418a4201988873016561214b9641449bf6086aa9)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# U.S. Relations with Great Britain (1800-1811)\\n\\nThe U.S. was booming economically after its independence.  There are several historical examples of deglobalization, but I argue that this situation was the first \\'Western\\' example (where \\'Western\\' can be defined as economic relations between the U.S. and Europe)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Thomas Jefferson\\n\\nThomas Jefferson was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and \\'founding father\\' who served as the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809.\\n\\n[Thomas Jefferson, circa 1800](https://preview.redd.it/1nogl1w24kra1.jpg?width=465&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8b54e6fd8e4448f40db0dcbec07383def132a6c)\\n\\nHis goal was an expansion of free trade, via Great Britain\\'s lifting of trade restrictions placed against the U.S.  However, to pressure Britain, he adopted *anti-foreign trade policies* such as the Embargo Act of 1807 and the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809.  These policies were *unpopular* among Northeastern U.S. *merchants and shippers*.  Jefferson\\'s successor would continue his *anti-economic policies*.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Meanwhile - the Brokers, under the Buttonwood Agreement, continued selling stocks to unsuspecting American investors, usually at the Tontine Coffee House on Wall Street, NYC\\n\\n[Situated at 82 Wall Street, on the north-west corner of Water Street, the sketchy Tontine Coffee House was built by a group of stockbrokers to serve as \\\\\\\\\"a meeting place for trade and correspondence\\\\\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/n85mpcl9okra1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a6713abbac15754bb2defc946baaf7c29a48938)\\n\\n# \\n\\n# Liquidation of the First Bank of the United States (1811)\\n\\nThomas Jefferson had fully objected to the first charter in 1791 of the bank.  Yet, its charter was now facing its 20 year expiration.  The charter ceased in 1811 when Jeffersonian-advocates refused to pass a new federal charter.\\n\\n# After the Liquidation\\n\\n[At this point, the nation had no wide-ranging financial strategy. The federal government\\'s revenue largely came from customs duties and land sales, but a possible war would mean that revenue from these sources would completely nosedive. There was literally no federal taxation of income since the Bank of the United States\\' charter had been allowed to run out in 1811, depriving the government of a major source of loans and credit.  The nation had no alternative but to launch into a War, which it obviously did next:](https://preview.redd.it/f5k8m5fhzkra1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=119de2a40e3c7523fde268a87fcd4c4bccbe1dca)\\n\\n# The War of 1812\\n\\nAlthough the *popularized-cause* for the U.S. entering the war of 1812 was seamen being impressed into the Royal Navy, it becomes clear that the war was instead the result of financial, economic warfare.  It became a real threat to the longevity of the U.S.: there was an idea of New England, the Federalists\\' main base, seceding from the union and creating a new country.  This was due to those first *deglobalizational* economic policies.\\n\\nWhen James Madison was re-elected in 1812 the discontent in New England intensified.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[The War of 1812 lasted 32 months following the U.S. declaration of war on Britain in June 1812. That’s longer than the Mexican-American War, Spanish-American War, and U.S. involvement in World War I.](https://preview.redd.it/30kgot6amjra1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c595f7d908ab40dc83e4e8e6bb5bf3763922209e)\\n\\nThe instance of anti-trade policies by Jefferson and then Madison, for many years, led to continued geopolitical conflict (*the prolonged war of 1812 as well as the Napoleanic wars across the Atlantic*), put undo pressure on American workers, who couldn\\'t get ahead no matter how hard they worked to pay for common essentials.\\n\\nBritain waged in this war against the U.S. here and invaded the U.S. (*again*).  “The President’s House” (*as it was then known prior to being known as the White House*) was burnt down.  The books burned at Congress’s library were replaced by Thomas Jefferson, whose wide-ranging collection became the foundation for today’s comprehensive Library of Congress.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Britain would engage in War to offset Jefferson and Madison\\'s anti-economic policies \\\\(I argue that this is the first instance of Western Deglobalization\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xaao19r0ljra1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=05ea9846c05a24b4e86f670985e5981002b59a9d)\\n\\nIn late 1813 Madison signed a *more restrictive* embargo act than any of those approved by Jefferson, this time prohibiting all trade between American ports (the coastal trade) and fishing outside harbors.  By the summer of 1814, the war had turned against Americans.\\n\\nIn December 1814, twenty-six Federalists called a meeting in Connecticut to discuss the economic tumult. At the Hartford Convention, some attendees issued calls for New England to secede from the United States. But the tactic backfired: by suggesting secession during wartime and condemning the new American government, Federalists appeared unpatriotic. The Hartford Convention discredited the Federalist Party and sowed the seeds for the party’s demise.\\n\\nThis *actually-long* war is what led to the creation of the U.S. National Anthem at Ft. McHenry; Francis Scott Key famously saw the American flag flying over Fort McHenry amid the “*rockets’ red glare*” and “*bombs bursting in air*.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Meanwhile - London Exchange was rife with Market Manipulation - The Great Exchange Fraud of 1814\\n\\nFor as long as they have existed, stock markets have attracted price manipulators.  An early stock exchange scam is a tale of greed, deceit and public humiliation.  In February 1814, \"*news*\" arrived that the French had been defeated and people masquerading as officers yelling \"*Napolean is dead!*\".  By the time the London Stock Exchange opened, London was full of rumors of a great allied victory, the price of stocks and government bonds rose rapidly; the syndicate of speculators took the opportunity to offload its recently acquired holding at highly favorable prices, before news of the scam trickled, and prices tanked.\\n\\n[London Stock Exchange, circa 1814 - Rife with Fraud and market manipulation](https://preview.redd.it/silsjs1q9kra1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01dc7027ddb405f4765bc37728ac7bf7c5d1b29a)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# The End of the War was the Treaty of Ghent in 1815\\n\\nThe disastrous Hartford Convention of 1814 aided in the Federalists’ demise (the party largely ceased to exist in national politics thereafter).  *i.e. don\\'t try to secede from the union!*\\n\\nWith the signing of the Treaty of Ghent in 1815 and the stunning American victory at the important Battle of New Orleans, the nation experienced a surge in nationalism.  The victory restored national honor, despite an overall disappointing war that resolved little with Great Britain.\\n\\nThe Federalist departure led to the election of James Monroe in 1816 and effectively established what is considered to be the only national one-party situation in American history.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the War, the U.S. entered what’s been coined as the “Era of Good Feelings.\"  (can\\'t make this up)  It lasted from roughly 1815 to about 1818.  You\\'ll see below what most-likely caused it to end.\\n\\n# The Second Bank of the United States (1816)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[The Second Bank of the United States was chartered for many of the same reasons as its predecessor, the First Bank of the United States. The War of 1812 had left a formidable debt. Inflation surged ever upward due to the ever-increasing number of notes issued by private banks that were operating as sole proprietorships, with no federal connection. Specie was jealously hoarded, and thus President Madison signed a bill authorizing the 2nd Bank in 1816 with a charter lasting 20 years.](https://preview.redd.it/ngbn0ix9skra1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cc6eeaef2755fd35ac2dce4a98ecc7f1b34d228)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# The Stock Market Panic of 1816-1817\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Following the War of 1812, cotton prices collapsed due to lack of demand for the cotton \\\\(perhaps due to less purchasing of military uniforms\\\\).  Yet the Second Bank of the U.S. was just established... There was then an unexplained rise and fall in the availability of credit, liquidity, and a number of foreclosures of farms throughout the country.](https://preview.redd.it/nt6m40uxdpra1.png?width=1033&format=png&auto=webp&s=8696f38e68bd494a140f026d77962e8a8297e54d)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWith the end of the *War of 1812* in 1815, the securities market in New York City began to grow.  Bank and insurance stocks were added to government bonds as part of the trades.  Yet, the *inflationary bubble also* grew from 1815 to 1817, obscuring the general deflationary trends in world prices.\\n\\nMost stock market history lessons will tell you something like, \"*by 1817, the stock market was active enough to encourage the brokers to create a formal organization.\"*  **This is not true.  The Second Bank of the United States was chartered on April 10, 1816, and using its immediate supply (*****the capitalization for the second Bank was $35 million, considerably higher than the $10 million underwriting of the first Bank*****) made cheap loans to the public, both businesses and individuals**.  As soon as July 1816, investors could buy subscriptions, sales were held **in twenty cities.**\\n\\nIt\\'s *clear and obvious* that these low interest-rate loans were used to invest by the initial investors where stock brokers were doing business.  **This caused immediate speculation and irresponsibility in the unregulated stock market across Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[As you can see from the charts, there was a clear and immediate speculative stock market bubble that was created, and it crashed in a few months- from late 1816 to 1817 that wiped out investors in what few stocks were available \\\\(mainly stocks of small private banks, state-backed banks, and transport stocks\\\\).](https://preview.redd.it/nekznlnyvlra1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf324fbf0a025dfa62687b4ad61d5a48b4576343)\\n\\n# The birth of the New York Stock and Exchange Board, i.e. the founding of the NYSE (1817)\\n\\nThe same Buttonwood group of Brokers (*who had been meeting at coffee shops*) is *known* to have **sent members to observe/spy on Philadelphia** brokers (*they suspected fraud among themselves and other brokers in Philadelphia and Boston, since they were essentially wiped out by the stock market panic of 1816-1817.  Note that the Second Bank of the United States had just been launched in 1816 in Philadelphia.  The free-money, new-bank-lending-driven bubble had just burst as soon as it was formed*).\\n\\nThis same Buttonwood group of Brokers met \\'officially\\' on March 8, 1817, **and created new guidelines they called their own constitution**.  Among these was the restriction of *most known-kinds* of manipulative trading.  They then formed the New York Stock and Exchange Board to add legitimacy to their earlier buttonwood agreement.\\n\\nThe new stock exchange rented a room at 40 Wall Street where the brokers would eventually gather twice a day to trade a list of 30 stocks and bonds.  The number and variety of securities traded at the NYSE steadily increased as America grew, such as with Erie Canal shares, railroad shares, etc.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# The Bank Panic (Bank Run of 1819)\\n\\nThe Supreme Court (McCulloch v. Maryland, 1819) held that the Constitution had granted Congress the implied power to create a central bank and that the states could not legitimately constrain that power.  This decision did not settle the controversy, however.  State banks and western entrepreneurs continued to criticize the Bank as an instrument of federal control and mismanagement.\\n\\n**The onset of the first free-market financial panic** has been variously described as \"**triggered**\", \"**pricked**\", or \"**precipitated**\" by the Second Bank of the United States *when it initiated a sharp credit contraction beginning in the summer of 1818 in order to combat the high inflation that it had itself-caused.*\\n\\nThe bank failed to control paper money printing/issuance from its branch banks, contributing to the post-war *speculative bubble*.  When markets collapsed, the bank came under criticism for its belated **tight money policies**—policies that exacerbated mass unemployment and plunging property values.*Further, it transpired that branch directors had engaged in fraud and larceny.*\\n\\nIn 1819 a financial banking panic swept across the country.  Deglobalization forces from the War of 1812 finally brought trade an abrupt halt.  Unemployment mounted, **banks failed**, **mortgages were foreclosed**, and **agricultural prices fell by half**.\\n\\n[The panic was frightening in its scope and impact, and came with an associated housing market collapse.  In New York State, property values fell by 20&#37;. In Richmond, property values fell by 50&#37;. In Pennsylvania, land values plunged from $150 an acre in 1815 to $35 in 1819 \\\\(nearly 80&#37; collapse\\\\).](https://preview.redd.it/tifcwwbdyjra1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12185feabc01ab40826aa0734b559d3150e11eb2)\\n\\nFor the first time in American history, the problem of urban poverty commanded public attention.  Half a million people were jobless nationwide (about 22% unemployment). To address the problem of destitution, newspapers appealed for old clothes and shoes for the poor, and churches and municipal governments distributed soup. Baltimore set up 12 soup kitchens in 1820 to give food to the poor.   Bank failures would continue until 1821.\\n\\nThe panic had several causes, including **a rapid expansion and subsequent contraction of credit** by the newfound **Second** **Bank of the United States,** which was designed ***to curb inflation***, an 1817 congressional order requiring **hard-currency payments** for land purchases, and the closing of many factories **due to foreign competition.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[The Bank Panic of 1819 was caused by a contraction of credit by the Bank of the United States designed to curb inflation, and currency pressures by foreign competition](https://preview.redd.it/9xnxgsi0yjra1.png?width=698&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8d5fc8e8fd186a8c6f7fafaa7e179753bad84aa)\\n\\nIn Cincinnati, bankruptcy sales occurred almost daily.  Matthew Carey, a Philadelphia economist, estimated that 3 million people, **one-third of the nation\\'s population**, were adversely affected by the panic.  Then, in 1820, John C. Calhoun commented: \"*There has been within these two years an immense revolution of fortunes in every part of the Union; enormous numbers of persons utterly ruined; multitudes in deep distress*.\"\\n\\nAt this time, **In Philadelphia, 1,808 individuals were committed to debtors\\' prison.  In Boston, the figure was 3,500.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Debtors\\' Prison: which jailed ANYONE with debt over 60 cents, including common folk, elected officials, and bank executives\\n\\nThe downswing spread like a plague across the country.  About 10,000 people from Philadelphia, Boston, and New York were sent to Debtors\\' Prison.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Imprisonment for indebtedness was commonplace.  In many jurisdictions, debtors were not freed until they acquired outside funds to pay what they owed, or else worked off the debt through years of penal labor. As a result, many languished in prison – and died there – for the crime of their indigence.](https://preview.redd.it/0f936inb1kra1.jpg?width=940&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=249acc3917e4021824cbb112f38017e1ab245807)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTwo signatories of the Declaration of Independence, James Wilson, an associate justice of the Supreme Court, and Robert Morris, a close friend of George Washington’s, spent time in jail after neglecting loans.  Yet, for those without friends in high places, *debtors’ imprisonment could turn into a life sentence*.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[“Debtors’ prisons” were brick-and-mortar facilities that were designed explicitly and exclusively for jailing negligent borrowers – some of whom owed no more than 60 cents. These dungeons, such as Walnut Street Debtors’ Prison in Philadelphia and the New Gaol in downtown Manhattan, were modeled after debtors’ prisons in London, like the “Clink” \\\\(the origin of the expression “in the clink”\\\\). ](https://preview.redd.it/itnp20jdzjra1.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2f5ddd01698f4361069dbda27a6ebedadf5bf8f)\\n\\nDebtors’ prisons were eventually banned under federal law in 1833.  Yet, Debtors prisons were not legally outlawed in the U.S. until the Supreme Court abolished them in 1883.  The Supreme Court affirmed that incarcerating indigent debtors was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection clause.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# DeGlobalization\\'s Relatively Long Term Impact on the newfound NYSE:  Subdued Markets (1820s)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[The stock market remained subdued for the first 15 years or so after the initial collapse of securities markets from 1816-1817 that led to the dawn of the NYSE.

Clay persuaded the Bank’s president, Nicholas Biddle, to apply early for rechartering, thus injecting the issue into the campaign.  ***Congress approved the renewal***, but Jackson (*who, like Jefferson, distrusted banks*) vetoed it, campaigned on the issue, and took his electoral victory as a mandate for action.  Starting in 1833, he removed all federal funds from the Bank.\\n\\nWhen its charter expired in 1836, the Second Bank ended its operations as a nationally-sanctioned institution.  It ran temporarily as a commercial bank under the laws of Pennsylvania, where it continued to operate until its failure in 1841.\\n\\nThe Civil War Era then, obviously, began in 1844, which then had its own debt-bank-war loop failures (i.e. National Bank Act to fund the debts of that war), not to mention the egregious-hyperinflation and failure of the \\'Confederate dollar\\', and so on, and so forth.\\n\\n***Is there anything that makes today\\'s \"Federal Reserve Bank\" any different than this proven-to-always-fail central banking system?  \\\\*You be the active spectator, and subsequent judge, of that.\\\\****\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Standing Remnants of repeat debt-bank-war loop failures:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[ Albeit now simply an artifact, the building of the First Bank of the United States withers away, in Philadelphia.  \\\\(compare\\\\/verify with the historical images of the bank shown above\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/vlhzfsejukra1.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=fee327e78675e750163a1c79469a9a0921f881cf)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[ Albeit now simply an artifact, the building of the Second Bank of the United States withers away, in Philadelphia.  \\\\(compare\\\\/verify with the historical images of the bank shown above\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/j5fs5j3jtkra1.jpg?width=3019&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a6ba81e10f34eb460d1ffb47efe468fd4957d19)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Lessons Learned:\\n\\n**Nothing was learned from the past** \\\\- the story above shows the same exact problems of 200 years ago are being perfectly-repeated today.  ***Nations are still engaged in a perpetual loop of irresponsibility and fraud***:  where banks are chartered to print currency while also essentially ripping the population of its wealth (even imprisoning the population).\\n\\nBank existence correlates with irresponsible lending, credit bubbles, with only temporary expansion of commerce, landgrabs, and innovations.  When this credit gets too high, from cheap-money lending, *there is always a liquidity recoil, or shock.*  This shock then *always* wipes out global equities markets, because they are caused by global equities markets having too much borrowed money *from the banks*.  Yet, nations engage in immediate **war** to counteract the financial fallout of these market and banking repeat-failures.  Further debt from funding such wars is then used as justification for creation of a new bank, with new national currencies, and so on, and so forth.\\n\\nThe system of today is just as bad, if not worse, than the same system from the early 1800s.  The purpose of this writeup is to prove that major change in this system **needs** to be done for the future - *for embarrassment\\'s sake*.  Everyone reading should be *fully* embarrassed: at the failure of their elected leaders over the past TEN 20-year generations to learn from the same repeated mistakes... where which we have failed to learn from the same mistakes over **200 years.**\\n\\n**National Banks Do Not Work.  Not then, not now.  Not ever.  And now, clearly, this current wave of national (and global) bank failures will be met with the illicit creation of yet another banking wave, albeit with a newly-printed currency just as before (in this case, the digital dollar, also known as CBDC) and the same thing will continue to happen unless we finally stick with a currency for humanity that has a supply cap.**\\n\\n*Now sit back and watch (or perhaps even participate in any associated failure category) while we watch the same thing happen again in real-time: deglobalizationary policies, easy loans and credit that led to insidious market fraud, subsequent bursting of the credit bubble, active bank failures, and the clear onset of this subsequent world war.*', 'comments': ['Fantastic series!!', 'Wow!
