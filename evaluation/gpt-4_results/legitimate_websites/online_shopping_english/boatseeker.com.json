This provides some assurance that the website is at least taking basic steps to secure user information through encryption. However, the presence of a valid SSL certificate does not alone prove the site's legitimacy. Given that there is no clear evidence of scam characteristics, such as unusually low prices, claims of impossible amounts of money, targeting of psychological weaknesses, non-existent companies, inappropriate contact information, ambiguous privacy policies, uncommon payment methods, or outdated information (other than the use of \"EXPIRED\" in listings), I cannot conclusively determine that the site is a scam based on the available evidence. Based on the WHOIS information, the website has been around since 1997, which is generally a good sign for legitimacy. The lack of negative social media presence and having a valid SSL certificate also appear to support the legitimacy of the website.
