Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** \\n\\n> Whether you buy into Eggersâ insane epic, get high on its blood-drenched sorcery or roll your eyes at its excesses, the film makes you appreciate how seldom we get to see a big, noisy, brawling spectacle these days thatâs grounded not in comic-book superheroes and villains but in culturally specific history. In other words, a work of bold imagination, not another offshoot of a familiar IP. That alone deserves respect.\\n\\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-northman-alexander-skarsgard-nicole-kidman-robert-eggers-1235127058/)\\n\\n> Itâs not like this movie is a punishing chore; itâs not like Eggers doesnât want multiplex audiences to like it. And they will. Because this is the kind of filmmaking that rips you out of your body so hard that youâre liable to forget what year it is. In a movie era thatâs been defined by compromise, âThe Northmanâ rides into theaters with the fury of a valkyrie â itâs the rare studio epic that would sooner die than submit to modern precepts of how it should be told. While so many people in the industry are scrambling to change their fates, Eggers reminds us just how awesome it can feel to conquer them.\\n\\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/04/the-northman-review-1234715765/): A-\\n\\n> 'The Witch' director Robert Eggers has vision to burn, but robs this brutal 10th-century revenge story of the tragic twist it needs to hook us emotionally.\\n\\n-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/the-northman-review-1235229739/)\\n\\n> The Northman is a horribly violent, nihilistic and chaotic story about the endless cycle of violence, the choice between loving your friends and hating your enemies â which turns out to be no choice at all, and the thread of fate down which masculinityâs delicious toxin drips. Itâs entirely outrageous, with some epic visions of the flaring cosmos. I couldnât look away.\\n\\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/11/the-northman-review-robert-eggers-hamlet-outrageous-violence): 5/5\\n\\n> âThe Northmanâ is the best kind of multi-quadrant movie. Without abandoning his arthouse credentials, Eggers has made a rousingly rough, extreme action saga that has the potential of attracting the kind of viewers who might have found his previous work impenetrable. Itâs a vision of futility and fury, of a clash between nature and humanity where violence is both the means and the consequence, and an ancient revenge fantasy that speaks with terrible truth to this moment and to the historical lessons we never seem to learn.\\n\\n-[Alonso Duralde, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/the-northman-film-review-alexander-skarsgard-nicole-kidman-robert-eggers/)\\n\\n> Eggersâs films have all been set in eras and places where the divide between the natural and supernatural feels as thin as a wisp, but The Northman allows him to push his flair for folkloric images to a new extreme. He shows us a tree hung with the zombified corpses of long-dead ancestors, and a valkyrie riding her way to the heroâs paradise of ValhÇ«ll. The filmâs budget, partially due to pandemic delays, reached somewhere around $90m (Â£69m). Itâs a big risk to spend that much cash on an auteur-driven historical epic at a time when historical epics have largely fallen by the wayside. But what a beautiful risk it is. I call upon Odin: may The Northman make a billion dollars.\\n\\n-[Clarisse Loughrey, The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-northman-review-robert-eggers-b2055626.html): 5/5\\n\\n> This is intimate, culturally rich storytelling on a brutally epic scale. SkarsgÃ¥rd is in his element, bolstered by a sensational cast throwing themselves headfirst into Eggers and SjÃ³nâs awe-inspiring vision. A cinematic saga worthy of the ancestors.\\n\\n-[Hanna Flint, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-northman/): 5/5\\n\\n> A staggering feat of visceral filmmaking, âThe Northman,â like Eggersâ previous films, warrants profound analysis while still delivering a high-octane action odyssey. Some of the flourishes the director opted for, as well as the filmâs overall demeanor (neither entirely self-serious nor fully whimsical), may receive mixed reactions. Still what Eggers has ambitiously crafted lands as an invigorating beacon for an industry in need of studio fare with substantial ideas and artistry.\\n\\n-[Carlos Aguilar, The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/the-northman-review-robert-eggers-alexander-skarsgard-anya-taylor-joy-20220411/): A-\\n\\n> Compared to most US action adventures, The Northman is adventurous and distinctive. It feels compromised, but the great stuff outweighs the not-so-great stuff. To see or not to see? If that is the question, the answer is: see it.\\n\\n-[Nicholas Barber, BBC](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220411-the-northman-review-not-weird-or-violent-enough): 3/5\\n\\n> While this is Eggersâ least horror-centric story, he still utilizes many of the same techniques to engross the audience in the foreboding that this period must have induced in the people of that time. There are few filmmakers that can make the leap from smaller, insular stories into large-scale epics, but with The Northman, Eggers has proved that his style and substance can remain intact, regardless of the size of the story.\\n\\n-[Ross Bonaime, Collider](https://collider.com/the-northman-review-robert-eggers-anya-taylor-joy-alexander-skarsgard/): B+\\n\\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n**PLOT**\\n\\nPrince Amleth is on the verge of becoming a man when his father is brutally murdered by his uncle, who kidnaps the boy's mother.
