I love the MIPs technology and the versatile look of the Lin. They were both very adjustable and comfortable to wear.\\n\\nThe Kask was nice. Very comfortable and the head strap system feels great. Makes the fit and adjustments feel great and very secure to the head.\\n\\nBoth Giros are very nice and sleek. The Atmos has a nice look and good all around coverage to the head. The Air Attack is what my gf likes the most (she will be buying the helmet for my bday) and the color scheme on the shield version matches my bike almost exactly (because thats important... right?)\\n\\nMy top two are the Air Attack and Scott Lin. I am not a greatly fast rider and will be in the woods doing 8-12mph rides in mtb loops, so the Air attack may not be the best in terms of ventilation on those rides, but may actually still be more than my current hemlet. I really like the looks and the shape (I don\\'t like road helmet looks very much, but I don\\'t want a bmx helmet either). Seems like a nice all around helmet and I am sure I won\\'t \"outgrow\" it in the next 5 years.  \\nThe Lin is a more traditional style road helmet, but also has some off-road type features. Combined with the MIPs technology this helmet would be very nice. My only concern is cold and/or wet days. I figure for commuting I can throw on my current helmet, especially during the winter, but having a better helmet for my longer road rides would be very nice. [Both weigh](http://www.bikeradar.com/us/mtb/gear/category/protection/helmet-standard/product/review-scott-lin-helmet-13-47250/) about [the same](http://www.bikeradar.com/us/road/gear/category/helmets-and-protection/helmet-standard/product/review-giro-air-attack-helmet-13-47183/). (280 +/- 3 grams). The Lin is $80-$100 cheaper. The Giro looks better (to me) and can be grown into more the better I get (the better I get the more useful it is, i guess).\\n\\n**tl;dr: Helmets.
