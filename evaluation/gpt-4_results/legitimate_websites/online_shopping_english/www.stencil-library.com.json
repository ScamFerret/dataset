Follow either [@wickedplayer494](https://twitter.com/wickedplayer494) (suitable for those that want everything), or [@wp494news](https://twitter.com/wp494news) (suitable for those that want SMS notifications or a low-traffic account) for notifications on not only these updates, but more!\\n\\nIf you happen to be subscribed to the Pushbullet channels previously plugged: unfortunately, when Pushbullet did their big redesign, they screwed up the ability to push things to channels from the Chrome extension, so as it stands right now, you probably have had radio silence coming from them for the last little while. Sorry - go bother them to put sending to channels back into the Chrome extension.', 'comments': ['Player and weapon culling demonstration https://youtu.be/Jj3P9_Slr2w', 'Permanent $100 Zeus, complete animation/hitbox rework...  \\nHOLY SHIIIIIT', '>– Players can now report enemies for anti-competitive griefing (i.e. deliberately losing)\\n\\nRiP derankers!', '> Updated animation networking to continually synchronize animation state instead of periodically latching\\n\\nYOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS', '[deleted]']}]"
