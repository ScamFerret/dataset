There are sales with significant discounts (up to 80% off), which could be a red flag, but discounts alone are not enough to conclude it is a scam. The products listed are typical for an e-commerce site specializing in equine gear, and there's a physical address and phone number provided. However, the copyright date is set to 2024, which is odd and could indicate outdated information. Before making a conclusion, I should cross-check the website's reputation and gather more information about the company and its online presence.",
