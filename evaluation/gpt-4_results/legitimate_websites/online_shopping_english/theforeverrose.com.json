It has been immortalized for centuries in the art and literature of many cultures. It is, to the world, what Gold, Silver, and Platinum are to the realm of precious metals. These timeless symbols of richness and beauty have been perfectly combined to create our elegant Forever Rose STARTS WITH REAL ROSES The journey starts in our nursery, where our highly skilled horticulturalists and staff spare no expense. They carefully monitor each rose as it grows and begins to bloom. As it reaches its ideal moment of perfection and beauty, it is chosen and harvested. THE PROCESS Once we harvest the rose, the journey has only begun. With over 60 meticulous steps and ten days of hand work by skilled artisans and technicians, each Forever Rose is one-of-a-kind, unique and everlasting. We use a proprietary process known as electroforming to plate multiple layers onto the rose. This is done in many very light layers to maintain as much natural detail of the rose as possible. These steps are performed under strict quality control to assure the highest level of quality. THE RESULT With over twenty years of experience, our world-famous Forever Roses are second to none.
