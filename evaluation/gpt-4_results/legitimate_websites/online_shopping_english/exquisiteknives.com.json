Long before I dreamed of making knives, I collected and used about every knife I could get my hands on. Barlow folders, Buck Knives, Bayonets, you name it! Around 1987 while training in the Korean Martial Art of Hwa Rang Do I discovered the combat usage of an edged weapon. It intrigued me enough to venture out into the World of Custom Knives. The first pieces I owned were from Phil Hartsfield and Shiva Ki, both renowned combat knife specialists. Jesus Lechuga, now passed, was my martial arts instructor. Martin Kruse and Al Barton, both now passed, were my first bladesmithing coaches. Dave Has Been Collecting And Assisting Knife Collectors Obtain The Rarest And Most Beautiful Custom Knives In The World For Over 30 Years. I also spent time in Arkansas at the American Bladesmith Society School with Hanford Miller and Keith Kilby. In 1997 I became California’s first ABS Mastersmith. My primary focus was on large fixed blades with natural handles, forging my own Damascus and High Carbon Steels. I currently sell more Bob Loveless and Bill Moran Knives than anyone. I was honored to attend both Bob Loveless’ and Jim Merritt’s funerals. I always enjoyed chatting with Mr. Moran at the Blade Show as well as sharing my collection with him. I have great relationships with other makers like Michael Walker, Wolfe Loerchner, C. Gray Taylor and so many more. I am friendly with most of the top makers in Europe and always have fine examples of their work in my personal collection. Many of the pieces that I sell are from my collection or purchased from the many artists that I support. CAS, Sam Lurquin, Adam and Hailey DesRosiers are all friends and I sell a lot of their works. Most of the top custom knife dealers are close confidants. I appreciate you taking your time to view my site, I am honored! I do accept an occasional consignment but strictly on a limited basis.
