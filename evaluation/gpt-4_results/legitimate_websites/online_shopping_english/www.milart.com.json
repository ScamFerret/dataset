However, there's also a comment indicating that the owner was retiring rather than the company going under. This aligns with the website's announcement about closing permanently and not taking new orders, but fulfilling in-house orders and providing refunds where necessary. Given this information and the lack of any immediate red flags of a scam, it seems that the website may be in the process of legitimate closure rather than being a scam site.
