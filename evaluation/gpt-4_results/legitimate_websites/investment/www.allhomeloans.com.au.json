If it\\'s too long, you may skip ahead to the parts and sections that interest you most, but I recommend you to read the whole post if you can.\\n\\n**As a victim of identity theft and fraud myself in a very ugly case where the fraudsters impersonated me and got away by stealing £25,000 worth of Bounce Back Loan funds from a bank, I have overcame this situation for the most part and I felt inspired to share my most useful advice and guidance for helping victims of fraud on how to deal with this kind of situation and how to solve it.\\nI also wish to dedicate this post to my best friend Michael who has been of very huge help and support to me during this ordeal.**\\n\\nI have written (or at least attempted to write) the most complete guide on what to do if you\\'re a victim of identity theft and fraud, packed with detail and useful information, this is really thorough advice which I wished someone would have told me years ago, what I aim to do in this post is be as thorough as possible and provide as much detail as possible in how to deal with identity theft and fraud, with insights gained from my own experiences. \\n\\nIn this post I will be referring to UK procedures, organisations and legislations, which may be different from those in the United States of America or elsewhere, this is because I\\'m from the UK and I\\'ll refer to organisations and processes I dealt with, and even though this post will be very useful to victims of fraud from the UK, it is in truth very useful to anyone who\\'s been a victim of fraud anywhere in the world, regardless of the country. Because you will learn almost ALL that it is possible to do.\\n\\n**I must issue a standard disclaimer here that this is not intended as professional, legal or medical advice, you need to seek professional help from qualified and licensed organisations and practitioners, and in the case of health matters and mental health, you must seek professional help from qualified and licensed practitioners. You must also use the information expressed here in accordance with the laws of your country.**\\n\\nRight, so first of all, I will break the whole post apart into 3 stages :\\n\\n• **Stage 1. Immediate Response to Fraud -** Here is what you can do immediately to respond to fraud, by contacting the bank and other institutions, checking your credit reports, protecting your identity and freezing your reports, collecting evidence and consulting with witnesses (if you happen to have any), consulting with Citizens Advice Bureau, and reporting the case to the Police and to Action Fraud.\\n\\n• **Stage 2. Escalation -** Here is how you escalate when the matter is more complex, usually because there\\'s more aspects to the issue, for example maybe it is a business/company type of scam happening with your stolen identity and you need to report it to Companies House or elsewhere, or maybe other institutions need to be contacted i.e. Insolvency Service or HMRC, or maybe the bank is being unhelpful, accusatory and blaming you for the losses, in which case you can issue a Complaint with the bank defending your claim and aiming to resolve this matter as well as submitting a DSAR request to have access to what the bank noted about you, or maybe debt collectors are already sending you letters asking you to pay for losses that have been caused by fraudsters using your stolen identity. You may also have went through a difficult time and need to reach out for support, in which case i want you to be aware of and remind you of the fact that you can contact your GP for help, as well as seek therapy and Mental Health support (in case of emergencies please call 999 or the emergency phone line in your country of residence). You can also ask your GP to give you a Private Letter, attesting to the crisis you have went through, this can certainly be helpful and you can add it to your file. And you can also reach out to Debt Charities offering free debt advice and legal advice which may help. This section here is how you deal with these types of situations and access all of the resources available around you.\\n\\n• **Stage 3. Final Escalation Efforts/Resolution -** At this stage I present the final efforts you can take, in the case of a bank not resolving your complaint, you can escalate to the Financial Ombudsman and let them review the case independently and issue a final legal decision, which may resolve your situation favourably, or may not, in which case you will need to decide whether to declare bankruptcy, get debt advice and guidance, take your case to court or not (unless you REALLY have to, its best you don\\'t go to court, it is tough, a long process, potentially risky and unfair, and should be kept only as a last resort).\\n\\n● **1. Immediate Response to Fraud**\\n\\n• **1.1 - Contact the Banks.**\\nThis should be the first step, contact the banks and other institutions and let them know you\\'ve been a victim of fraud. Whether you had an application in your name for a bank account or a loan, or your credit/debit card was stolen or its information compromised, or anything else, the first thing you do is contact the respective institution to make them aware of this in order to let them know you did not do those actions, and to stop the fraudsters. If your bank card was compromised or stolen, try to freeze them via your mobile banking app, if that doesn\\'t work, then call up the bank on it\\'s fraud line (which should be open 24/7 sometimes). This can help stop the fraudsters plans in motion in most cases if done early enough.\\n\\n• **1.2 - Check your Credit Reports.**\\nThere are 3 major Credit Bureaus, namely Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. The UK has different websites for them specifically for the UK, which differ slightly from the American ones. Credit report data can be accessed freely on Experian, but for Equifax you\\'d need to use Clearscore if you want access to the Equifax report for free, and for TransUnion you\\'ll need to use CreditKarma to access the TransUnion report for free. You can still use Equifax and TransUnion themselves, but i believe they may charge a monthly fee. Checkmyfile is the best platform overall as you get access to the reports of all 3 Credit Bureaus at once, but it requires a monthly subscription fee.\\n\\nIn those reports you should look at all of the searches and entries that show up, particularly at Hard Searches. Also check for addresses, details, names, and companies you don\\'t recognise, if something doesn\\'t look right, you can dispute the search and get it removed from your report, but you must also contact the organisation in question to make it aware that the search is fraudulent and to enquire with it further.\\nIf nothing suspicious shows up, you\\'re clear, but if you\\'re not sure and your credit score displays a low number and you haven\\'t had a history of defaults or missed credit payments, please look at the report and check again, or contact the relevant Credit Agency for help. Personally it took me a long time to really learn and understand what my report means.\\n\\n- Link to Experian (UK version) here : https://www.experian.co.uk\\n- Link to Equifax (UK version) here :\\nhttps://www.equifax.co.uk\\n- Link to TransUnion (UK version) here :\\nhttps://www.transunion.co.uk\\n- Link to Clearscore here : https://www.clearscore.com\\n- Link to CreditKarma here :\\nhttps://www.creditkarma.co.uk\\n- Link to Checkmyfile here :\\nhttps://www.checkmyfile.com\\n\\n\\n• **1.3 - Freeze your Credit and Protect your Identity.**\\nIn the USA I have understood that you can freeze your credit reports, however in the UK this is not entirely possible. It is possible to freeze the Experian credit report by having a monthly subscription with them and using the CreditLock feature, which can be toggled on/off, however there\\'s no such feature for Equifax or TransUnion. \\n\\nSo in this case the best thing to do is contact all 3 Credit Bureaus : Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion to let them know that you want to set up a Notice of Correction Password with them. The Notice of Correction Password is a message that shows up on your report and is mandatorily read by any company that takes a look at your credit report, and it can be used as an aid to prevent fraudulent applications in your name getting through.\\nWith the Notice of Correction Password active, you will have to give or mention the password contained in it every time you apply for any form of credit. Do be aware however that it is possible that simply just for having the Notice of Correction Password on your report that a company can refuse your application.\\nIf you\\'re okay with paying a monthly membership fee, Checkmyfile makes this process easier because you can message customer service and request them to set up the Notice of Correction Password with all 3 Credit Bureaus, and they will do so on your behalf, making things easier for you.\\n\\nBelow I have listed an example of a Notice of Correction Password template which you can use to make up your own, filling it with your details and making any required modifications for your own situation :\\n\\n**\" I, Mr/Mrs ... , have reason to believe that my personal details are being used fraudulently in an attempt to obtain credit in my name. Therefore I ask any companies searching my credit report to ask for the password \"*Enter A Password Of Your Choice Here*\" in order to confirm my identity for any genuine application made by myself.\"**\\n\\nYou can also contact CIFAS and for a fee of £20 which you pay every 2 years you can get a CIFAS marker, which registers you as a victim of identity theft on the systems of the CIFAS members. The members of CIFAS includes 200 or more banks, lenders, and other major institutions. This will make the CIFAS members to perform additional identity checks, request additional proof of identity, or perhaps even refuse an application if they suspect it to be risky. However 200 companies is not that much, and you\\'d still be vulnerable to fraud attempts, so make sure you use all methods provided here.\\n- Link to CIFAS here : https://www.cifas.org.uk\\n\\nTo be as ironclad as possible against fraud, I recommend that you make full use of all 3 options presented here : Get the CreditLock feature on Experian and turn it on to lock your credit, add a Notice of Correction Password with all 3 Credit Bureaus: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, and purchase a CIFAS marker and registration. With these three layers of protection, while not impossible, it will be made extremely tough and not worthwhile for anyone to attempt to commit fraud in your name.\\nYou should still watch out for other ways in which fraudsters can try to cause harm that don\\'t involve credit applications ! Stay vigilant.\\n\\n• **1.4 - Collecting Evidence and Consulting with Witnesses.**\\nIf you are lucky enough to have evidence of the fraud that occured or that someone else is using your identity, then make sure you save that evidence. If you have messages, emails, transactions, photos of the suspect, or anything of use, collect it all in one place, save it on a Google Drive or Dropbox, and make sure you have copies of the evidence as it may become very useful later on, especially if the fraudsters get caught and the case gets to court. \\nIf you have witnesses who are aware of the situation that happened to you, family or friends, make sure you consult with them, as they can offer moral and emotional support. Communicate and stay in touch with them, they can also help your case later on as witnesses (again, if the case goes to court).\\n\\n• **1.5 - Citizens Advice Bureau.**\\nI have personally found the Citizens Advice Bureau service to be very helpful and useful, you just explain the situation to them and they point you to all of the right resources and institutions where you can get help, they can also offer some decent and basic legal advice, they\\'re quite helpful, especially if your case is a bit more complex or you don\\'t know what to do and who to turn to, reach out to them and you will know.\\n- Link to Citizens Advice Bureau here : https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/ \\n\\n• **1.6 - Reporting the case to Police and Action Fraud.**\\nIf you\\'re from the UK, you\\'re always told to report fraud to Action Fraud, so go ahead and do that and write down the Action Fraud crime reference number they\\'ll give you, it will be needed MANY times. Unfortunately Action Fraud typically don\\'t do a whole lot, they will give you advice and will make a record of what you tell them, but it\\'s rare that they will actually investigate cases unfortunately, still, reporting to Action Fraud is a must and many organisations will ask you for the Action Fraud reference number, so get it as it is an essential part of resolving such problems.\\n- Link to the Action Fraud website here : https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/\\n\\nI also recommend that you report fraud to the Metropolitan Police as well. It may get ignored, but it\\'s worth trying. If you\\'re in Scotland, the police can decide by themselves if they want to investigate or not (which means you must report to them first, and to Action Fraud second), but in England and other regions they most likely will ignore the report, saying that you need to go to Action Fraud. This has been my experience and that of many people, but if you report online you might get a MET Police Reference Number for your report which can be useful to add alongside your Action Fraud crime reference number. It will at the very least show that you tried to report the crime to the actual police forces and not just Action Fraud.\\n\\nFurthermore, the UK has an organisation called Crimestoppers where you can anonymously report criminals and fraudsters. You can make use of this service as well to report the criminals there as well, in addition to the Police and Action Fraud, slightly raising the chances for an investigation and prosecution of the offenders.\\n- Link to the Crimestoppers website here : \\nhttps://crimestoppers-uk.org\\n\\n\\n● **2. Escalation.**\\n\\n• **2.1 - The Fraud is of a Business/Company type.**\\nThis is what happened to me with the Bounce Back Loan that was fraudulently taken out in the name of a bogus company where the fraudsters put me as a director. If the fraud that happened to you is of a Business/Company type, where fraudsters impersonate you and pretend that you\\'re a business owner or a company director through a limited company, then you have far less legal liability than if you were to be a victim of a fraudulent personal loan taken out in your name.\\n\\nPrivate Limited Companies consist of company liability, and not personal liability, if something goes wrong, the company will be responsible as an entity itself, and the director/s would be liable in their capacity to act as directors, however they would not be personally liable.\\nThis is different, however, for Sole Traders, because they would be personally liable due to not being a company, but this is rare, usually a Private Limited Company is more common.\\n\\nWhat happened to a lot of UK citizens including myself is fraudsters took out Bounce Back Loans a few years ago during Covid-19, making up company names and using victims stolen identities to pretend to be legitimate. Thankfully the process is different and your liability is only in your capacity as a (false) director of that (fake) company, and you cannot be held personally liable. This means nothing can be taken away from you if it\\'s not an asset associated with the fraudulent business or company, which of course, there isn\\'t any, it doesn\\'t exist, meaning that nothing can be taken away from you. However, be aware that banks and debt collection agencies are still allowed to try, and that things are still not as clear-cut as that, situations can vary and exceptions can happen, so make sure you\\'re aware of this.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Bounce Back Loans (BBLs) are backed up by the Government, meaning that the Bank will be able to apply to the Government to refund it in full. The process can vary, but usually the bank has to keep making attempts and use legal action in the form of sending Debt Collection agencies after you to get the debt paid, it will do this for either a year more, or up to a few years. Eventually, though, once it exhausts this process and it is confident that it won\\'t get its money back, the bank will likely apply to the Government for the refund and the case will then be closed.\\n\\n**Below, sections 2.2 Companies House, 2.3 Insolvency Service will be especially relevant to the case of Business/Company type impersonation fraud, but will still be useful to anyone.**\\n\\n• **2.2 - Companies House.**\\n**Note** : Around Spring of 2024 Companies House will be granted new legal powers which will enable it to assess the legitimacy of directors, making additional identity checks, as well as to remove fraudulent or false information from directors and companies, including in the cases of identity theft. This will make Companies House an essential organisation to contact if you were victim to a Business/Company type of impersonation fraud, especially of a Bounce Back Loan style. As such, I recommend that at that point you contact Companies House directly regarding this matter !\\n\\nTo find out if a fraudulent company was opened up in your name, you can search up your name on Companies House (or on Google, next to \"Companies House\") and discover what fraudulent companies you\\'ve been associated with and listed as a director on. Check for names, dates, addresses (fraudsters will usually use a fake address, but sometimes can and do use one of your real former or even current addresses), dates of birth, nationality, and other information.\\nYou should also look at the public Filing History of the company, which can give you additional information on what documents were submitted.\\nYou should also check to see if you can find other \"directors\" in that bogus company, know that they can either be the fraudsters themselves, or the fraudsters using another person\\'s stolen identity, note down everything you can about those individuals. \\nCheck to see what other companies you have been associated with as well, if there\\'s more than one.\\n\\nYou can then contact Companies House by email to dispute the company and your information showing up there, you can also submit certain forms which can help take down fraudulent information such as your director\\'s appointment which you did not consent to, make additional rectification (very useful in cases where there are additional forged and false documents in your name, such as documents with someone impersonating you with a false signature, etc), as well as remove one of your home addresses associated with the bogus company. *Companies House has a useful article here* : https://www.gov.uk/guidance/report-a-company-using-your-personal-details-without-your-permission \\n\\n**Below follows 3 very important and useful applications you can make if your information and stolen identity was used without your consent** :\\n- **1. Apply to Remove Material About a Director (RP06) -** This form is the most important when you\\'ve been a victim of identity theft and appointed as a fake director without your consent. When you submit this form, you report the company and Companies House will contact the company to send proof that you consented to act as a director, fraudsters don\\'t have any such proof, or at least don\\'t bother forging and sending any, so your information will be removed and you will receive a letter confirming that the company did not give evidence that you consented to be a director. Keep this letter safe, it will be extremely important, and is very useful in all future disputes you may have.\\n- Link to RP06 form here - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-to-remove-material-about-a-director-rp06 \\n\\n- **2. Apply for Rectification by the Registrar of Companies (RP02A) -** This form is useful when additional false and forged documents were submitted in your name. You can check for such documents in the Filing History of the company or by communicating with Companies House and asking them to check if there are any and if you should send them an RP02A form, but with this document you can remove such forged documents. The Registrar will also check to see if they are forged and false, and if they are, they will define this clearly under the reason for rectification in the letter that you will receive as confirmation. Keep this letter safe when you receive it, it is proof in your favour.\\n- Link to RP02A form here - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-rectification-by-the-registrar-of-companies-rp02a\\n\\n- **3. Apply to Change a Company\\'s Disputed Registered Office Address (RP07) -** This form is useful when the fraudsters used one of your own former home addresses or even an actual home address in the bogus company, thus exposing publicly where you live and putting you at even greater risk of being a victim of even more crime. You can submit this form along with supporting evidence and remove your home address from the fake company.\\n- Link to RP07 form here - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-to-change-a-companys-disputed-registered-office-address-rp07\\n\\n• **2.3 - Insolvency Service and HMRC.**\\nYou resort to the Insolvency Service when the Police and Action Fraud do not make progress in your case and want to try your best shot at getting the case investigated. The Insolvency Service works closely with the Police and can prosecute fraudsters.\\nIn certain cases, you may have to go further, the Insolvency Service can investigate fraudulent companies and misconduct or illegalities done by directors or company owners. They can look into both fraud as well as scam schemes. \\nYou can report to the Insolvency Service if you\\'ve been the victim of an impersonation fraud of a Business/Company style, or when reporting the fraudsters themselves and their own companies, if they have such companies and you happen to discover them.\\n- Link to Insolvency Service here for reporting fraudulent companies here - https://www.gov.uk/complain-company\\n\\nYou can report to HMRC when you\\'ve been a victim of identity theft and fraud on a more personal level, when fraudsters use your compromised identity to pretend that you\\'re working for a bogus company and are earning a lot more money than you actually are and paid more than you should and should then get tax refunds, they would try to change your tax code and alter your employment, leaving you with a lot of money to pay in taxes to HMRC.\\nFraudsters would also try to change your home address and correspondence address and this is VERY dangerous because they can then request to receive by post various documents in your name and find out your National Insurance number, to prevent this, actively check your HMRC account every now and then for the information on it. HMRC can also take legal action against the criminals and can prosecute them, which can work if you aren\\'t making much progress with Police or Action Fraud.\\n\\nTo report any of these, or any other type of fraud with your stolen identity to HMRC, you will have to find the relevant department for your query, you can check the link below for a list of relevant departments which you can contact. Depending on your situation, Income Tax, National Insurance, or other departments might be more relevant, make sure you contact any HMRC department and confirm which one is right for your issue :\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/contact-hmrc\\n\\n**Usually, the phone lines for HMRC are very busy on a daily basis and calls are impossible to make, so try instead to use Ask HMRC Online with the relevant departments, it is a form of webchat, this way you can reach out to them and communicate via text with an HMRC agent.**\\n- Link to contact HMRC here -  https://www.gov.uk/contact-hmrc\\n\\n• **2.4 - The Bank is being unhelpful, accusatory and is blaming you.**\\n\\nSometimes, and by sometimes I mean VERY RARELY, banks are helpful and are compassionate, understanding, and fair to victims of fraud and resolve their complaints, yes, so rarely that it is almost unheard of. However, from what I observed in the situations of others as well as from my own experience, the banks resort to blaming the victims of fraud and trying anything they can to hold the victims liable, which is something I want to address here.\\n\\nIf youre a victim of fraud, and the fraud has already been done and the bank is evil and careless, they may try to blame you, accuse you, call you a liar, call you a criminal and whatnot, and attempt to hold you liable by force. They may even try to tell you to give them every proof you have that you\\'ve been a victim of fraud only for them to then spin it in a way in which they can blame you, at least partially. You can use your own judgement here, but I will say that if in doubt, you may need to get legal advice from a lawyer or solicitor for what to say. But know that if the bank is hostile, then it is likely to use everything you give it and flip it against you to make you look bad, for example if you gave your compromised identity document online to a cyberscammer and you tell this to the bank, the bank may then blame you for \"willingly\" giving your identity document away to a criminal. Be careful. You do not have to comply with the bank\\'s demands either, and you don\\'t have to give them any more details other than what is essential and relevant. Know that the bank doesn\\'t care and is willing to get it\\'s money back from anywhere and anyone, even from victims of fraud. This is extremely scummy, and most victims of fraud know this, it\\'s a very dark reality of the banks unseen by most people, and this is why we suffer so much, but it\\'s sadly the way banks operate, don\\'t worry though, there are solutions. In the case where you lost your money to fraud and the bank didn\\'t lose it\\'s own money, it is likely to try everything it can to avoid refunding the losses into your bank account.\\n\\nAs such, know that it is wise to avoid entering pointless discourses and do not waste time, instead just show them the Action Fraud/Police crime reference number, reiterate that you\\'ve been a victim of a crime, and if they will accept it and close the case with you as a victim of fraud and solve the matter, then good, if not, you need to escalate by raising a Complaint, you will then get a Complaint reference number. \\n\\nYou can tell Customer Service that you want to make a Complaint, or you can look online on how to raise one with the bank, you will then be assigned a Complaint reference number, write this reference number down - it will be necessary later. You will then have a chance to describe the situation, the issue, what the bank has done wrong, and a Complaints Manager will look into the situation for you. That is when you should give the bank proof that you\\'ve been a victim of identity theft and fraud. In most cases, and with most banks, the Complaints Manager won\\'t be able to uphold the complaint AKA won\\'t resolve the complaint in your favour, this is because a bank rarely wants to admit it\\'s own mistakes and faults, and it\\'s interest will remain to get back the money it lost or to avoid refunding you the money that you lost, but at the very least, opening a Complaint will give you a chance to resolve the matter internally with the bank, as well as give you some time and space to breathe, it typically takes a few weeks to a month or more for a Complaint to be investigated, time during which you can figure out what to do next or at least get a little bit of peace. During an ongoing Complaint procedure, Debt Collectors and their debt collection activities can be put on hold too if you present them with the Complaint reference number.\\n\\n**If the bank does not uphold your Complaint, then your next step will be to complain to the Financial Ombudsman (explained below at 3. Final Escalation Efforts/Resolution).**\\n\\nApart from filing a Complaint, you should also make a DSAR request (DSAR = Data Subject Access Request), which is free and anyone can make, in order to see exactly what fraudulent information with your stolen identity exists on that bank\\'s system i.e. fraudulent applications, details, etc. You can find a section to apply for a DSAR on your bank\\'s website.\\nYou\\'ll be able to see what the bank says about you, what the bank\\'s agents and employees noted about you on their systems, and then you\\'ll have a far better picture of what happened and what is the stance of the bank, as well as documents which you may find to be helpful for your case, especially if the case would go to court. It gives you inside information into the data that the bank holds about you.\\n\\n**When you know inside information from the bank\\'s records, you can check for fraudulent details impersonating you, such as fraudulent applications you did not make, names that don\\'t match yours, email addresses that are not yours, phone numbers, addresses, I.P. addresses, bank accounts, timestamps, geolocation data, forged and false documents, false signatures, and other information which is not yours and you don\\'t recognise, but is instead pretending to be you.\\nWhen you know this information (which you are entitled to having access to), you can better dispute with the bank, and prove your innocence. This will be especially important to know if you will go to the Financial Ombudsman or if you will ever have to go to Court. This is why a DSAR request is important.**\\n\\nAlternatively, or when dealing with other banks and firms that may not have a DSAR procedure displayed on their website, you can either contact them directly and request a DSAR, or you can contact the Information Commissioner\\'s Office (also known as the ICO) and receive a DSAR through them, link is below.\\n- Link to Information Commissioner\\'s Office is here : https://ico.org.uk\\n\\n• **2.5 - Debt Collectors are sending letters, trying to get you to pay.**\\nDebt Collection agencies can be employed by banks and firms in order to harass you until you pay, these agencies don\\'t really care if you\\'ve been a victim of fraud and had your identity stolen, they\\'re hired mercenaries and will do whatever they\\'re legally able to do to get paid.\\n\\nIn most cases for many of us, our first instance of finding out that we\\'ve been victims of fraud happens when we start receiving letters from one such Debt Collection agency. \\n\\nIn the UK, Debt Collection agencies are not bailiffs, and there are limits to what they can do. They can send letters, write emails, text your phone or call your phone, and they can try to get into your home if your door or window are open or unlocked, or if you let them in, and then they can make an inventory of objects they can seize, take away with them and sell to cover the debt, but they cannot force their way into your property and cannot break down the door, and if you refuse to let them in, they will leave eventually, they will keep trying, but will leave. They may return for a few more times, in which case you can just keep everything closed and locked and avoid communicating with them until they leave.\\nBailiffs on the other hand can be used by HMRC, or by the Courts following legal settlements.\\n\\nWhen being visited by Debt Collectors, make sure your car is parked somewhere far away from your property so they do not seize it, also make sure your doors and windows are locked, and that your valuables and other items are kept safe. Again, don\\'t let them enter, they can be tricky and relentless and try to convince you to let them in, they can either make threats, or try to sweet-talk you and pretend to want to help you, don\\'t fall for it. Keep everything locked, avoid discourse, and wait until they leave.\\n\\nYou must understand that if you\\'ve been a victim of fraud, you should not pay after some criminals, know your rights! It may be a very tough and challenging process, and Debt Collection agencies can be extremely persistent, but it is possible to win out in the end if you stand your ground.\\n\\nThe first thing you must do if you get contacted by a Debt Collection agency, or when you receive a letter from them for a debt you don\\'t recognise, is to contact them directly, letting them know your identity was stolen and you\\'ve been a victim of fraud, they will then ask you for your Action Fraud crime reference number, which you must then give, and may ask for more details of the situation.\\n\\nAfterwards they will decide whether to pursue or to desist, if they decide to pursue, then avoid communication with them when possible, but when not, then keep standing your ground and resist falling prey to their schemes. In most cases you can put them on hold by raising a Complaint with the bank or creditor that was scammed and informing the Debt Collection agency of this Complaint reference number, and the harassment will be put on hold. This will at least keep them at bay for a while, giving you some peace. \\n\\nThe Debt Collection agency can also be put on hold when you bring your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman and provide them with the FOS case reference number. Financial Ombudsman cases at the current time of writing in February 2024 typically take a long time to resolve (6 months or longer), which can give you a longer break from having to deal with the Debt Collection agencies.\\n\\nAlso, Debt Collection agencies can\\'t hold you personally liable if you\\'ve been a victim of a company style fraud where the liability is on the company and not on you, such as in the case of a fraudulent Bounce Back Loan. However once again, they are still legally allowed to TRY to get money from you.\\n\\nIn my own case, I stood my ground and the debt collection agency that was after me decided to give up, recognising that this is a genuine and sensible case of stolen identity where they believe the best thing to do is to cease all recovery action and return the responsibility of the matter back to the bank. I was very lucky, and I had to persist a lot to the point where I was brought to tears trying to explain to them that this is not right, but this shows that it is possible to win out in the end by standing your ground. However it may not be easy, it can be a very rocky road. You need to stand strong and keep going.\\n\\n**More advice and help with debt, debt collection agencies, and what to do in situations of stolen identity and fraud can be acquired through the companies and charities listed below, which i HIGHLY recommend** : \\n\\n- 1.

In this case, I want to remind you of the importance of contacting your GP or your Medical Practitioner and requesting help from them. They can assess you, can give you a diagnosis, can offer advice for your situation, and can refer you to undergo therapy and receive Mental Health support, and may even prescribe you medication if they think it is right to do so. \\nYou will also be able to request from them printed copies of the doctor\\'s notes and diagnostics, and can speak to them to request a Private Letter to attest to the crisis you experienced. This will be very helpful to add to your file. Know that it may cost a fee (it may cost £40 if I\\'m not mistaken). Also, notes from your therapist from your mental health sessions will also be very useful and helpful to have in your file.\\n\\nTherapy is extremely helpful and speaking from my own experience, it helped me to deal with the stress, depression and crisis surrounding my own case, it helps bring release and it also helps to untangle complex emotions and ways of thinking, making you understand yourself better and knowing how to change and change unhelpful patterns and begin to feel better.\\n\\nYou will find more information by contacting your GP/Medical Practitioner, which is what I advise you to do, unless it\\'s an emergency in which case please call 999 and seek urgent help now (or the emergency phone number in your country).\\n\\n**You may find additional useful information in the links below** : \\n- 1.

Final Escalation Efforts/Resolution.**\\n\\n• **3.1 - Resorting to the Financial Ombudsman.**\\nIn the UK, when you\\'ve raised a Complaint with the Bank or firm, and the complaint was not resolved or upheld in your favour, your next course of action is to bring your complaint about the business to the Financial Ombudsman. You can choose whether you want to go to the Financial Ombudsman, or get legal advice and consider declaring bankruptcy (which COULD work, but I don\\'t quite recommend, also, you need to get legal support and advice for this), or wait and see what the bank intends to do next (which can be very bad to do), or you can take legal action yourself and go to court (very dangerous, and very expensive, its advisable that you do not do this unless absolutely necessary). Usually what some people do is wait a while and think, before then deciding to go to the Financial Ombudsman as their next course of action.\\n\\n**The Investigator and Ombudsman are usually very helpful, and they can be far more understanding of the situation and your perspective than the bank will ever be. When first raising the complaint with them, you must of course define the resolution you seek (which I listed examples of above, for example to write off the fraudulent loan, to undo damage to the credit score, to cease debt collection activity, etc). If you\\'re currently getting chased by Debt Collectors, you can also give them the Financial Ombudsman reference number and put them on hold.**\\n**The Investigator aims to see exactly what the bank has done wrong, so you need to show them proof of wrongdoing, you must also show them any supporting documentation and evidence that you have, including of damage that the situation and the bank\\'s mistakes may have caused. In most cases, the Investigator alone will be enough to resolve your complaint, but in some cases you may find that you need the Ombudsman to review the complaint, be careful here, the Investigator could uphold your Complaint where the Ombudsman would not, and the Ombudsman\\'s decision is final and irreversible.**\\n\\n- Link to the Financial Ombudsman Service website is here : https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\\n\\n- Link to the Financial Conduct Authority Principles is here : https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/PRIN/2/1.html', 'comments': [\"Also, my original post was going to be a lot longer, I had to ommit a few parts of my post in order to be able to post it due to word count limits, I wish to add below the parts I ommited : \\n\\n**3.1 - Additional Financial Ombudsman Information**\\n\\nThe Financial Ombudsman is a free service set up by Parliament to mediate and resolve disputes between individuals and businesses. It is independent, impartial, fair, and objective, and acts as an alternative to the courts and has the legal powers to put things right. If the Financial Ombudsman upholds your complaint and you accept their decision, then it will be legally binding on the business whether the business agrees with the decision or not, they will have to do what has been decided they should do to make things right. The Financial Ombudsman can help with cases of frauds and scams, including those of ID theft. Some of the things that the service can achieve if your complaint is upheld is to make the business in question write off a fraudulent loan, to stop debt collection activity, to remove hard searches and undo the damage caused to your credit score/credit report, and to make the firm pay you a compensation fee for the damage that has been caused to you and which you suffered. \\n\\nI have found this service to be extremely helpful and useful, but can be lengthy. In my case it took me a full 6 months for my situation to be resolved. It takes a long amount of time for the Investigator/Adjudicator to get in touch and make their Provisional Decision, roughly 2 or 3 months, and then if you decide you disagree with their decision and want the case to be reviewed judicially by an Ombudsman, you may have to wait another 3 or 4 months, or longer. \\n\\n**Also, the Financial Ombudsman service takes into account the Financial Conduct Authority Principles when forming their decisions. If you have a quick read over those principles, you will be better able to explain the principles that the bank has breached and broken in your case, and you can better show what the bank has done wrong in this case. I have added at the bottom of this section a link to the FCA Principles Handbook.**\\n\\nIn my case, my complaint was not technically upheld due to the technicalities surrounding the situation, however it was favourable towards me as the bank was told it cannot hold me personally liable, and it also must apply to the Government to refund the fraudulent Bounce Back Loan after exhausting it's recovery methods, which again, cannot hold me personally liable. Therefore it was favourable, whilst still allowing the bank to try.\\n\\n- Link to the Financial Ombudsman Service website is here : https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\\n\\n- Link to the Financial Conduct Authority Principles is here : https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/PRIN/2/1.html\\n\\n• **3.2 Final Thoughts.**\\nFinally, I'd like to just say that declaring bankruptcy is another possible course of action, but it is tricky and can be dangerous, you may lose assets or you may not, so do not take it lightly, instead try to inform yourself as much as you can and seek legal advice for your situation.\\n\\nGetting debt advice and guidance from debt charities and helplines can also be useful, though they can only do so much, they may advise you to agree to a consolidation plan, or to only pay very small increments of the debt on a monthly basis, but whatever they advise you to do, it is your decision what to actually do, and in the cases of stolen identity and fraud, giving in and paying for a criminal should not be seen as an option.\\n\\nAlso, taking the bank to court can have dire consequences so I do not recommend anyone to do that unless as an absolute last resort. The bank has a lot of money and, chances are, it can pay a more experienced solicitor or lawyer. If you lost your own money to a scam, and it's a huge amount of money which the bank refuses to refund you, and you exhausted other avenues such as the FOS service, and you know you're in the right and can back it up, but you didn't get the result you want and you know its within reach, then you may go this route. However if the fraudsters impersonated you and defrauded the bank and the bank lost it's own money, then it's not your responsibility to go to court, the bank is also unlikely to go to court, this is a criminal case and as such it must be dealt with by the police, the bank is unlikely to take you to court, and if it does, you can then defend yourself. \\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nI hope all of this information helps with debt, as well as the victims of identity theft and fraud of this Reddit community, as well as victims of identity theft and fraud and people in debt in general.

A lot of thought and effort has gone into writing it. \\n\\nI really hope you’re in a good place now, physically, mentally and financially. \\n\\nHaving experienced what you have, and having worked with multiple agencies and organisations to resolve your situation, do you think there was anything you could have done differently to prevent or to minimise the likelihood of the fraud happening in the first few place?', \"Just on your point about reporting to the Met, that should only be done if there is evidence that the offence was committed within the Metropolitan Police area (i.e. Greater London). Otherwise you should report to Action Fraud.\\n\\nAction Fraud doesn't investigate fraud. What they do is pass the information on to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau who will then assess it. They will then decide whether it needs further investigation and which police force should carry the investigation.\\n\\nThe reason for this is because fraud is a national (and quite often international) offence. A fraudster could defraud victims in Manchester, London, Birmingham, and Leeds, all from their home down in Dorset. The aim of Action Fraud and the NFIB is to try and make sure all those offences are linked up and dealt with by one police force. That is why all fraud is reported centrally.\", \"Thanks OP!

You must also use the information expressed here in accordance with the laws of your country.**\\n\\nRight, so first of all, I will break the whole post apart into 3 stages :\\n\\n• **Stage 1. Immediate Response to Fraud -** Here is what you can do immediately to respond to fraud, by contacting the bank and other institutions, checking your credit reports, protecting your identity and freezing your reports, collecting evidence and consulting with witnesses (if you happen to have any), consulting with Citizens Advice Bureau, and reporting the case to the Police and to Action Fraud.\\n\\n• **Stage 2. Escalation -** Here is how you escalate when the matter is more complex, usually because there\\'s more aspects to the issue, for example maybe it is a business/company type of scam happening with your stolen identity and you need to report it to Companies House or elsewhere, or maybe other institutions need to be contacted i.e. Insolvency Service or HMRC, or maybe the bank is being unhelpful, accusatory and blaming you for the losses, in which case you can issue a Complaint with the bank defending your claim and aiming to resolve this matter as well as submitting a DSAR request to have access to what the bank noted about you, or maybe debt collectors are already sending you letters asking you to pay for losses that have been caused by fraudsters using your stolen identity. You may also have went through a difficult time and need to reach out for support, in which case i want you to be aware of and remind you of the fact that you can contact your GP for help, as well as seek therapy and Mental Health support (in case of emergencies please call 999 or the emergency phone line in your country of residence). You can also ask your GP to give you a Private Letter, attesting to the crisis you have went through, this can certainly be helpful and you can add it to your file. And you can also reach out to Debt Charities offering free debt advice and legal advice which may help. This section here is how you deal with these types of situations and access all of the resources available around you.\\n\\n• **Stage 3. Final Escalation Efforts/Resolution -** At this stage I present the final efforts you can take, in the case of a bank not resolving your complaint, you can escalate to the Financial Ombudsman and let them review the case independently and issue a final legal decision, which may resolve your situation favourably, or may not, in which case you will need to decide whether to declare bankruptcy, get debt advice and guidance, take your case to court or not (unless you REALLY have to, its best you don\\'t go to court, it is tough, a long process, potentially risky and unfair, and should be kept only as a last resort).\\n\\n● **1. Immediate Response to Fraud**\\n\\n• **1.1 - Contact the Banks.**\\nThis should be the first step, contact the banks and other institutions and let them know you\\'ve been a victim of fraud. Whether you had an application in your name for a bank account or a loan, or your credit/debit card was stolen or its information compromised, or anything else, the first thing you do is contact the respective institution to make them aware of this in order to let them know you did not do those actions, and to stop the fraudsters. If your bank card was compromised or stolen, try to freeze them via your mobile banking app, if that doesn\\'t work, then call up the bank on it\\'s fraud line (which should be open 24/7 sometimes). This can help stop the fraudsters plans in motion in most cases if done early enough.\\n\\n• **1.2 - Check your Credit Reports.**\\nThere are 3 major Credit Bureaus, namely Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. The UK has different websites for them specifically for the UK, which differ slightly from the American ones. Credit report data can be accessed freely on Experian, but for Equifax you\\'d need to use Clearscore if you want access to the Equifax report for free, and for TransUnion you\\'ll need to use CreditKarma to access the TransUnion report for free. You can still use Equifax and TransUnion themselves, but i believe they may charge a monthly fee. Checkmyfile is the best platform overall as you get access to the reports of all 3 Credit Bureaus at once, but it requires a monthly subscription fee.\\n\\nIn those reports you should look at all of the searches and entries that show up, particularly at Hard Searches. Also check for addresses, details, names, and companies you don\\'t recognise, if something doesn\\'t look right, you can dispute the search and get it removed from your report, but you must also contact the organisation in question to make it aware that the search is fraudulent and to enquire with it further.\\nIf nothing suspicious shows up, you\\'re clear, but if you\\'re not sure and your credit score displays a low number and you haven\\'t had a history of defaults or missed credit payments, please look at the report and check again, or contact the relevant Credit Agency for help. Personally it took me a long time to really learn and understand what my report means.\\n\\n- Link to Experian (UK version) here : https://www.experian.co.uk\\n- Link to Equifax (UK version) here :\\nhttps://www.equifax.co.uk\\n- Link to TransUnion (UK version) here :\\nhttps://www.transunion.co.uk\\n- Link to Clearscore here : https://www.clearscore.com\\n- Link to CreditKarma here :\\nhttps://www.creditkarma.co.uk\\n- Link to Checkmyfile here :\\nhttps://www.checkmyfile.com\\n\\n\\n• **1.3 - Freeze your Credit and Protect your Identity.**\\nIn the USA I have understood that you can freeze your credit reports, however in the UK this is not entirely possible. It is possible to freeze the Experian credit report by having a monthly subscription with them and using the CreditLock feature, which can be toggled on/off, however there\\'s no such feature for Equifax or TransUnion. \\n\\nSo in this case the best thing to do is contact all 3 Credit Bureaus : Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion to let them know that you want to set up a Notice of Correction Password with them. The Notice of Correction Password is a message that shows up on your report and is mandatorily read by any company that takes a look at your credit report, and it can be used as an aid to prevent fraudulent applications in your name getting through.\\nWith the Notice of Correction Password active, you will have to give or mention the password contained in it every time you apply for any form of credit. Do be aware however that it is possible that simply just for having the Notice of Correction Password on your report that a company can refuse your application.\\nIf you\\'re okay with paying a monthly membership fee, Checkmyfile makes this process easier because you can message customer service and request them to set up the Notice of Correction Password with all 3 Credit Bureaus, and they will do so on your behalf, making things easier for you.\\n\\nBelow I have listed an example of a Notice of Correction Password template which you can use to make up your own, filling it with your details and making any required modifications for your own situation :\\n\\n**\" I, Mr/Mrs ... , have reason to believe that my personal details are being used fraudulently in an attempt to obtain credit in my name. Therefore I ask any companies searching my credit report to ask for the password \"*Enter A Password Of Your Choice Here*\" in order to confirm my identity for any genuine application made by myself.\"**\\n\\nYou can also contact CIFAS and for a fee of £20 which you pay every 2 years you can get a CIFAS marker, which registers you as a victim of identity theft on the systems of the CIFAS members. The members of CIFAS includes 200 or more banks, lenders, and other major institutions. This will make the CIFAS members to perform additional identity checks, request additional proof of identity, or perhaps even refuse an application if they suspect it to be risky. However 200 companies is not that much, and you\\'d still be vulnerable to fraud attempts, so make sure you use all methods provided here.\\n- Link to CIFAS here : https://www.cifas.org.uk\\n\\nTo be as ironclad as possible against fraud, I recommend that you make full use of all 3 options presented here : Get the CreditLock feature on Experian and turn it on to lock your credit, add a Notice of Correction Password with all 3 Credit Bureaus: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, and purchase a CIFAS marker and registration. With these three layers of protection, while not impossible, it will be made extremely tough and not worthwhile for anyone to attempt to commit fraud in your name.\\nYou should still watch out for other ways in which fraudsters can try to cause harm that don\\'t involve credit applications ! Stay vigilant.\\n\\n• **1.4 - Collecting Evidence and Consulting with Witnesses.**\\nIf you are lucky enough to have evidence of the fraud that occured or that someone else is using your identity, then make sure you save that evidence. If you have messages, emails, transactions, photos of the suspect, or anything of use, collect it all in one place, save it on a Google Drive or Dropbox, and make sure you have copies of the evidence as it may become very useful later on, especially if the fraudsters get caught and the case gets to court. \\nIf you have witnesses who are aware of the situation that happened to you, family or friends, make sure you consult with them, as they can offer moral and emotional support. Communicate and stay in touch with them, they can also help your case later on as witnesses (again, if the case goes to court).\\n\\n• **1.5 - Citizens Advice Bureau.**\\nI have personally found the Citizens Advice Bureau service to be very helpful and useful, you just explain the situation to them and they point you to all of the right resources and institutions where you can get help, they can also offer some decent and basic legal advice, they\\'re quite helpful, especially if your case is a bit more complex or you don\\'t know what to do and who to turn to, reach out to them and you will know.\\n- Link to Citizens Advice Bureau here : https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/ \\n\\n• **1.6 - Reporting the case to Police and Action Fraud.**\\nIf you\\'re from the UK, you\\'re always told to report fraud to Action Fraud, so go ahead and do that and write down the Action Fraud crime reference number they\\'ll give you, it will be needed MANY times. Unfortunately Action Fraud typically don\\'t do a whole lot, they will give you advice and will make a record of what you tell them, but it\\'s rare that they will actually investigate cases unfortunately, still, reporting to Action Fraud is a must and many organisations will ask you for the Action Fraud reference number, so get it as it is an essential part of resolving such problems.\\n- Link to the Action Fraud website here : https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/\\n\\nI also recommend that you report fraud to the Metropolitan Police as well. It may get ignored, but it\\'s worth trying. If you\\'re in Scotland, the police can decide by themselves if they want to investigate or not (which means you must report to them first, and to Action Fraud second), but in England and other regions they most likely will ignore the report, saying that you need to go to Action Fraud. This has been my experience and that of many people, but if you report online you might get a MET Police Reference Number for your report which can be useful to add alongside your Action Fraud crime reference number. It will at the very least show that you tried to report the crime to the actual police forces and not just Action Fraud.\\n\\nFurthermore, the UK has an organisation called Crimestoppers where you can anonymously report criminals and fraudsters. You can make use of this service as well to report the criminals there as well, in addition to the Police and Action Fraud, slightly raising the chances for an investigation and prosecution of the offenders.\\n- Link to the Crimestoppers website here : \\nhttps://crimestoppers-uk.org\\n\\n\\n● **2. Escalation.**\\n\\n• **2.1 - The Fraud is of a Business/Company type.**\\nThis is what happened to me with the Bounce Back Loan that was fraudulently taken out in the name of a bogus company where the fraudsters put me as a director. If the fraud that happened to you is of a Business/Company type, where fraudsters impersonate you and pretend that you\\'re a business owner or a company director through a limited company, then you have far less legal liability than if you were to be a victim of a fraudulent personal loan taken out in your name.\\n\\nPrivate Limited Companies consist of company liability, and not personal liability, if something goes wrong, the company will be responsible as an entity itself, and the director/s would be liable in their capacity to act as directors, however they would not be personally liable.\\nThis is different, however, for Sole Traders, because they would be personally liable due to not being a company, but this is rare, usually a Private Limited Company is more common.\\n\\nWhat happened to a lot of UK citizens including myself is fraudsters took out Bounce Back Loans a few years ago during Covid-19, making up company names and using victims stolen identities to pretend to be legitimate. Thankfully the process is different and your liability is only in your capacity as a (false) director of that (fake) company, and you cannot be held personally liable. This means nothing can be taken away from you if it\\'s not an asset associated with the fraudulent business or company, which of course, there isn\\'t any, it doesn\\'t exist, meaning that nothing can be taken away from you. However, be aware that banks and debt collection agencies are still allowed to try, and that things are still not as clear-cut as that, situations can vary and exceptions can happen, so make sure you\\'re aware of this.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Bounce Back Loans (BBLs) are backed up by the Government, meaning that the Bank will be able to apply to the Government to refund it in full. The process can vary, but usually the bank has to keep making attempts and use legal action in the form of sending Debt Collection agencies after you to get the debt paid, it will do this for either a year more, or up to a few years. Eventually, though, once it exhausts this process and it is confident that it won\\'t get its money back, the bank will likely apply to the Government for the refund and the case will then be closed.\\n\\n**Below, sections 2.2 Companies House, 2.3 Insolvency Service will be especially relevant to the case of Business/Company type impersonation fraud, but will still be useful to anyone.**\\n\\n• **2.2 - Companies House.**\\n**Note** : Around Spring of 2024 Companies House will be granted new legal powers which will enable it to assess the legitimacy of directors, making additional identity checks, as well as to remove fraudulent or false information from directors and companies, including in the cases of identity theft. This will make Companies House an essential organisation to contact if you were victim to a Business/Company type of impersonation fraud, especially of a Bounce Back Loan style. As such, I recommend that at that point you contact Companies House directly regarding this matter !\\n\\nTo find out if a fraudulent company was opened up in your name, you can search up your name on Companies House (or on Google, next to \"Companies House\") and discover what fraudulent companies you\\'ve been associated with and listed as a director on. Check for names, dates, addresses (fraudsters will usually use a fake address, but sometimes can and do use one of your real former or even current addresses), dates of birth, nationality, and other information.\\nYou should also look at the public Filing History of the company, which can give you additional information on what documents were submitted.\\nYou should also check to see if you can find other \"directors\" in that bogus company, know that they can either be the fraudsters themselves, or the fraudsters using another person\\'s stolen identity, note down everything you can about those individuals. \\nCheck to see what other companies you have been associated with as well, if there\\'s more than one.\\n\\nYou can then contact Companies House by email to dispute the company and your information showing up there, you can also submit certain forms which can help take down fraudulent information such as your director\\'s appointment which you did not consent to, make additional rectification (very useful in cases where there are additional forged and false documents in your name, such as documents with someone impersonating you with a false signature, etc), as well as remove one of your home addresses associated with the bogus company. *Companies House has a useful article here* : https://www.gov.uk/guidance/report-a-company-using-your-personal-details-without-your-permission \\n\\n**Below follows 3 very important and useful applications you can make if your information and stolen identity was used without your consent** :\\n- **1. Apply to Remove Material About a Director (RP06) -** This form is the most important when you\\'ve been a victim of identity theft and appointed as a fake director without your consent. When you submit this form, you report the company and Companies House will contact the company to send proof that you consented to act as a director, fraudsters don\\'t have any such proof, or at least don\\'t bother forging and sending any, so your information will be removed and you will receive a letter confirming that the company did not give evidence that you consented to be a director. Keep this letter safe, it will be extremely important, and is very useful in all future disputes you may have.\\n- Link to RP06 form here - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-to-remove-material-about-a-director-rp06 \\n\\n- **2. Apply for Rectification by the Registrar of Companies (RP02A) -** This form is useful when additional false and forged documents were submitted in your name. You can check for such documents in the Filing History of the company or by communicating with Companies House and asking them to check if there are any and if you should send them an RP02A form, but with this document you can remove such forged documents. The Registrar will also check to see if they are forged and false, and if they are, they will define this clearly under the reason for rectification in the letter that you will receive as confirmation. Keep this letter safe when you receive it, it is proof in your favour.\\n- Link to RP02A form here - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-rectification-by-the-registrar-of-companies-rp02a\\n\\n- **3. Apply to Change a Company\\'s Disputed Registered Office Address (RP07) -** This form is useful when the fraudsters used one of your own former home addresses or even an actual home address in the bogus company, thus exposing publicly where you live and putting you at even greater risk of being a victim of even more crime. You can submit this form along with supporting evidence and remove your home address from the fake company.\\n- Link to RP07 form here - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-to-change-a-companys-disputed-registered-office-address-rp07\\n\\n• **2.3 - Insolvency Service and HMRC.**\\nYou resort to the Insolvency Service when the Police and Action Fraud do not make progress in your case and want to try your best shot at getting the case investigated. The Insolvency Service works closely with the Police and can prosecute fraudsters.\\nIn certain cases, you may have to go further, the Insolvency Service can investigate fraudulent companies and misconduct or illegalities done by directors or company owners. They can look into both fraud as well as scam schemes. \\nYou can report to the Insolvency Service if you\\'ve been the victim of an impersonation fraud of a Business/Company style, or when reporting the fraudsters themselves and their own companies, if they have such companies and you happen to discover them.\\n- Link to Insolvency Service here for reporting fraudulent companies here - https://www.gov.uk/complain-company\\n\\nYou can report to HMRC when you\\'ve been a victim of identity theft and fraud on a more personal level, when fraudsters use your compromised identity to pretend that you\\'re working for a bogus company and are earning a lot more money than you actually are and paid more than you should and should then get tax refunds, they would try to change your tax code and alter your employment, leaving you with a lot of money to pay in taxes to HMRC.\\nFraudsters would also try to change your home address and correspondence address and this is VERY dangerous because they can then request to receive by post various documents in your name and find out your National Insurance number, to prevent this, actively check your HMRC account every now and then for the information on it. HMRC can also take legal action against the criminals and can prosecute them, which can work if you aren\\'t making much progress with Police or Action Fraud.\\n\\nTo report any of these, or any other type of fraud with your stolen identity to HMRC, you will have to find the relevant department for your query, you can check the link below for a list of relevant departments which you can contact. Depending on your situation, Income Tax, National Insurance, or other departments might be more relevant, make sure you contact any HMRC department and confirm which one is right for your issue :\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/contact-hmrc\\n\\n**Usually, the phone lines for HMRC are very busy on a daily basis and calls are impossible to make, so try instead to use Ask HMRC Online with the relevant departments, it is a form of webchat, this way you can reach out to them and communicate via text with an HMRC agent.**\\n- Link to contact HMRC here -  https://www.gov.uk/contact-hmrc\\n\\n• **2.4 - The Bank is being unhelpful, accusatory and is blaming you.**\\n\\nSometimes, and by sometimes I mean VERY RARELY, banks are helpful and are compassionate, understanding, and fair to victims of fraud and resolve their complaints, yes, so rarely that it is almost unheard of. However, from what I observed in the situations of others as well as from my own experience, the banks resort to blaming the victims of fraud and trying anything they can to hold the victims liable, which is something I want to address here.\\n\\nIf youre a victim of fraud, and the fraud has already been done and the bank is evil and careless, they may try to blame you, accuse you, call you a liar, call you a criminal and whatnot, and attempt to hold you liable by force. They may even try to tell you to give them every proof you have that you\\'ve been a victim of fraud only for them to then spin it in a way in which they can blame you, at least partially. You can use your own judgement here, but I will say that if in doubt, you may need to get legal advice from a lawyer or solicitor for what to say. But know that if the bank is hostile, then it is likely to use everything you give it and flip it against you to make you look bad, for example if you gave your compromised identity document online to a cyberscammer and you tell this to the bank, the bank may then blame you for \"willingly\" giving your identity document away to a criminal. Be careful. You do not have to comply with the bank\\'s demands either, and you don\\'t have to give them any more details other than what is essential and relevant. Know that the bank doesn\\'t care and is willing to get it\\'s money back from anywhere and anyone, even from victims of fraud. This is extremely scummy, and most victims of fraud know this, it\\'s a very dark reality of the banks unseen by most people, and this is why we suffer so much, but it\\'s sadly the way banks operate, don\\'t worry though, there are solutions. In the case where you lost your money to fraud and the bank didn\\'t lose it\\'s own money, it is likely to try everything it can to avoid refunding the losses into your bank account.\\n\\nAs such, know that it is wise to avoid entering pointless discourses and do not waste time, instead just show them the Action Fraud/Police crime reference number, reiterate that you\\'ve been a victim of a crime, and if they will accept it and close the case with you as a victim of fraud and solve the matter, then good, if not, you need to escalate by raising a Complaint, you will then get a Complaint reference number. \\n\\nYou can tell Customer Service that you want to make a Complaint, or you can look online on how to raise one with the bank, you will then be assigned a Complaint reference number, write this reference number down - it will be necessary later. You will then have a chance to describe the situation, the issue, what the bank has done wrong, and a Complaints Manager will look into the situation for you. That is when you should give the bank proof that you\\'ve been a victim of identity theft and fraud. In most cases, and with most banks, the Complaints Manager won\\'t be able to uphold the complaint AKA won\\'t resolve the complaint in your favour, this is because a bank rarely wants to admit it\\'s own mistakes and faults, and it\\'s interest will remain to get back the money it lost or to avoid refunding you the money that you lost, but at the very least, opening a Complaint will give you a chance to resolve the matter internally with the bank, as well as give you some time and space to breathe, it typically takes a few weeks to a month or more for a Complaint to be investigated, time during which you can figure out what to do next or at least get a little bit of peace. During an ongoing Complaint procedure, Debt Collectors and their debt collection activities can be put on hold too if you present them with the Complaint reference number.\\n\\n**If the bank does not uphold your Complaint, then your next step will be to complain to the Financial Ombudsman (explained below at 3. Final Escalation Efforts/Resolution).**\\n\\nApart from filing a Complaint, you should also make a DSAR request (DSAR = Data Subject Access Request), which is free and anyone can make, in order to see exactly what fraudulent information with your stolen identity exists on that bank\\'s system i.e. fraudulent applications, details, etc. You can find a section to apply for a DSAR on your bank\\'s website.\\nYou\\'ll be able to see what the bank says about you, what the bank\\'s agents and employees noted about you on their systems, and then you\\'ll have a far better picture of what happened and what is the stance of the bank, as well as documents which you may find to be helpful for your case, especially if the case would go to court. It gives you inside information into the data that the bank holds about you.\\n\\n**When you know inside information from the bank\\'s records, you can check for fraudulent details impersonating you, such as fraudulent applications you did not make, names that don\\'t match yours, email addresses that are not yours, phone numbers, addresses, I.P. addresses, bank accounts, timestamps, geolocation data, forged and false documents, false signatures, and other information which is not yours and you don\\'t recognise, but is instead pretending to be you.\\nWhen you know this information (which you are entitled to having access to), you can better dispute with the bank, and prove your innocence. This will be especially important to know if you will go to the Financial Ombudsman or if you will ever have to go to Court. This is why a DSAR request is important.**\\n\\nAlternatively, or when dealing with other banks and firms that may not have a DSAR procedure displayed on their website, you can either contact them directly and request a DSAR, or you can contact the Information Commissioner\\'s Office (also known as the ICO) and receive a DSAR through them, link is below.\\n- Link to Information Commissioner\\'s Office is here : https://ico.org.uk\\n\\n• **2.5 - Debt Collectors are sending letters, trying to get you to pay.**\\nDebt Collection agencies can be employed by banks and firms in order to harass you until you pay, these agencies don\\'t really care if you\\'ve been a victim of fraud and had your identity stolen, they\\'re hired mercenaries and will do whatever they\\'re legally able to do to get paid.\\n\\nIn most cases for many of us, our first instance of finding out that we\\'ve been victims of fraud happens when we start receiving letters from one such Debt Collection agency. \\n\\nIn the UK, Debt Collection agencies are not bailiffs, and there are limits to what they can do. They can send letters, write emails, text your phone or call your phone, and they can try to get into your home if your door or window are open or unlocked, or if you let them in, and then they can make an inventory of objects they can seize, take away with them and sell to cover the debt, but they cannot force their way into your property and cannot break down the door, and if you refuse to let them in, they will leave eventually, they will keep trying, but will leave. They may return for a few more times, in which case you can just keep everything closed and locked and avoid communicating with them until they leave.\\nBailiffs on the other hand can be used by HMRC, or by the Courts following legal settlements.\\n\\nWhen being visited by Debt Collectors, make sure your car is parked somewhere far away from your property so they do not seize it, also make sure your doors and windows are locked, and that your valuables and other items are kept safe. Again, don\\'t let them enter, they can be tricky and relentless and try to convince you to let them in, they can either make threats, or try to sweet-talk you and pretend to want to help you, don\\'t fall for it. Keep everything locked, avoid discourse, and wait until they leave.\\n\\nYou must understand that if you\\'ve been a victim of fraud, you should not pay after some criminals, know your rights! It may be a very tough and challenging process, and Debt Collection agencies can be extremely persistent, but it is possible to win out in the end if you stand your ground.\\n\\nThe first thing you must do if you get contacted by a Debt Collection agency, or when you receive a letter from them for a debt you don\\'t recognise, is to contact them directly, letting them know your identity was stolen and you\\'ve been a victim of fraud, they will then ask you for your Action Fraud crime reference number, which you must then give, and may ask for more details of the situation.\\n\\nAfterwards they will decide whether to pursue or to desist, if they decide to pursue, then avoid communication with them when possible, but when not, then keep standing your ground and resist falling prey to their schemes. In most cases you can put them on hold by raising a Complaint with the bank or creditor that was scammed and informing the Debt Collection agency of this Complaint reference number, and the harassment will be put on hold. This will at least keep them at bay for a while, giving you some peace. \\n\\nThe Debt Collection agency can also be put on hold when you bring your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman and provide them with the FOS case reference number. Financial Ombudsman cases at the current time of writing in February 2024 typically take a long time to resolve (6 months or longer), which can give you a longer break from having to deal with the Debt Collection agencies.\\n\\nAlso, Debt Collection agencies can\\'t hold you personally liable if you\\'ve been a victim of a company style fraud where the liability is on the company and not on you, such as in the case of a fraudulent Bounce Back Loan. However once again, they are still legally allowed to TRY to get money from you.\\n\\nIn my own case, I stood my ground and the debt collection agency that was after me decided to give up, recognising that this is a genuine and sensible case of stolen identity where they believe the best thing to do is to cease all recovery action and return the responsibility of the matter back to the bank. I was very lucky, and I had to persist a lot to the point where I was brought to tears trying to explain to them that this is not right, but this shows that it is possible to win out in the end by standing your ground. However it may not be easy, it can be a very rocky road. You need to stand strong and keep going.\\n\\n**More advice and help with debt, debt collection agencies, and what to do in situations of stolen identity and fraud can be acquired through the companies and charities listed below, which i HIGHLY recommend** : \\n\\n- 1.

In this case, I want to remind you of the importance of contacting your GP or your Medical Practitioner and requesting help from them. They can assess you, can give you a diagnosis, can offer advice for your situation, and can refer you to undergo therapy and receive Mental Health support, and may even prescribe you medication if they think it is right to do so. \\nYou will also be able to request from them printed copies of the doctor\\'s notes and diagnostics, and can speak to them to request a Private Letter to attest to the crisis you experienced. This will be very helpful to add to your file. Know that it may cost a fee (it may cost £40 if I\\'m not mistaken). Also, notes from your therapist from your mental health sessions will also be very useful and helpful to have in your file.\\n\\nTherapy is extremely helpful and speaking from my own experience, it helped me to deal with the stress, depression and crisis surrounding my own case, it helps bring release and it also helps to untangle complex emotions and ways of thinking, making you understand yourself better and knowing how to change and change unhelpful patterns and begin to feel better.\\n\\nYou will find more information by contacting your GP/Medical Practitioner, which is what I advise you to do, unless it\\'s an emergency in which case please call 999 and seek urgent help now (or the emergency phone number in your country).\\n\\n**You may find additional useful information in the links below** : \\n- 1.

Final Escalation Efforts/Resolution.**\\n\\n• **3.1 - Resorting to the Financial Ombudsman.**\\nIn the UK, when you\\'ve raised a Complaint with the Bank or firm, and the complaint was not resolved or upheld in your favour, your next course of action is to bring your complaint about the business to the Financial Ombudsman. You can choose whether you want to go to the Financial Ombudsman, or get legal advice and consider declaring bankruptcy (which COULD work, but I don\\'t quite recommend, also, you need to get legal support and advice for this), or wait and see what the bank intends to do next (which can be very bad to do), or you can take legal action yourself and go to court (very dangerous, and very expensive, its advisable that you do not do this unless absolutely necessary). Usually what some people do is wait a while and think, before then deciding to go to the Financial Ombudsman as their next course of action.\\n\\n**The Investigator and Ombudsman are usually very helpful, and they can be far more understanding of the situation and your perspective than the bank will ever be. When first raising the complaint with them, you must of course define the resolution you seek (which I listed examples of above, for example to write off the fraudulent loan, to undo damage to the credit score, to cease debt collection activity, etc). If you\\'re currently getting chased by Debt Collectors, you can also give them the Financial Ombudsman reference number and put them on hold.**\\n**The Investigator aims to see exactly what the bank has done wrong, so you need to show them proof of wrongdoing, you must also show them any supporting documentation and evidence that you have, including of damage that the situation and the bank\\'s mistakes may have caused. In most cases, the Investigator alone will be enough to resolve your complaint, but in some cases you may find that you need the Ombudsman to review the complaint, be careful here, the Investigator could uphold your Complaint where the Ombudsman would not, and the Ombudsman\\'s decision is final and irreversible.**\\n\\n- Link to the Financial Ombudsman Service website is here : https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\\n\\n- Link to the Financial Conduct Authority Principles is here : https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/PRIN/2/1.html', 'comments': [\"Also, my original post was going to be a lot longer, I had to ommit a few parts of my post in order to be able to post it due to word count limits, I wish to add below the parts I ommited : \\n\\n**3.1 - Additional Financial Ombudsman Information**\\n\\nThe Financial Ombudsman is a free service set up by Parliament to mediate and resolve disputes between individuals and businesses. It is independent, impartial, fair, and objective, and acts as an alternative to the courts and has the legal powers to put things right. If the Financial Ombudsman upholds your complaint and you accept their decision, then it will be legally binding on the business whether the business agrees with the decision or not, they will have to do what has been decided they should do to make things right. The Financial Ombudsman can help with cases of frauds and scams, including those of ID theft. Some of the things that the service can achieve if your complaint is upheld is to make the business in question write off a fraudulent loan, to stop debt collection activity, to remove hard searches and undo the damage caused to your credit score/credit report, and to make the firm pay you a compensation fee for the damage that has been caused to you and which you suffered. \\n\\nI have found this service to be extremely helpful and useful, but can be lengthy. In my case it took me a full 6 months for my situation to be resolved. It takes a long amount of time for the Investigator/Adjudicator to get in touch and make their Provisional Decision, roughly 2 or 3 months, and then if you decide you disagree with their decision and want the case to be reviewed judicially by an Ombudsman, you may have to wait another 3 or 4 months, or longer. \\n\\n**Also, the Financial Ombudsman service takes into account the Financial Conduct Authority Principles when forming their decisions. If you have a quick read over those principles, you will be better able to explain the principles that the bank has breached and broken in your case, and you can better show what the bank has done wrong in this case. I have added at the bottom of this section a link to the FCA Principles Handbook.**\\n\\nIn my case, my complaint was not technically upheld due to the technicalities surrounding the situation, however it was favourable towards me as the bank was told it cannot hold me personally liable, and it also must apply to the Government to refund the fraudulent Bounce Back Loan after exhausting it's recovery methods, which again, cannot hold me personally liable. Therefore it was favourable, whilst still allowing the bank to try.\\n\\n- Link to the Financial Ombudsman Service website is here : https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\\n\\n- Link to the Financial Conduct Authority Principles is here : https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/PRIN/2/1.html\\n\\n• **3.2 Final Thoughts.**\\nFinally, I'd like to just say that declaring bankruptcy is another possible course of action, but it is tricky and can be dangerous, you may lose assets or you may not, so do not take it lightly, instead try to inform yourself as much as you can and seek legal advice for your situation.\\n\\nGetting debt advice and guidance from debt charities and helplines can also be useful, though they can only do so much, they may advise you to agree to a consolidation plan, or to only pay very small increments of the debt on a monthly basis, but whatever they advise you to do, it is your decision what to actually do, and in the cases of stolen identity and fraud, giving in and paying for a criminal should not be seen as an option.\\n\\nAlso, taking the bank to court can have dire consequences so I do not recommend anyone to do that unless as an absolute last resort. The bank has a lot of money and, chances are, it can pay a more experienced solicitor or lawyer. If you lost your own money to a scam, and it's a huge amount of money which the bank refuses to refund you, and you exhausted other avenues such as the FOS service, and you know you're in the right and can back it up, but you didn't get the result you want and you know its within reach, then you may go this route. However if the fraudsters impersonated you and defrauded the bank and the bank lost it's own money, then it's not your responsibility to go to court, the bank is also unlikely to go to court, this is a criminal case and as such it must be dealt with by the police, the bank is unlikely to take you to court, and if it does, you can then defend yourself. \\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nI hope all of this information helps the victims of identity theft and fraud of this Reddit community, as well as victims of identity theft and fraud in general.

After purchasing the \\'products\\', you send them a payment slip as evidence of you actually purchasing and they\\'ll supposedly pay you back the original amount of cash you paid for the product AND the commission they promised. \\n3. It starts from small amounts such as rm 5 --> rm 25 --> rm50 --> rm100 and you get 8% commission for all these transactions, sounds like easy money and they gain your trust already. \\n4. The higher cost transactions will be around rm500 and this is where they\\'ll start to test how far they can take you, they call this the \\'vip lounge\\' or something cringe, so you thinking you\\'re earning easy commission money through making such sales, you let your guard down. \\n5. The scammers think they have extracted enough from you then they\\'ll come and give excuses on why they cannot reimburse your cash and commission anymore, late on payment, transaction did not comply etc etc . Basically just ignore and block you after that. \\n6. You lose high amount of money from the \\'product\\' you were supposed to be reimbursed back. Not to mention, the \\'product\\' probably doesnt even exist so there\\'s that. \\n\\n**Lazada Scam # Type 3: Making transactions outside of Lazada platform** \\n\\n**How the scam works and what you should do** \\\\[[Source: Lazada](https://www.lazada.com.my/helpcenter/how-to-protect-yourself-from-scams-12783.html)\\\\]: \\n\\n* Scammers block your contact after receiving your payment, with no delivery or refund issued. \\n* Off-platform transactions **are not protected** by Lazada, so always buy and transact within the Lazada platform.\\n\\n**What you should do if you are scammed on Lazada** (by u/sasa86): \\n\\n1. Compile all screenshots, especially the part where the \\'seller\\' promises refund \\n2. Make a police report, claiming fraud \\n3. Forward a copy of police report and compiled screenshots to Lazada, as the platform strictly prohibits sellers from conducting sales outside the platform \\n4. Once Lazada confirms receipt of said report, forward it to the \\'seller\\' together with a copy of the police report AND state that you will pursue legal action if the money is not refunded by XX days \\n5. When making statements to police or Lazada or \\'seller\\', be calm and not be too angry when \\'seller\\' replies to ask you for more time or delay, just shut him off and say sorry, please refund by XX days, then don\\'t say anything more than necessary\\n\\n# SCAM TYPE 15: CAROUSELL \\n\\n[Source: https:\\\\/\\\\/www.carousell.com.my\\\\/p\\\\/scam-be-aware-of-this-people-and-this-kind-of-email-141458605\\\\/](https://preview.redd.it/pm8pbfgfqm381.jpg?width=404&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97bcba4982ecfb98c06ee83834c08be227f7d964)\\n\\n**How the scam works:**\\n\\n1.

It starts from small amounts such as rm 5 --> rm 25 --> rm50 --> rm100 and you get 8% commission for all these transactions, sounds like easy money and they gain your trust already.\\n4. The higher cost transactions will be around rm500 and this is where they\\'ll start to test how far they can take you, they call this the \\'vip lounge\\' or something else, so you thinking you\\'re earning easy commission money through making such sales, you let your guard down.\\n5.
