As we had accumulated a lot of stuff with being unfurnished, decided to quickly find a man and a van to help move all of our belongings.\\n\\nHere in comes\\xa0CompareTheManandVan.co.uk. Now from the outside the website doesn\\'t look great, which should have been a red flag, however I thought these types of companies probably don\\'t hire UX designers, and went ahead with booking a van through them about 6 weeks prior to moving. They\\'re also the first to pop up on google, and thought this may have been an indicator for trust.\\n\\nI went through the selection process, but as I was still a bit cautious, I paid for a deposit now (£140) and the rest on the day (£170), which turned out to be a saviour. I received a confirmation email from this, with a number and a name for the driver, so I thought it all seemed legitimate, and felt like I had a van in place and could prepare everything else for the move.\\n\\nFast forward to 4 days before the end of tenancy date, and I haven\\'t heard anything from the the driver, or CompareTheManandVan, apart from that confirmation email. I decided to try and call the number they provided. The number that was given was a complete stranger, who had no idea about who I was or about van/removals at all. I call the company themselves, and met with a \"User Busy\" message and no way of contacting them, apart from the online web chat tool which is useful. After a few hours of trying, I had nothing.\\n\\nThis is when the panic started, as we had only a few days to try and find a replacement before our move out date, with all the other providers and options to rent a van myself having been 3 times the original price I had seen, which was not going to be affordable. Fortunately I managed to find a number for a removals company on a Facebook group, which came in clutch in the end for nearer the same price. As for the £140 deposit, I thought I had to chalk this up as a loss, but after having spoken to Natwest they came to refund me the £140, and reported the company on my behalf.\\n\\nSo if you are planning on moving any time soon, do not use\\xa0CompareTheManAndVan.co.uk, and make sure to due your due diligence in finding a reliable company that can help you.\\n\\nA small rant, is that this is such a disgusting way to scam people, due to the high pressures involved with a house move, and having to put all your trust with your belongings to an individual. Having read the trustpilot reviews (which are shocking), they have left people at the end of their tenancy with all their belongings outside of their house, as they haven\\'t turned up, or con them for more money before agreeing to take their stuff to the new place.\\n\\nI hope this helps someone else, and be safe out there!', 'comments': ['Best thing to do if you are unsure on a man and van service is to ask at your local self-storage site.

The only issue I had was the guy turning up in a smaller van than I had selected, luckily we still fit everything in. \\n\\nI believe the website just pools contractors who sign up to it, so it’s purely a middle-man rather than supplying the removals service to you. So, I think your issue is more so with the contractor itself rather than the website if the guy didn’t turn up.']}, {'title': 'The HUGE Significance of 11/14 or 11/5', 'subreddit': 'TheGreatDeception', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGreatDeception/comments/9jw4p8/the_huge_significance_of_1114_or_115/', 'selftext': 'After my last post about Regulus and bringing up the Nov 14th date spoken about in the Trackdown - End of the World Episode again, I started doing some more digging.

It was discovered by French astronomer Henri Joseph Perrotin on April 26, 1876, and named after one of the two Erigones in Greek mythology.  \\n>  \\n>Erigone is a relatively large and dark asteroid with an estimated size of 73\\xa0km. Based upon its spectrum, it is classified as a C-type asteroid, which indicates that it probably has a carbonaceous composition.  \\n>  \\n>**2014 occultation of Regulus**  \\n>  \\n>In the early morning hours of March 20, 2014, Erigone occulted the first-magnitude star Regulus as first predicted by A. Vitagliano in 2004. This would have been a rare case of an occultation of a very bright star visible from a highly populated area, since the shadow path moved across New York state and Ontario, including all five boroughs of New York City. Observers in the shadow path would have seen the star wink out for as long as 14 seconds.  \\n>  \\n>However, heavy clouds and rain blocked the view for most if not all people on the shadow path. The website of the International Occultation Timing Association does not list any successful observations at all.  \\n>  \\n>Two single chord Asteroid Occultation events have been observed, in 2013 and 2014\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe fact that no one actually witnessed it is REALLY interesting and must play some sort of dynamic to all of this.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe name Erigone seems to refer to 2 different Greek goddesses\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erigone\\\\_(daughter\\\\_of\\\\_Icarius)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erigone_(daughter_of_Icarius))\\n\\n>Icarius was cordial towards Dionysus, who gave his shepherds wine. They became intoxicated and killed Icarius, thinking he had poisoned them. His daughter, Erigone, and her dog, Maera, found his body. Erigone hanged herself over her father\\'s grave. Dionysus was angry and punished Athens by making all of the city\\'s maidens commit suicide in the same way. Erigone was placed in the stars as the constellation Virgo.  \\n>  \\n>According to Ovid, Dionysus \"deceived Erigone with false grapes\", that is, assumed the shape of a grape cluster to approach and seduce her.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDionysus was the god of winemaking. He was responsible for the growth of the vines.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>**John 15**  \\n>  \\n>\"I am the true vine and my Father is the gardener. 2 He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSounds like this one is associated with an Antichrist like Figure pretending to be Jesus since wine represents his blood.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erigone\\\\_(daughter\\\\_of\\\\_Aegisthus)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erigone_(daughter_of_Aegisthus))\\n\\n>Erigone would have been slain by Orestes along with her brother Aletes if not for the intervention of Artemis, who rescued her and made her a priestess in Attica. In some stories, she hangs herself after the child is born, though this may be a confusion with Erigone, daughter of Icarius. Also, after Hermione died, she is said to have married Orestes and gave birth to Penthilus. Or it is said she sued Orestes to murder of her parents.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOrestes murdered his own mother then went crazy.  Satan/Yahweh have other gods related to them where they are rejected by their mothers or don\\'t have one, which is why they are narcissists who hate women and why we he kicks Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden (Mother Nature) and curses women to be subservient to men (read more about this idea [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGreatDeception/comments/98sdag/the_first_great_deception_the_neolithic_revolution/)). Revelation speaks of the Red Dragon trying to kill a newborn baby and the woman who birthed him. She then goes somewhere in the wilderness, where God held a place for her until its time. God in this story apparently, is Artemis or Diana. She\\'s not dead, she\\'s just hiding until Orestes (humanity) attones for what he did. This stuff correlates to so much more, I might have to make another post just about this.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI came across this date (11/14) towards the beginning of my journey and I never went back looking into it because it felt like a dead end besides a couple of VERY key significances. Nov 14th is both the day the \"Great Comet\" is discovered in 1680 and the day that Einstein presented his Quantum Theory of Light in 1908. Looking at this list now, I see WAY more correlations with this to the point it\\'s getting ridiculous. And it seems this date is a sort of pendulum point in time because we have instances of people winning their freedoms, overtaking governments and rulers being killed and we have instances of enslavement, attacks and new kings getting crowned. I wonder which way Earth is going to go in this timeline.

However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by Te Kā, a volcanic demon, losing both his magical giant fishhook and the heart to the depths.\\n\\nA millennium later, Moana, daughter of Motunui\\'s chief Tui, is chosen by the ocean to return the heart to Te Fiti. However, Tui arrives and takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Space & Exploration Related\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>1524 Francisco Pizarro begins his 1st great expedition, near Colombia  \\n>  \\n>1792 Captain George Vancouver is first Englishman to enter San Francisco Bay\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSomething to do with Pope Francis?

Trump has repeatedly said he would expose 9/11 and I\\'ve had this theory for a while that he would use this information to end the investigation and take complete power.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>1976 War criminal Pieter Menten captured 1 day after fleeing\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHe was a Nazi. A Dutch writer was involved in his capture. I\\'m noticing a lot of references to the Dutch. Apparently they were very complicit in atrocities of Nazi Germany and they had the highest percentage of Jewish deaths in Western Europe, 75% of them died. A lot of Nazi\\'s actually hid out in these areas to avoid capture. The Little Baron Trump books say he changed his name to a Dutch name. Trump himself lied and said his father was Swedish. I think it\\'s pretty obvious what this means.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Miscellaneous\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>1666 Samuel Pepys reports on 1st blood transfusion (between dogs)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlmost seems like an illusion to genetic manipulation. The Greeks called the city where they worshiped the Egyptian god of the Underworld Anubis, the \"city of the dog\". Jesus referred to a Canaanite woman as a dog once. Trump also called Omarosa a \"dog\". Keeping with my theory that almost 100% of the negative things Trump says about a person are projection, which means he\\'s really talking about himself, this is very interesting. Especially with his love for Black and Gold color schemes on his \"Towers\" which is very Egyptian. Ramses II also had red hair. Which means he was an Edomite. Ramses II is mentioned specifically on Cleopatra\\'s Needle, one of which is a mile away from the black inverted obelisk that is Trump Tower. Ramses II sounds an AWFUL lot like Trump. Loved to build monuments to himself and over exaggerated his accomplishments. He is very revered though and thought of as a great Pharaoh, according to what was written about him at least.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>1675 Pope Clemens X declares Gorcumse martyrs divine\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThey were 19 Catholics who were killed for being Catholics\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>1832 First streetcar (horse-drawn) (John Mason) debuts in NYC; fare 12 cents rode on 4th Avenue between Prince and 14th Sts\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe Mars Rover was literally just driven around NYC\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>1896 Power plant at Niagara Falls begins operation\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nImplying a new power or power source is coming?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>1967 The Congress of Colombia in commemoration of the 150 years of the death of Policarpa Salavarrieta, declares this day as \"Day of the Colombian Woman\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nColumbia was originally a name for the goddess of America, which is essentially Lady Liberty.
