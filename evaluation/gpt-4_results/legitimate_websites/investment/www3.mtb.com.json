Has my Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage been affected? Accounts you opened at People’s United prior to the merger with M&T Bank will continue to be insured by the FDIC If you had deposit accounts with both M&T Bank and the People’s United division of M&T Bank prior to the merger, the FDIC will separately insure those deposit accounts for six months after the merger (on April 2, 2022) Any M&T Bank deposit account you had prior to the merger and new deposit accounts established after the merger, including those opened with the People’s United division of M&T Bank, will not be separately insured. They will be combined to determine applicable FDIC insurance limits. This is because the People’s United division of M&T Bank and M&T Bank are now the same FDIC-insured institution Special Information for Certificates of Deposit (CDs): Any CD you have at People’s United Bank, N.A. prior to the merger (on April 2, 2022) is separately insured until its next maturity date after the six-month period following the merger If your former People’s United Bank CD automatically renews within six months of the merger, it will continue to be separately insured until its next maturity date The six-month transition period gives you the opportunity to consider how to maximize FDIC deposit insurance coverage for your accounts.

Since the error with Twitter prevents me from obtaining further social proof, I will now make a final decision based on the available evidence. I now know the final answer.
