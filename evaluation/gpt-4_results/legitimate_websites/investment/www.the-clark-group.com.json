It is unclear how Owen and Curtis knew each other though Clark’s girlfriend lived across the street from where Curtis lived. Curtis, called Corky by his family, planned to spend the night across the street at Clark’s girlfriend’s home and told his mother that he and Clark planned to go driving. Curtis’s mother, however, noted that they left on foot. Curtis and Clark arrived at Clark’s girlfriend’s house, which she shared with her four children but, left later that evening saying they were going to borrow her car for a ride. However, the girlfriend observed both leaving the house on foot and told authorities that neither drove the car. \\n\\nEarly the next morning at 4:30 AM, Owen Clark walked alone into the local fire station with burns covering 70% of his body. Clark later informed authorities that he had been walking along Thornton Avenue when he was approached by a group of four young men in a car who offered him a ride. Clark turned them down but, the men exited the car, robbed him of $420, and doused him in flammable fluid before lighting it and driving off. Clark rolled in the grass to extinguish the flames then made his way to the fire station. \\n\\nClark told authorities that he had last seen Curtis at 11:00 PM. He said he and Curtis had driven to a store to pick up items at a store near Thornton Ave and Illinois Highway 7. Curtis and Clark got into an argument at the store so Clark decided to go on a walk to cool off, where he was accosted by the men. Curtis had driven his girlfriend’s car back to the house. Authorities found the car at the girlfriend’s house with the keys still in the ignition. \\n\\nAuthorities suspect foul play in Curtis’s case and Clark was named as a suspect, however, he is now deceased and was never charged in relation to Curtis’s case. Curtis was 14 years old when he disappeared and had brown hair and blue eyes. Curtis is white and has an enlarged left ear. He has a scar on the left side of his head that is concealed by his hair and a scar on his abdomen from an appendectomy. He was last seen wearing a dark blue t-shirt, jean shorts, and red sneakers. He stood at 5’2 and weighed 134 pounds.

        "thought": "The SSL certificate for \"the-clark-group.com\" is valid and issued by Let's Encrypt, a widely recognized certificate authority. The certificate is also relatively fresh, with an issuance date of April 14, 2024, and an expiration date of July 13, 2024. This suggests that the website is taking basic security measures to ensure encrypted communications, which is a good sign and not typical of many scam websites. After reviewing the WHOIS data, extracting text, searching for online discussions, and checking the SSL certificate, I have not found any definitive evidence that \"the-clark-group.com\" is a scam website. The WHOIS data indicates a longstanding domain presence, and while there is a generic email address, it does not conclusively point to a scam. Additionally, there are no widespread reports or significant discussions online that suggest the website is known for scam activities. I now know the final answer. Based on the analysis, there is no substantial evidence to classify \"the-clark-group.com\" as a scam website. The indicators that could suggest a scam are not present or are insufficient to draw that conclusion.",
