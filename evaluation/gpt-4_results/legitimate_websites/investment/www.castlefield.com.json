As such, knowing I want to stay in Manchester, I was considering buying in Ancoats.\\n\\nI’ve had a look around quite a few places of varying quality. Some have ticked most of the obvious boxes and as such I have stalked some of the respective Facebook communities to get an idea of who is living there and what is is like. Ive discovered some worrying things - people in Nuovo seem to keep getting their parcels signed for by others and stolen, whilst Advent 1/2/3 seem to be having issues with non residents getting into communal areas and vomiting everywhere.\\n\\nI guess in the grand scheme, these are small things - as long as my property is nice.. but when making the biggest investment of my life what I really want is as close to perfection:\\n\\n- a nice modern 2 bed apartment! >750sqft <£250,000\\n- reasonable, accountable service charges. Happy to pay more if it’s worth it.. e.g concierge and swimming pool\\n- around Ancoats. Ideally low crime, friendly neighbours, good amenities, quiet etc etc\\n\\nObviously the best way to work it out is to rent, but I can’t rent everywhere. As such I figured I’d ask here. Does anyone have any experiences of buildings in the area from having rented/owned in the area previously? Anyone know of any obvious new builds that are high quality, available, and relatively near completion? Anyone got any general insights to help someone a bit out of their depth? :P\\n\\nMany thanks !', 'comments': [\"I wouldn't go with advent. Looked around one there, thought it was a bit shit. Ended up in neighbouring albion mill, much better.  Keep an eye on Picadilly village, although dunno if it's still in your price range\", \"I'd be looking at Murray Mills if I was you: http://mcrlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MurraysMill-Brochure-Oct17.pdf\", \"I lived on the top floor of Advent 3.  The corner of the roofing peeled back and let water through... A lot of water. There was a literal waterfall through the ceiling hatch in the corridor. Neighbours sand bagged their front doors.  Water was leaking through the inside of my windows. It took a while to fix it and then there was a lot of arguments between the landlord and the owners of the building over who's responsible to pay. (This was back in 2010/11). The roofing is glorified shed felt that peeled back in the wind (they bolted it down in the end). \\n\\nSo I wouldn't really recommend it.  It's fine for young professionals wanting to rent a cheap flat for a bit (well, it used to be cheap), but I wouldn't want the responsibility of owning one of them.  Apparently it's a German design that doesn't really suit British weather.  \\n\\nOther than that, it's a pretty basic set up. Everything's a bit on the cheap side.  If you can afford better, go elsewhere (especially as advent flats aren't really even that cheap anymore). Can't say I noticed people throwing up everywhere though.\", 'An area called ‘Platting Village’ is being built in Miles Platting about 5 mins away. The thing is to bear in mind that as much as Ancoats and these areas have been tarted up, they’re still glorified council estates and have the crime rates to match.', \"I live in a Lovells new build just a quick walk from Ancoats.  For less than what you'd pay, we have a large enough 3 bedroom house, with decent garden spaces and secure drive. There's a lot of chat about low-level crime in the area, but we never see any and it's generally really quiet.\\n\\nThere are council houses in the area, but their value is going up by association as
