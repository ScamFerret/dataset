It\\'s propped up as a \"good\" thing because it promotes ***choice***! And in the good ol\\' American spirit, choice is what\\'s best!\\n\\nExcept this is a fallacy. It\\'s an illusion. It\\'s a false choice, and here\\'s why:\\n\\n1. You already have choice. You can leave at any point in time and go elsewhere. Problem is you might not be accepted everywhere...or anywhere...else. Thus the one option that must serve you, not matter what, must be funded. You don\\'t ***have*** to choose it, but it\\'s there for you no matter what.\\n2. Education is a public utility, just like public roads or electricity or water. If you ***choose*** not to use these things, you do not simply get to stop paying taxes that support these things. Why? Because in the future if you want the ability to ***choose*** to use them, they must exist for you to be able to use them. \\n3. Those funds you receive isn\\'t ***your*** money it\\'s your ***community\\'s*** money. Therefore it is obligated to be under the same accountability as any other ***community*** property, and follow all community guidelines. If you wish to teach your children that the Nazi\\'s were right and that Hitler was a hero...that\\'s your prerogative. It is, however, not one the public has any obligation to fund or support. Therefore, you must do so out of your own pocket.\\n4. School \"Choice\" is a false one; because you already have choice. One of the choices you have is provided to you and obligated to serve you under any and all circumstances.\\n5. It amounts to a free handout for the wealthy. The wealthiest will always choose private over public to help perpetuate the myth of meritocracy. The foundational principle of that myth is that *they* are better than *you.* They go to \"Elite\" schools, where you do not. They will always have access, and they will always gatekeep you from joining the club. Vouchers perpetuates this because you\\'re rewarding them financially for what they already do. Whereas without vouchers, they still pay taxes that support the local schools despite them ***choosing*** not to use them. Thus with vouchers, they get a payback to drain your schools (that they weren\\'t already using) so they can take and extra week vacation to the Maldives. \\n6. This goes with the previous one: vouchers amount to nothing more than a war on poor people. Private institutions will always cost more than the cost of the vouchers (gatekeeping), and if for some reason you can no longer keep up with the additional cost, you\\'ll be kicked back to the now heavily defunded public schools that are obligated to support you. So the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.', 'comments': ['Homeschooling parent. I agree with you 100٪. \\n\\nAll the voucher programs will do is erode the public schools to the point that they can\\'t be maintained and drive the cost of private options up. The \"choice\" of the wealthy will remove any option at all for the poor and working class.', 'Absolutely. It\\'s the ultimate \"congratulations, you played yourself.\" A strong public education system is a pillar of our democracy, and one of the key reasons we\\'ve enjoyed the successes we have as a country.', 'School choice (via vouchers) benefits wealthy parents who can transport their kids anywhere in the city, and would probably have been fine without it. \\n\\nBut politicians pander to the wealthy anyway. I’m not surprised they’re doing this in the education context. No one gets re-elected by pissing off the wealthy.', \"I'm glad I'm in an area where public schools will accept transfers from other districts. I would not want to send my son to the school that we're zoned for, but the next town over where I teach is a much better school district. But there's almost no housing, and definitely none that we can afford to move into right now. So when he starts school, I can apply to transfer him, and as long as he maintains good grades, attendance, and discipline, he'll be able to continue. \\n\\nIt's not the same situation as vouchers for private schools, but I do like being able to choose without having to move to a new house.\", \"Parents pushing for school choice are doing it because their local school sucks and they can't afford alternatives. They just want a way to get a good education for their kid and the local school isn't providing it.\\n\\nThe wealthy actually tend to be anti-school choice because they don't want the middle class entering their schools.\"]}]"
