The references are quite old, and there is no context indicating that the site is a scam. However, the lack of recent discussion could also mean the site isn't widely used or discussed among Reddit users. Given the information from the website content, the WHOIS data, and the lack of negative social proof from Reddit, there are no strong indicators at this point to suggest that dailywealth.com is a scam website. It appears to be a legitimate investment advice service associated with Stansberry Research.
