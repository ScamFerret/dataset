Especially without a clear transfer of risk via INCO terms. \\n\\nThis is a scam. They shouldn’t have your info, shouldn’t be holding up your package, if there is a customs or payment issue, they should be looking to the sender, not the receiver. The way they are doing this is because they are 100% in coordination with the seller. Meaning this is a calculated coherent scam. \\n\\nNot your lawyer, not legal advice.']}]"

        "thought": "The Reddit search did not yield any results related to \"Finway International\" being involved in a scam. However, the search did return results of various scams involving international dealings, which indicates that scams of this nature are common but do not specifically point to the URL in question. I have gathered information about the website's content, checked its SSL certificate, looked for public opinion, and attempted to get WHOIS data. The information from the website seems legitimate, and there is a valid SSL certificate. The absence of direct scam accusations related to the specific entity in the search results and social media searches does not raise immediate red flags. While I was unable to retrieve WHOIS data, this does not necessarily indicate a scam. Based on the actions taken and observations made, there is not enough evidence to conclusively label the website as a scam. I now know the final answer. Based on the information gathered and the lack of evidence pointing to a scam, the URL https://finway.co.za/ does not appear to be a scam website.",
