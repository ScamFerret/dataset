MGD has provided excellent strategic and investment advice, especially around moving from a defined benefits superannuation account to market-based options that align with my personal goals and values. I remain a very satisfied MGD client. Professor Adele Green AC FAA FAHMS My wife and I have experienced a mix of Australian and expat lives for many years now and very recently headed offshore again. With the ever increasing complexities of financial advice both here in Australia and abroad, we found that the lines had become blurred and we had far more questions than answers. We needed solid advice and a strategy to navigate us through to retirement and beyond. When we first contacted MGD we were lucky enough to meet and deal with Jess. Jess immediately impressed us with her “take” on our unique financial situation and continued to impress as she methodically and punctually provided us with a solid strategic plan to guide us through the next phases of our financial life. We have been very comfortable working with Jess and look forward to expanding our relationship with her and MGD as we fine tune our finances into the future. Cameron B. I am a retired airline pilot, returning to Australia in 2019 after nearly two decades working for Cathay Pacific Airways based in Hong Kong. Retiring at age 55 posed many questions about my financial future. What next? How can I ensure a stable and comfortable retirement without undue risk? How about my tax obligations as an expatriate returning to my domicile? MGD has given me that peace of mind. Since early 2019 when I first met Richard Marsden in Hong Kong, a thorough and ongoing assessment of my personal financial situation and future goals has been assured. Financial markets are incredibly complex and the investment options very diverse. MGD has a team of highly professional people who provide the highest level of guidance, due diligence and transparency. Thanks MGD. Paul M. I have always enjoyed excellent advice and assistance from Rachel. I value her advice highly and I am very happy with her efficient service. I followed Rachel to MGD Wealth from her previous company. I will always be loyal to MGD Wealth whilst Rachel is my adviser. Elizabeth N. Andrew has always provided us with well informed financial and investment advice throughout our many years of doing business with MGD Wealth. Now in our retirement years, he has guided us to the establishment of a secure financial base. Andrew has always been available for us to seek advice on any enquiries we may have. Ross P. We have always been given sound advice and have been appreciative of the outcome of our investment strategies, even in tough times. Graeme has always gone the extra mile to make us feel that our portfolio and investment strategies have been catered specially to our needs and that he cares not only about our financial welfare, but also our general well-being. Kathy M. Lindsay's service and advice throughout the years has been simply amazing. He thinks ahead and advises on issues, risks and opportunities before I could see them. He is proactive and also amazing to talk to and deal with. I have not met a better adviser. Hamid P. I really enjoy working with Stephen Furness with his extremely professional approach and guidance in understanding our (my wife and I) journey to securing financial retirement while allowing for current financial needs and investment. Stephen evolves the plan with us giving us a factual understanding of the choice options we can make. Dave G. Mikaela helped guide us through the process of placing my husband into aged care with expertise and compassion. She was patient and caring and followed up at every step of the journey. It is a very stressful and confusing time and I have no hesitation in recommending her to anyone who is going through the same process. Maureen K. • Sign up to the newsletter Thank you!
