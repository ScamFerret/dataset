It is just one of a string of scam projects created by convicted fraudster Barry Hayward from Preston in England. He also goes by the name James Hayward, but has been known to use a list of fake names including Xander Garrison, Barry Hayward, David Hayward, James Hayward, Starlord, Cypher, Jamie de Souza, Jamie Desouza, Colin Hayward, Carlos de Souza, Barry Howard, Raymond Calitri, James Ward, David Heywood, Barry Heywood, Barry David Heywood plus many more.\\n\\nHe has served previous prison sentences for theft and fraud and has committed these crimes using a variety of methods including common theft, fraudulent use of a credit card, fake businesses, diamond trading, online shops, fake eBay sales, car services and parts, computer sales, receiving goods without paying, IT and gaming equipment, race simulator equipment, crypto brokerage and crypto projects.\\nHis scam companies in the past have included, OP Performance, Officially Pimped, Oppjapparts, Tech Carbon, Carbon Fibre Creation, Carbon Creations, Carbon Edge, UK dipping centre Ltd, Sim Rigs Ltd, VPCUK Ltd, Crypto Brokerage Ltd, FQ Autotech Ltd, Simplyoffroad, Kyoshiracing, Crotchrocket, BMWeurope, ChipGuru, Autobahnperformance, GoparcelGo, Habitus, Hashdigger, x2bitcoins, Hourbitcoins, Bitabay and Turn17 Ltd, plus many more.\\n\\nHis activity within the crypto space quickly earned him the reputation of a fraudster regardless of which name he tried to hide under, his proven scam projects to date are Galaxium, Galaxium Phoenix, Supremium, Lego, Apex Realms and Uphoria Metaverse.\\nHe has also been found to have links with Lavabird, Indu-Ultra, Olyx-4, Lazy Shiba and more.\\n\\nAlthough Barry Hayward is the ring leader in these scam projects, his mods have also followed him from project to project and like him have also tried to mask their identity by creating fake names. They were instructed by Hayward to obtain new mobile SIM cards and new identities on telegram, delete old telegram groups, abandon investors and move on to the next scam. We obtained screenshots of leaked private admin chats which can prove this.\\nHayward has a history of slow rug pulls and liquidy theft, and is known for disappearing with presale earnings after failing to launch projects.\\nHe has blamed the past projects failures on investors selling, bots, FUD, members of the team stealing, marketing companies stealing, lied about spending money on magazine and game development, both of which were 100% completely fake, which is confirmed by ex mods, and also lied about paying CMC to fast track project listing.\\n\\nMany mods have joined, and left when they realised it was all a scam, but some have stayed, these are just some of the current members of his crypto scam ring.\\n\\n- Barry Hayward or James Hayward - Preston, England\\n- Susan Quirk or Su Quirk (Barry's partner) - Preston, England\\n- Peter Ohanyan (Mr Live) - USA\\n- Gary Stringer (Gary) - London, England\\n- Olusa Tobi Macduff (Macduff) - Nigeria\\n- Jan Arve Hustad (Loke Bris) - Averøy, Norway\\n- Yelsew Doublep (Yelsew) - Amsterdam\\n\\nPeter Ohanyan is also a well know scammer within the crypto space and is responsible for countless Ponzi schemes and scams.\\n\\nBarry Hayward and his partner Su Quirk live a VIP lifestyle, driving around in an Aston Martin DBX, 1st class flights abroad, Mexico, France, Monte Carlo, Scandinavia, private yacht charters, VIP tickets to Formula 1 races, private helicopter charters to F1 races, helicopter flights over Dubai, Disney trips, meet and greet A list celebrities, sports cars, cosmetic surgery and breast augmentation for his partner, designer clothes, shoes and jewelry for his partner and daughter. He achieves all of this without a job, it's all paid for by the money stolen from investors.\\n\\nThere are voice clips of him making threats, boasting about his friendship's with murderers and drug dealers, who he was going to send to houses to sort people out. He's previously been wanted by police for serious assault on a woman, along with many other crimes which he was charged with, including credit card theft and obtaining IT equipment and failing to pay.\\n\\nI urge anyone affected by any of these scams to get in touch with the police and Actionfraud UK and file a report against him and his team. \\xa0\\n\\nPlease PM me for further information.\", 'comments': []}, {'title': 'Spain Trip Review', 'subreddit': 'travel', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/rfkkjq/spain_trip_review/', 'selftext': 'This is very long but hopefully some of it is useful for anyone taking a future trip to Madrid or Barcelona!\\n\\n1. Pickpocketing Barcelona: While walking, I felt a hand on my waist like they were checking to see if my pocket had anything, it was so quick and it took a second to register, but I had nothing in my pocket. I felt very safe walking around, granted I only went to Las Ramblas once for a restaurant. I stayed mostly in the Gothic Quarter/Born district. While walking through crowds and in metro stations, I kept my purse in front of me and my hand on my purse. Definitely spotted some suspicious people but never felt unsafe.\\n\\n2. Pickpocketing Madrid: very safe as well, I did witness the “bracelet scam” where a guy hands someone a bracelet and then won’t take it back and you end up having to pay him. Busier areas I was more cautious but walking around the streets felt completely safe. \\n\\n3. Don’t bring money to exchange, my travel partner did and she got ripped off. I knew this was a bad idea and opted for using an ATM. Be sure to select euros for every purchase and let your bank do the conversion! \\n\\n4. Arrive EARLY for the train. It isn’t like the metro where you can run in and hop on. They leave on time. Security is a breeze but finding which platform you need to get to requires a few minutes. Learned the hard way when we missed our train from Madrid to Barcelona and had to buy a much more expensive ticket! \\n\\n5. In Barcelona, I was surprised by the amount of Spanish I heard being spoken between employees. I was expecting to hear a lot more Catalan than I did. Not that this matters, just in case you’re wondering. \\n\\n6. Get to the Madrid airport EARLY!!! Like 3 hours early. We got there 2 hours early and almost missed our flight. We had 4 checkpoints to go through- check in desk, security, passport check, and check in at the gate. \\n\\n7. As a decent Spanish speaker, I would always start off speaking in Spanish. Sometimes they would switch to English, sometimes they wouldn’t. Which I was fine with. My travel partner knows no Spanish and we often wondered how well she would have gotten around if I wasn’t there. This was more the case in Madrid than Barcelona. \\n\\n8. People were much friendlier to us in Barcelona than Madrid. Just our personal experience. Everyone in Barcelona was SO nice and we met so many great people. \\n\\n9. Barcelona and Madrid really are walkable. We hardly took the metro since everything was less than a mile from our Airbnb except Park Guell and Sagrada Familia and the airports and main train station.\\n\\n10. No public bathrooms and train station bathrooms you have to pay a euro. \\n\\n11. When entering/exiting metro train- you have to pull a lever or press a button for doors to open. They do not open automatically. \\n\\n12. Restaurants- a lot of my research said restaurant staff are very blunt and not overly friendly. That’s exactly what I experienced and I loved it. They were quick to take our order and bring our food and drink. They weren’t rude just not overly friendly which is fine by me. You have to hunt them down for the check though, they don’t bring it unless you ask for it. \\n\\n13. Tipping- no need, don’t do it. Leave a few coins if you pay in cash but otherwise, it is tip free. We did tip our tour guides 10€ a piece because we weren’t sure what was acceptable. But it seemed to be fine. \\n\\n\\n*Tours/Day trips/Places I visited:\\n\\n1. Sagrada Familia- tour through them wasn’t worth it. I read most of the information she told us beforehand. Absolutely worth visiting, so breath taking and a marvel to see.\\n\\n2. Park Guell- very cool to see, especially at sunset. Lots of souvenir shops outside of it with decent prices. Bit of a walk to get to transportation and everyone was trying to find a taxi so we ended up taking the bus. \\n\\n3. Girona- no tour needed, very easy to get to by train, googled GoT locations and found them easily by walking around. Wear comfortable shoes it is so hilly! We walked SO much. You can easily walk from the train station to the main area of Girona- follow all the other people walking. Did half a day there, had lunch, then headed back on the train. Very easy to do. \\n\\n4. Montserrat- LOVED our tour guide. If you want the name, let me know. Definitely worth taking a small group tour and being driven up there then shown around. Got back into Barcelona around 2, just in time for lunch! Absolutely worth visiting. Don’t buy the vacuum sealed cheesecake from the vendor outside, it did not last on my travel home like she promised, lol. But do buy the almonds coated in honey and sesame! Yum!\\n\\n5. Free walking tour in Madrid was amazing. Our guide was hilarious and it was a wonderful history tour. If you want the name, let me know.\\n\\n6. Royal Palace- at the time there was no English tour offered. I would have loved to have taken it as I felt I missed so much by not knowing the story behind each room. Visit this place! Every room is so unique and intricate. Visit on Wednesday’s for the changing of the guards, very cool to see. Try to get a spot standing by the tour entrance- between the palace and the cathedral. You’ll get the best view. \\n\\n7. Del Prado Museum- go during the free time and book online. I’ll probably get hate for saying this, but it wasn’t for me. I like more contemporary art and a lot of the art I saw there were royal portraits and religious paintings. \\n\\n*Where I stayed:\\n\\n1. Barcelona- Born district. So close to the gothic quarter and so many restaurants. 2 bed Airbnb, safe and comfortable. Not anything special inside but absolutely perfect location. Let me know if you want the listing.\\n\\n2. Madrid- Plaza Mayor. Absolutely one of my favorite Airbnb’s I have ever  stayed in! Great, centralized location and amazing view of the Plaza. 2 bedroom as well. Let me know if you want the listing.\\n\\n*Notable Bars/Restaurants\\n\\n1. Barcelona\\n\\na. Orient Express- tiny but special bar. Drinks are delivered to you on a little choo choo train. You fill out a passport of drink components and bartender creates their own concoction that come in funky glasses.\\n\\nb. Paradiso- in the top 50 bars in the world. Usually a wait outside but worth the visit for a cocktail\\n\\nc. Dux- great gin bar! Friendly bartenders\\n\\nd. La Plata- very tiny restaurant but great to try their different anchovy plates and vermouth\\n\\n2. Madrid\\n\\na. Botin- worth going to since it is the oldest restaurant in the world and you can walk around and look in the wine cellar. Food was fine.\\n\\nb. Salmon Guru- funky drinks, good music\\n\\nc. Mercado de San Miguel- super packed and super overpriced. But it is good to try a variety of food\\n\\nd. Los Secretos de Lola- this restaurant is every girl’s dream. Cute fairies and gnome décor and you can sit at a table with a teddy bear as a guest. \\n\\ne. Cava Baja- this is a street with lots of tapas places to walk up and down and sample.\\n\\nf. Quinto Elemento- this restaurant is stunning! Look it up on Insta! Wow.', 'comments': ['Lovely write-up!

And if you see me wandering the streets of Madrid or Barcelona, don't hesitate to say hola!\", \"Also, I stayed in the Gracia neighborhood in Barcelona. A colleague grew up in Spain and recommended it instead of the usual tourist districts because he told me it would give me a better feel of how locals lived. Gracia was its own little village for many years and it still retains a somewhat different identity from the rest of the city. It has quiet squares, mom-and-pop shops, artists, and local clothing designers. I didn't want to buy too much stuff given luggage weight limits but it was shocking to see locally-designed/ manufactured clothing on the order of tens (not hundreds) of US dollars. A section abuts Parc Guell and the main street/ subway stops. \\n\\nHere's one person's write-up:\\n\\n[https://www.neverendingvoyage.com/gracia-barcelona-guide/](https://www.neverendingvoyage.com/gracia-barcelona-guide/)\", 'Agree about the Prado in Madrid; a very \"grand empire\" focus to their art. Was there over Thanksgiving, the 2 museums in Retiro Park were modern art (Vivian Suter and Kidlat Tahimik) and free. Highly recommended, plus the park is quite lovely, great place to spend a nice day.']}, {'title': 'A compilation of all the fake bios on twitch chat', 'subreddit': 'DotA2', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/q52y2j/a_compilation_of_all_the_fake_bios_on_twitch_chat/', 'selftext': 'Since these are sending me to heaven, I figured I\\'d try to compile the most re-used ones.

By Andrés Arellano Báez  \\n>  \\n>**N**assim Nicholas Taleb abandoned anonymity since the launch of his book \"The Black Swan\". In an interview to promote the text with Charlie Rose, the author shared that \"a stockbroker on Wall Street may have no more predictive capacity than a cab driver\" about his market. And he spoke about the matter from experience, as it was precisely in that mythical place where his first job would be located. For decades, the humans inhabiting that corner of Manhattan made the world believe that Taleb\\'s ideas were ridiculous: they boasted that they were wizards capable of navigating the turbulent waters of the financial world thanks to their vast knowledge. And the story seemed credible; until a group of uneducated citizens beat them in a billion-dollar game, on their terms and conditions, and sank many of those proud boatmen.  \\n>  \\n>There is always wisdom to be found in history. According to investor Dylan Ratigan, a connoisseur of the US market like few others and author of \"Greedy Bastards\", George W. Bush\\'s attempts to privatize Social Security in the United States must be framed in the context of the ongoing desire, mainly by Wall Street, to convince the small investor to become a stock market player. The desire of the sharks of the financial world, always hungry to expand their business, made them see those citizens without significant monetary resources as weak prey that, once they managed to unite, would become truly juicy portions. But the bait failed to catch the victims and the public\\'s disconnect with the world of finance remained intact. That is, until one company hit upon the root of the problem: the interface. Ratigan\\'s words on the matter are illuminating: \"A new investor would come to the market and find an interface that looked as complicated as driving a 747. The appearance of Robinhood, presenting a platform apparently developed under the slogan \"investments for dummies\", which also did not charge commissions to its users, attracted and convinced millions to participate.  \\n>  \\n>In August 2019, Mexico\\'s El Financiero accidentally stumbled upon a story that would grow into an unpredictably mind-blowing one. In an article focused on how the next big financial stratospheric leap would be in South Korea and some small companies, the U.S. newspaper revealed that Michael \"Burry asked Gamestop, a video game retailer, and Tailored Brands, a men\\'s clothing retailer,\" to buy back all of his shares. At the time, the investor turned celebrity after being played by Christian Bale in \"The Big Short\", owned 5.3% of the video game retailer through his hedge fund Scion Asset Management, which he acquired at a price per share of between 2 and 4.2 dollars, according to the media.  \\n>  \\n>Although Barry had become a major player on Wall Street, he consecrated his title by betting on two unpredictable crashes, both in markets certified as AAA by the major rating agencies: the dot. com debacle in 2001 and the global financial crisis caused by the loss on mortgage-backed securities securitized as credit default swaps in 2007, in Gamestop\\'s case it seems that it was not its ability to foresee the future that led to its success, but its already earned influence in the markets that was the reason for having a third winning bet. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. As soon as the guru took a position in Gamestop, another major investor, Ryan Cohen, made a significant purchase of the stock, and then a massive number of smaller investors, many of them fans of the brand and initiated into the stock market thanks to Robinhood, followed in his footsteps. One of them deserves special mention: Keith Gill, known online as \"DeepF-ingValue\". A crazy and unprecedented story was beginning to unfold.  \\n>  \\n>Nothing indicates that Burry foresaw the debacle. According to Business Insider, after taking a strong position in Gamestop, the financier promoted far-reaching changes in the company. His bet seems to have been to transform the company\\'s fundamentals, price the stock and generate a large profit over the long term. He had already stated his vision of \"investing heavily in undervalued and overlooked stocks\", as \"asset managers have orphaned lower-value stocks globally\". All of the new investors, many of them brand lovers, wanted the same thing as the financial guru. Gill confessed to The Wall Street Journal that \"people were doing a quick take, saying Gamestop was the next Blockbuster,\" referring to another chain fallen from grace. \"It seemed like a lot of people just weren\\'t digging deeper,\" the interviewee continued. It was a gross misclassification of opportunity.\" All the small investors, led by Gill, saw Gamestop as a company that would have a second life.  \\n>  \\n>But along came the pandemic that would change everything, and everything would go haywire, laying the groundwork for what would be a truly unprecedented IPO. Gamestop is a corporation whose heart is located in shopping malls. It is their space par excellence. With the spread of Covid-19 closing each one of them, the future of the business was projected to be threatened. The biggest and most traditional players in the market became aware of the problems created by the new context and acted accordingly, starting a bet against the company: short operations whose element of relevance is only one: the big funds decided to invest millions of dollars waiting for the share price to fall. They would make a profit if the price of the purchased share fell over time. And the global outlook created an ideal scenario for such a financial move. From their perspective, the analysis was correct and the numbers proved to be right.  \\n>  \\n>The action taken by hedge funds is known in the market as short selling. The funds borrow a share from someone and are obliged to return it to its owner on a certain date. The borrowed share is sold at the market price to a third party with whom, in turn, they are obliged to buy it back within a certain period of time. The fund that lent the share to sell it to a third party expects the price of the security to fall, so that when it purchases it again it can do so at a cheaper price, generating a profit. If he sells it at 100 and buys it back at 50, well....  \\n>  \\n>The person who buys the stock to sell it later, expects the price of the stock to go up, of course, selling it at a higher price than he bought it. The problem with short trading, for the fund borrowing the stock, is that you can make a limited amount, but you can lose an infinite amount of money. If the fund sells the stock for 100 and it loses all of its value, when it buys it back from the original owner, it will pay zero for it, producing a gain of 100. But, if the stock he lent and sold at 100, at the time he has to buy it back is not worth zero or a hundred, but is valued at 50,000, then he is obliged to pay 50,000 for it, turning his transaction into a loss of 49,900.  \\n>  \\n>And, when some of the big names on Wall Street began to bet short, to look for Gamestop\\'s failure, to go against a company loved by many, the gates of hell opened. \"It was like a war,\" one of the investors in Gamespot told El Diario.es. Bad news would come out, like the coronavirus was going to wipe out Gamestop, and people would put more money in. It was a class war. And so it was: bankers were fighting to drive the stock price down, Reedit users were willing to do anything to drive it up. \"We will be able to be mentally retarded longer than the vulture funds will be able to be profitable,\" commented one of the warriors at Wallstreetbets, the Reedit space where the men and women who fought this battle crowded in. And in the end, they triumphed, raising the price to unpredictable numbers. That is, it could not be otherwise, until the Manhattan bankers, the center of neoliberal ideology, the main space from where an ideological battle to the death against government intervention in the economy has been waged the strongest, the king of the free market, decided to turn to Daddy State to save him from the guillotine. Here the story becomes fascinating.  \\n>  \\n>Given that the people Wall Street was fighting against were not rational, did not act on market logic, did not care about losing money, they were forced into draconian measures to stop the bleeding. The fund that had lost the most money in this gamble was called Melvin Capital. Its major commercial competitor is called Citadel. The latter decided to take advantage of the situation and acquire the former. Once this purchase was made, Citadel, whose CEO is Kenneth Griffin, the highest paid executive in the world (1.7 billion USD per year), took possession of all these bets. Why would a financial company carry out an operation that would put it in a business with the proven capacity to bleed its finances to death? The only logical reason, the only possible answer, the only plausible explanation is that Citadel knew how to suture the wound causing the bleeding.  \\n>  \\n>Speaking fess are the fees paid by companies to certain professionals of notorious trajectory in the United States to dictate speeches for their employees, seeking to enrich and enlighten their workers, irradiating them with the wisdom contained in notable names. Janet Yellen, current Secretary of the Treasury in the United States, is an academic with an unbeatable track record. She has received almost every award in her career, and each of them has been awarded with justice. The Nobel Prize that has eluded her will surely come her way soon. But unless she has discovered how to solve all the ills of humanity through economics and has organized a talk to explain her findings, there is no justification whatsoever for the $800,000 received last December from Citadel for a few words. On the other hand, such a staggering amount is understandable when, as Dylan Ratigan explains, it echoes the theory that speaking fess are awarded not for speaking, for the speech, but for granting direct access to the person hired. By December of last year, it was certain that Yellen would be the next Treasury Secretary under the Biden administration.  \\n>  \\n>Although it is nothing more than speculation, rather the worst kept secret, it serves to clarify why Robinhood, the platform that had convinced millions of citizens to invest their money in the market, that had made life easier for those who wanted to buy stocks and the tool used by small investors against Wall Street, in an unprecedented decision allowed its users to close positions in Gamestop, but prohibited the purchase of the stock. It did not freeze the transaction of the stock traded as GME, it only prohibited its acquisition. If a stock can only be liquidated, it will see its price decrease, something that only benefited Citadel, a company that had acquired Melvin Capital, which had paid $800,000 to Yellen for speeches and who, this is the most relevant of all, the clue that deciphers the crime: it is the best client of the Robinhood platform.  \\n>  \\n>Robinhood is unable to buy or sell shares directly. Legally this is the case. Hence its need to work with \"market makers\", companies that the legal framework does give them that power. Their best-established partnership for this operation is with Citadel. A \"market maker\" is a type of organization that, because of its particularities, requires a lot of information about how trends move. A \"market maker\" needs to anticipate events in order to perform its function. A short sale requires anticipating whether a stock is going to go down or up in price, for example. When Robinhood asks Citadel to buy or sell millions of shares for its investors, it is giving them the information they need. And in order for Robinhood to use Citadel\\'s services and not another \"market maker,\" Citadel pays a small commission for each transaction. That\\'s why this platform, which does not charge its users a commission for buying and selling stocks, is a billionaire. That commission is its business. \"When they don\\'t charge you for a service, it\\'s because you are the product,\" says the wise popular adage.  \\n>  \\n>Any technical explanation given by Vladimir Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, justifying his reasons for having stopped the purchase of a share is simply ridiculous in light of the analysis made by Ratigan: \"From a legal point of view,\" explained the businessman, \"the only organization that has the authority to stop the purchase and sale of a share, let alone the ridiculousness of stopping one part of the transaction and not the other, is the New York Stock Exchange\". He complements, \"the only valid reason to stop the purchase and sale of a stock is for the leakage of relevant information that impacts the market or knowledge of imminent fraud\". The examples cited in his peroration - Enron and Worldcom - are telling enough to show this was not the case. \"A company has no authority to stop a stock from trading,\" Ratigan says, \"much less prevent it from being bought while prohibiting it from being sold. That act is clear market manipulation.\" And therein lies written, in that sentence, the epitaph of Wall Street.  \\n>  \\n>From now on, in any debate where one of the parties dares to cite the benefits of the free market and the superiority of such a system, they risk being ridiculed by their opponent with just one word: \"Gamestop\". Time will tell whether or not Yellen acted in favor of her clients; but intervention in the sacrosanct market did occur. They have even gone further. Witnessing NASDAQ CEO Adena Friedman on live television, without blushing, calling for the installation of regulations in the market is to witness the true essence of an ideology that was nothing more than a scam coming to light. The US financial sector as a whole, never spared resources and financed for decades all kinds of propaganda about the damage caused by regulations, how inefficient they are, how contrary to the wisdom of the market their very existence was. Today they are begging for their declared enemy to not only exist, but to act, to be present and intervene to protect them on their own playing field.  \\n>  \\n>And the fear is justified. Reedit investors did not topple Wall Street. But the Wall Street representative against whom they fought to the death, that one they did defeat. He went bankrupt. For the first time in its history, the mecca of the financial world found a real opponent. Competition in the U.S. stock market sector was always between equals and the losses of one were the gains of another of his own. Never again. \"Occupy Wall Street\", the battle slogan of the 2008 victims camping out in Zuccoti Park, in front of the majestic offices of the big players in the stock market sector, reached a whole new level when they knocked down the walls protecting their empire, unleashing the entry of outsiders to occupy their business. When the war for GME began, Wallstreetbets had 3 million forum followers. Today there are 8 million. More citizens, more money, more power. The stakes are on the table and now anything can happen.', 'comments': []}, {'title': 'List of Mods for INCREASED DIFFICULTY. Any Xcom fans?

[if launching manually what you wanna see is Larian Launcher]\\n\\nTo be ABSOLUTELY sure you won\\'t trigger the update Launch the game exclusively through BG3 Mod Manager. If you don\\'t wanna get burned, and you wanna track playtime, achievements etc, you can re-launch Steam as soon as the game is running (or Larian Launcher is up, depending on your settings) - Thx to Siael - a Mod Author and BG3SE Guru from BG3 Modding community /  BG3 Community Discord for the info I lacked.\\n\\n2. If you are not using BG3MM and also it looks like playtime on steam is not updated when you launch trough BG3MM this is what I used to do,  (because I had incident where a mix of AutoHotKey and PowerShell scripts was set up to re-launch my game in the case of crash - I wasn\\'t at home, game crashed, and SOMEHOW, it triggered an update to Patch 4, which screwed me out of giving Noblestalk to both ShadowHeart and Halfling Vendor in Myconid colony Derryth Bonecloak - which was possible in patch 3 if you spawned additional Noblestalk using CheatEngine which I did, - and I tested it, but I delayed it because I didn\\'t want vendor to scram to Baldur\\'s Gate with Noblestalk and set up shop there - because I was still in process of robbing her blind out of Alchemy ingredients.\\n\\nBefore I started using mod manager, I would start up steam, wait until the Play icon for BG3 is green, disable network adapter. start the game trough shortcut to BG3.exe (simply create a shortcut and dump it on desktop or in my case in start menu), start BG3.exe, and you can re -enable your network adapter as soon as Larian launcher pops up and Bob\\'s your uncle.). 99%  of time there\\'s no need for this, but I got burnt and didn\\'t wanna bother with rollback so I\\'m not lazy  to do it every time now, but mod manager will prevent update from starting\\n\\n***\\n**INCREASED DIFFICULTY MODS**\\n***\\n[Tactician Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/661)\\n\\n^This ^mod ^aims ^to ^increase ^or ^[decrease] ^the ^difficulty ^of ^the ^game, ^for ^use ^with ^mods ^like ^Party ^Limits ^Begone. ^With ^the ^new ^Modular ^design ^you ^can ^choose ^from ^an ^array ^of ^health ^boost ^and ^stat ^boost ^to ^add ^to ^your ^Tactician ^Mode ^play-though, ^with ^easily ^editable ^files, ^if ^I ^don\\'t ^have ^a ^preset ^that ^fits ^your ^needs.\\n\\n[Lethal AI Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1465)\\n\\n^Improves ^the ^AI ^of ^the ^enemies. ^Makes ^them ^much ^smarter\\n\\n[Immersive AI](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1835)^*\\n\\n^Immersive ^AI ^is ^a ^complete ^rewrite ^of ^BG3’s ^combat ^AI ^to ^make ^it ^more ^varied, ^immersive ^and ^fun ^to ^play.\\n^^* ^**NOTE:** ^Sounds ^promising, ^but ^not ^tested ^[yet] ^by ^me, ^Mod ^has ^pretty ^extensive ^documentation, ^available ^on ^the ^mod ^page ^or ^^[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tyBPQzqpEZcO72g_FcHcghHnuFq5FNORPMs6g4QnJJY/edit#heading=h.7kg4m8ye8aie),\\n\\n ^Description ^also ^states ^the ^following: ^V2 ^is ^finally ^here ^featuring ^massive ^changes ^to ^almost ^every ^AI ^in ^the ^game ^as ^well ^as ^hundreds ^of ^new ^AI.\\n\\n^I ^recommend ^you ^use ^Immersive ^AI ^alone ^without ^any ^other ^AI ^mods ^as ^it ^is ^far ^superior ^to ^all ^other ^AI ^mods.\\n^I ^have ^included ^a ^compatibility ^patch ^for ^use ^with ^Lethal ^AI ^but ^I ^recommend ^you ^use ^only ^Immersive ^AI ^as ^you ^do ^not ^need ^Lethal ^AI ^in ^all ^honesty ^if ^you ^are ^using ^my ^mod.\\n\\n\\n^^* ^^**NOTE:** ^^I ^^will ^^add ^^updates ^^as ^^I ^^test ^^the ^^mod, ^^this ^^is ^^one ^^of ^^those ^^at ^^the ^^top ^^5 ^^in ^^testing ^^queue\\n\\n[Orin\\'s True Bossfight](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4107)\\n\\n^Orin\\'s ^boss ^fight ^made ^proper. ^See ^description. ^SPOILER ^WARNING ^- ^Act ^3\\n\\nOverview:\\n^Orin\\'s ^boss ^fight ^has ^unused ^potential. ^You ^confront ^her ^in ^Slayer ^form, ^but ^when ^you ^defeat ^her, ^she\\'s ^just ^dead, ^while ^transformations ^usually ^revert ^the ^user ^to ^normal ^state ^when ^defeated.\\n\\n^This ^mod ^doest ^just ^that ^to ^Orin. ^When ^ou ^beat ^the ^Slayer ^form, ^you ^still ^got ^to ^fight ^Orin\\'s ^humanoid ^form. ^Makes ^it ^for ^a ^more ^interesting ^boss ^fight ^in ^two ^phases, ^as ^for ^the ^other ^Netherstones ^holders.\\n\\n^Plus, ^now ^there\\'s ^an ^actual ^benefit ^of ^playing ^a ^bad ^Dark ^Urge ^who ^becomes ^Chosen ^of ^Bhaal, ^as ^this ^prevents ^Orin ^from ^getting ^her ^Slayer ^form, ^thus ^making ^her ^actually ^weaker. \\n\\n\\n\\n[Death March -

They were instructed by Hayward to obtain new mobile SIM cards and new identities on telegram, delete old telegram groups, abandon investors and move on to the next scam. We obtained screenshots of leaked private admin chats which can prove this.\\nHayward has a history of slow rug pulls and liquidy theft, and is known for disappearing with presale earnings after failing to launch projects.\\nHe has blamed the past projects failures on investors selling, bots, FUD, members of the team stealing, marketing companies stealing, lied about spending money on magazine and game development, both of which were 100% completely fake, which is confirmed by ex mods, and also lied about paying CMC to fast track project listing.\\n\\nMany mods have joined, and left when they realised it was all a scam, but some have stayed, these are just some of the current members of his crypto scam ring.\\n\\n- Barry Hayward or James Hayward - Preston, England\\n- Susan Quirk or Su Quirk (Barry's partner) - Preston, England\\n- Peter Ohanyan (Mr Live) - USA\\n- Gary Stringer (Gary) - London, England\\n- Olusa Tobi Macduff (Macduff) - Nigeria\\n- Jan Arve Hustad (Loke Bris) - Averøy, Norway\\n- Yelsew Doublep (Yelsew) - Amsterdam\\n\\nPeter Ohanyan is also a well know scammer within the crypto space and is responsible for countless Ponzi schemes and scams.\\n\\nBarry Hayward and his partner Su Quirk live a VIP lifestyle, driving around in an Aston Martin DBX, 1st class flights abroad, Mexico, France, Monte Carlo, Scandinavia, private yacht charters, VIP tickets to Formula 1 races, private helicopter charters to F1 races, helicopter flights over Dubai, Disney trips, meet and greet A list celebrities, sports cars, cosmetic surgery and breast augmentation for his partner, designer clothes, shoes and jewelry for his partner and daughter. He achieves all of this without a job, it's all paid for by the money stolen from investors.\\n\\nThere are voice clips of him making threats, boasting about his friendship's with murderers and drug dealers, who he was going to send to houses to sort people out. He's previously been wanted by police for serious assault on a woman, along with many other crimes which he was charged with, including credit card theft and obtaining IT equipment and failing to pay.\\n\\nI urge anyone affected by any of these scams to get in touch with the police and Actionfraud UK and file a report against him and his team. \\xa0\\n\\nPlease PM me for further information.\", 'comments': []}, {'title': 'Spain Trip Review', 'subreddit': 'travel', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/rfkkjq/spain_trip_review/', 'selftext': 'This is very long but hopefully some of it is useful for anyone taking a future trip to Madrid or Barcelona!\\n\\n1. Pickpocketing Barcelona: While walking, I felt a hand on my waist like they were checking to see if my pocket had anything, it was so quick and it took a second to register, but I had nothing in my pocket. I felt very safe walking around, granted I only went to Las Ramblas once for a restaurant. I stayed mostly in the Gothic Quarter/Born district. While walking through crowds and in metro stations, I kept my purse in front of me and my hand on my purse. Definitely spotted some suspicious people but never felt unsafe.\\n\\n2. Pickpocketing Madrid: very safe as well, I did witness the “bracelet scam” where a guy hands someone a bracelet and then won’t take it back and you end up having to pay him. Busier areas I was more cautious but walking around the streets felt completely safe. \\n\\n3. Don’t bring money to exchange, my travel partner did and she got ripped off. I knew this was a bad idea and opted for using an ATM. Be sure to select euros for every purchase and let your bank do the conversion! \\n\\n4. Arrive EARLY for the train. It isn’t like the metro where you can run in and hop on. They leave on time. Security is a breeze but finding which platform you need to get to requires a few minutes. Learned the hard way when we missed our train from Madrid to Barcelona and had to buy a much more expensive ticket! \\n\\n5. In Barcelona, I was surprised by the amount of Spanish I heard being spoken between employees. I was expecting to hear a lot more Catalan than I did. Not that this matters, just in case you’re wondering. \\n\\n6. Get to the Madrid airport EARLY!!! Like 3 hours early. We got there 2 hours early and almost missed our flight. We had 4 checkpoints to go through- check in desk, security, passport check, and check in at the gate. \\n\\n7. As a decent Spanish speaker, I would always start off speaking in Spanish. Sometimes they would switch to English, sometimes they wouldn’t. Which I was fine with. My travel partner knows no Spanish and we often wondered how well she would have gotten around if I wasn’t there. This was more the case in Madrid than Barcelona. \\n\\n8. People were much friendlier to us in Barcelona than Madrid. Just our personal experience. Everyone in Barcelona was SO nice and we met so many great people. \\n\\n9. Barcelona and Madrid really are walkable. We hardly took the metro since everything was less than a mile from our Airbnb except Park Guell and Sagrada Familia and the airports and main train station.\\n\\n10. No public bathrooms and train station bathrooms you have to pay a euro. \\n\\n11. When entering/exiting metro train- you have to pull a lever or press a button for doors to open. They do not open automatically. \\n\\n12. Restaurants- a lot of my research said restaurant staff are very blunt and not overly friendly. That’s exactly what I experienced and I loved it. They were quick to take our order and bring our food and drink. They weren’t rude just not overly friendly which is fine by me. You have to hunt them down for the check though, they don’t bring it unless you ask for it. \\n\\n13. Tipping- no need, don’t do it. Leave a few coins if you pay in cash but otherwise, it is tip free. We did tip our tour guides 10€ a piece because we weren’t sure what was acceptable. But it seemed to be fine. \\n\\n\\n*Tours/Day trips/Places I visited:\\n\\n1. Sagrada Familia- tour through them wasn’t worth it. I read most of the information she told us beforehand. Absolutely worth visiting, so breath taking and a marvel to see.\\n\\n2. Park Guell- very cool to see, especially at sunset. Lots of souvenir shops outside of it with decent prices. Bit of a walk to get to transportation and everyone was trying to find a taxi so we ended up taking the bus. \\n\\n3. Girona- no tour needed, very easy to get to by train, googled GoT locations and found them easily by walking around. Wear comfortable shoes it is so hilly! We walked SO much. You can easily walk from the train station to the main area of Girona- follow all the other people walking. Did half a day there, had lunch, then headed back on the train. Very easy to do. \\n\\n4. Montserrat- LOVED our tour guide. If you want the name, let me know. Definitely worth taking a small group tour and being driven up there then shown around. Got back into Barcelona around 2, just in time for lunch! Absolutely worth visiting. Don’t buy the vacuum sealed cheesecake from the vendor outside, it did not last on my travel home like she promised, lol. But do buy the almonds coated in honey and sesame! Yum!\\n\\n5. Free walking tour in Madrid was amazing. Our guide was hilarious and it was a wonderful history tour. If you want the name, let me know.\\n\\n6. Royal Palace- at the time there was no English tour offered. I would have loved to have taken it as I felt I missed so much by not knowing the story behind each room. Visit this place! Every room is so unique and intricate. Visit on Wednesday’s for the changing of the guards, very cool to see. Try to get a spot standing by the tour entrance- between the palace and the cathedral. You’ll get the best view. \\n\\n7. Del Prado Museum- go during the free time and book online. I’ll probably get hate for saying this, but it wasn’t for me. I like more contemporary art and a lot of the art I saw there were royal portraits and religious paintings. \\n\\n*Where I stayed:\\n\\n1. Barcelona- Born district. So close to the gothic quarter and so many restaurants. 2 bed Airbnb, safe and comfortable. Not anything special inside but absolutely perfect location. Let me know if you want the listing.\\n\\n2. Madrid- Plaza Mayor. Absolutely one of my favorite Airbnb’s I have ever  stayed in! Great, centralized location and amazing view of the Plaza. 2 bedroom as well. Let me know if you want the listing.\\n\\n*Notable Bars/Restaurants\\n\\n1. Barcelona\\n\\na. Orient Express- tiny but special bar. Drinks are delivered to you on a little choo choo train. You fill out a passport of drink components and bartender creates their own concoction that come in funky glasses.\\n\\nb. Paradiso- in the top 50 bars in the world. Usually a wait outside but worth the visit for a cocktail\\n\\nc. Dux- great gin bar! Friendly bartenders\\n\\nd. La Plata- very tiny restaurant but great to try their different anchovy plates and vermouth\\n\\n2. Madrid\\n\\na. Botin- worth going to since it is the oldest restaurant in the world and you can walk around and look in the wine cellar. Food was fine.\\n\\nb. Salmon Guru- funky drinks, good music\\n\\nc. Mercado de San Miguel- super packed and super overpriced. But it is good to try a variety of food\\n\\nd. Los Secretos de Lola- this restaurant is every girl’s dream. Cute fairies and gnome décor and you can sit at a table with a teddy bear as a guest. \\n\\ne. Cava Baja- this is a street with lots of tapas places to walk up and down and sample.\\n\\nf. Quinto Elemento- this restaurant is stunning! Look it up on Insta! Wow.', 'comments': ['Lovely write-up!

A colleague grew up in Spain and recommended it instead of the usual tourist districts because he told me it would give me a better feel of how locals lived. Gracia was its own little village for many years and it still retains a somewhat different identity from the rest of the city. It has quiet squares, mom-and-pop shops, artists, and local clothing designers. I didn't want to buy too much stuff given luggage weight limits but it was shocking to see locally-designed/ manufactured clothing on the order of tens (not hundreds) of US dollars. A section abuts Parc Guell and the main street/ subway stops. \\n\\nHere's one person's write-up:\\n\\n[https://www.neverendingvoyage.com/gracia-barcelona-guide/](https://www.neverendingvoyage.com/gracia-barcelona-guide/)\", 'Agree about the Prado in Madrid; a very \"grand empire\" focus to their art. Was there over Thanksgiving, the 2 museums in Retiro Park were modern art (Vivian Suter and Kidlat Tahimik) and free. Highly recommended, plus the park is quite lovely, great place to spend a nice day.']}, {'title': 'A compilation of all the fake bios on twitch chat', 'subreddit': 'DotA2', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/q52y2j/a_compilation_of_all_the_fake_bios_on_twitch_chat/', 'selftext': 'Since these are sending me to heaven, I figured I\\'d try to compile the most re-used ones.

By Andrés Arellano Báez  \\n>  \\n>**N**assim Nicholas Taleb abandoned anonymity since the launch of his book \"The Black Swan\". In an interview to promote the text with Charlie Rose, the author shared that \"a stockbroker on Wall Street may have no more predictive capacity than a cab driver\" about his market. And he spoke about the matter from experience, as it was precisely in that mythical place where his first job would be located. For decades, the humans inhabiting that corner of Manhattan made the world believe that Taleb\\'s ideas were ridiculous: they boasted that they were wizards capable of navigating the turbulent waters of the financial world thanks to their vast knowledge. And the story seemed credible; until a group of uneducated citizens beat them in a billion-dollar game, on their terms and conditions, and sank many of those proud boatmen.  \\n>  \\n>There is always wisdom to be found in history. According to investor Dylan Ratigan, a connoisseur of the US market like few others and author of \"Greedy Bastards\", George W. Bush\\'s attempts to privatize Social Security in the United States must be framed in the context of the ongoing desire, mainly by Wall Street, to convince the small investor to become a stock market player. The desire of the sharks of the financial world, always hungry to expand their business, made them see those citizens without significant monetary resources as weak prey that, once they managed to unite, would become truly juicy portions. But the bait failed to catch the victims and the public\\'s disconnect with the world of finance remained intact. That is, until one company hit upon the root of the problem: the interface. Ratigan\\'s words on the matter are illuminating: \"A new investor would come to the market and find an interface that looked as complicated as driving a 747. The appearance of Robinhood, presenting a platform apparently developed under the slogan \"investments for dummies\", which also did not charge commissions to its users, attracted and convinced millions to participate.  \\n>  \\n>In August 2019, Mexico\\'s El Financiero accidentally stumbled upon a story that would grow into an unpredictably mind-blowing one. In an article focused on how the next big financial stratospheric leap would be in South Korea and some small companies, the U.S. newspaper revealed that Michael \"Burry asked Gamestop, a video game retailer, and Tailored Brands, a men\\'s clothing retailer,\" to buy back all of his shares. At the time, the investor turned celebrity after being played by Christian Bale in \"The Big Short\", owned 5.3% of the video game retailer through his hedge fund Scion Asset Management, which he acquired at a price per share of between 2 and 4.2 dollars, according to the media.  \\n>  \\n>Although Barry had become a major player on Wall Street, he consecrated his title by betting on two unpredictable crashes, both in markets certified as AAA by the major rating agencies: the dot. com debacle in 2001 and the global financial crisis caused by the loss on mortgage-backed securities securitized as credit default swaps in 2007, in Gamestop\\'s case it seems that it was not its ability to foresee the future that led to its success, but its already earned influence in the markets that was the reason for having a third winning bet. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. As soon as the guru took a position in Gamestop, another major investor, Ryan Cohen, made a significant purchase of the stock, and then a massive number of smaller investors, many of them fans of the brand and initiated into the stock market thanks to Robinhood, followed in his footsteps. One of them deserves special mention: Keith Gill, known online as \"DeepF-ingValue\". A crazy and unprecedented story was beginning to unfold.  \\n>  \\n>Nothing indicates that Burry foresaw the debacle. According to Business Insider, after taking a strong position in Gamestop, the financier promoted far-reaching changes in the company. His bet seems to have been to transform the company\\'s fundamentals, price the stock and generate a large profit over the long term. He had already stated his vision of \"investing heavily in undervalued and overlooked stocks\", as \"asset managers have orphaned lower-value stocks globally\". All of the new investors, many of them brand lovers, wanted the same thing as the financial guru. Gill confessed to The Wall Street Journal that \"people were doing a quick take, saying Gamestop was the next Blockbuster,\" referring to another chain fallen from grace. \"It seemed like a lot of people just weren\\'t digging deeper,\" the interviewee continued. It was a gross misclassification of opportunity.\" All the small investors, led by Gill, saw Gamestop as a company that would have a second life.  \\n>  \\n>But along came the pandemic that would change everything, and everything would go haywire, laying the groundwork for what would be a truly unprecedented IPO. Gamestop is a corporation whose heart is located in shopping malls. It is their space par excellence. With the spread of Covid-19 closing each one of them, the future of the business was projected to be threatened. The biggest and most traditional players in the market became aware of the problems created by the new context and acted accordingly, starting a bet against the company: short operations whose element of relevance is only one: the big funds decided to invest millions of dollars waiting for the share price to fall. They would make a profit if the price of the purchased share fell over time. And the global outlook created an ideal scenario for such a financial move. From their perspective, the analysis was correct and the numbers proved to be right.  \\n>  \\n>The action taken by hedge funds is known in the market as short selling. The funds borrow a share from someone and are obliged to return it to its owner on a certain date. The borrowed share is sold at the market price to a third party with whom, in turn, they are obliged to buy it back within a certain period of time. The fund that lent the share to sell it to a third party expects the price of the security to fall, so that when it purchases it again it can do so at a cheaper price, generating a profit. If he sells it at 100 and buys it back at 50, well....  \\n>  \\n>The person who buys the stock to sell it later, expects the price of the stock to go up, of course, selling it at a higher price than he bought it. The problem with short trading, for the fund borrowing the stock, is that you can make a limited amount, but you can lose an infinite amount of money. If the fund sells the stock for 100 and it loses all of its value, when it buys it back from the original owner, it will pay zero for it, producing a gain of 100. But, if the stock he lent and sold at 100, at the time he has to buy it back is not worth zero or a hundred, but is valued at 50,000, then he is obliged to pay 50,000 for it, turning his transaction into a loss of 49,900.  \\n>  \\n>And, when some of the big names on Wall Street began to bet short, to look for Gamestop\\'s failure, to go against a company loved by many, the gates of hell opened. \"It was like a war,\" one of the investors in Gamespot told El Diario.es. Bad news would come out, like the coronavirus was going to wipe out Gamestop, and people would put more money in. It was a class war. And so it was: bankers were fighting to drive the stock price down, Reedit users were willing to do anything to drive it up. \"We will be able to be mentally retarded longer than the vulture funds will be able to be profitable,\" commented one of the warriors at Wallstreetbets, the Reedit space where the men and women who fought this battle crowded in. And in the end, they triumphed, raising the price to unpredictable numbers. That is, it could not be otherwise, until the Manhattan bankers, the center of neoliberal ideology, the main space from where an ideological battle to the death against government intervention in the economy has been waged the strongest, the king of the free market, decided to turn to Daddy State to save him from the guillotine. Here the story becomes fascinating.  \\n>  \\n>Given that the people Wall Street was fighting against were not rational, did not act on market logic, did not care about losing money, they were forced into draconian measures to stop the bleeding. The fund that had lost the most money in this gamble was called Melvin Capital. Its major commercial competitor is called Citadel. The latter decided to take advantage of the situation and acquire the former. Once this purchase was made, Citadel, whose CEO is Kenneth Griffin, the highest paid executive in the world (1.7 billion USD per year), took possession of all these bets. Why would a financial company carry out an operation that would put it in a business with the proven capacity to bleed its finances to death? The only logical reason, the only possible answer, the only plausible explanation is that Citadel knew how to suture the wound causing the bleeding.  \\n>  \\n>Speaking fess are the fees paid by companies to certain professionals of notorious trajectory in the United States to dictate speeches for their employees, seeking to enrich and enlighten their workers, irradiating them with the wisdom contained in notable names. Janet Yellen, current Secretary of the Treasury in the United States, is an academic with an unbeatable track record. She has received almost every award in her career, and each of them has been awarded with justice. The Nobel Prize that has eluded her will surely come her way soon. But unless she has discovered how to solve all the ills of humanity through economics and has organized a talk to explain her findings, there is no justification whatsoever for the $800,000 received last December from Citadel for a few words. On the other hand, such a staggering amount is understandable when, as Dylan Ratigan explains, it echoes the theory that speaking fess are awarded not for speaking, for the speech, but for granting direct access to the person hired. By December of last year, it was certain that Yellen would be the next Treasury Secretary under the Biden administration.  \\n>  \\n>Although it is nothing more than speculation, rather the worst kept secret, it serves to clarify why Robinhood, the platform that had convinced millions of citizens to invest their money in the market, that had made life easier for those who wanted to buy stocks and the tool used by small investors against Wall Street, in an unprecedented decision allowed its users to close positions in Gamestop, but prohibited the purchase of the stock. It did not freeze the transaction of the stock traded as GME, it only prohibited its acquisition. If a stock can only be liquidated, it will see its price decrease, something that only benefited Citadel, a company that had acquired Melvin Capital, which had paid $800,000 to Yellen for speeches and who, this is the most relevant of all, the clue that deciphers the crime: it is the best client of the Robinhood platform.  \\n>  \\n>Robinhood is unable to buy or sell shares directly. Legally this is the case. Hence its need to work with \"market makers\", companies that the legal framework does give them that power. Their best-established partnership for this operation is with Citadel. A \"market maker\" is a type of organization that, because of its particularities, requires a lot of information about how trends move. A \"market maker\" needs to anticipate events in order to perform its function. A short sale requires anticipating whether a stock is going to go down or up in price, for example. When Robinhood asks Citadel to buy or sell millions of shares for its investors, it is giving them the information they need. And in order for Robinhood to use Citadel\\'s services and not another \"market maker,\" Citadel pays a small commission for each transaction. That\\'s why this platform, which does not charge its users a commission for buying and selling stocks, is a billionaire. That commission is its business. \"When they don\\'t charge you for a service, it\\'s because you are the product,\" says the wise popular adage.  \\n>  \\n>Any technical explanation given by Vladimir Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, justifying his reasons for having stopped the purchase of a share is simply ridiculous in light of the analysis made by Ratigan: \"From a legal point of view,\" explained the businessman, \"the only organization that has the authority to stop the purchase and sale of a share, let alone the ridiculousness of stopping one part of the transaction and not the other, is the New York Stock Exchange\". He complements, \"the only valid reason to stop the purchase and sale of a stock is for the leakage of relevant information that impacts the market or knowledge of imminent fraud\". The examples cited in his peroration - Enron and Worldcom - are telling enough to show this was not the case. \"A company has no authority to stop a stock from trading,\" Ratigan says, \"much less prevent it from being bought while prohibiting it from being sold. That act is clear market manipulation.\" And therein lies written, in that sentence, the epitaph of Wall Street.  \\n>  \\n>From now on, in any debate where one of the parties dares to cite the benefits of the free market and the superiority of such a system, they risk being ridiculed by their opponent with just one word: \"Gamestop\". Time will tell whether or not Yellen acted in favor of her clients; but intervention in the sacrosanct market did occur. They have even gone further. Witnessing NASDAQ CEO Adena Friedman on live television, without blushing, calling for the installation of regulations in the market is to witness the true essence of an ideology that was nothing more than a scam coming to light. The US financial sector as a whole, never spared resources and financed for decades all kinds of propaganda about the damage caused by regulations, how inefficient they are, how contrary to the wisdom of the market their very existence was. Today they are begging for their declared enemy to not only exist, but to act, to be present and intervene to protect them on their own playing field.  \\n>  \\n>And the fear is justified. Reedit investors did not topple Wall Street. But the Wall Street representative against whom they fought to the death, that one they did defeat. He went bankrupt. For the first time in its history, the mecca of the financial world found a real opponent. Competition in the U.S. stock market sector was always between equals and the losses of one were the gains of another of his own. Never again. \"Occupy Wall Street\", the battle slogan of the 2008 victims camping out in Zuccoti Park, in front of the majestic offices of the big players in the stock market sector, reached a whole new level when they knocked down the walls protecting their empire, unleashing the entry of outsiders to occupy their business.

[if launching manually what you wanna see is Larian Launcher]\\n\\nTo be ABSOLUTELY sure you won\\'t trigger the update Launch the game exclusively through BG3 Mod Manager. If you don\\'t wanna get burned, and you wanna track playtime, achievements etc, you can re-launch Steam as soon as the game is running (or Larian Launcher is up, depending on your settings) - Thx to Siael - a Mod Author and BG3SE Guru from BG3 Modding community /  BG3 Community Discord for the info I lacked.\\n\\n2. If you are not using BG3MM and also it looks like playtime on steam is not updated when you launch trough BG3MM this is what I used to do,  (because I had incident where a mix of AutoHotKey and PowerShell scripts was set up to re-launch my game in the case of crash - I wasn\\'t at home, game crashed, and SOMEHOW, it triggered an update to Patch 4, which screwed me out of giving Noblestalk to both ShadowHeart and Halfling Vendor in Myconid colony Derryth Bonecloak - which was possible in patch 3 if you spawned additional Noblestalk using CheatEngine which I did, - and I tested it, but I delayed it because I didn\\'t want vendor to scram to Baldur\\'s Gate with Noblestalk and set up shop there - because I was still in process of robbing her blind out of Alchemy ingredients.\\n\\nBefore I started using mod manager, I would start up steam, wait until the Play icon for BG3 is green, disable network adapter. start the game trough shortcut to BG3.exe (simply create a shortcut and dump it on desktop or in my case in start menu), start BG3.exe, and you can re -enable your network adapter as soon as Larian launcher pops up and Bob\\'s your uncle.). 99%  of time there\\'s no need for this, but I got burnt and didn\\'t wanna bother with rollback so I\\'m not lazy  to do it every time now, but mod manager will prevent update from starting\\n\\n***\\n**INCREASED DIFFICULTY MODS**\\n***\\n[Tactician Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/661)\\n\\n^This ^mod ^aims ^to ^increase ^or ^[decrease] ^the ^difficulty ^of ^the ^game, ^for ^use ^with ^mods ^like ^Party ^Limits ^Begone. ^With ^the ^new ^Modular ^design ^you ^can ^choose ^from ^an ^array ^of ^health ^boost ^and ^stat ^boost ^to ^add ^to ^your ^Tactician ^Mode ^play-though, ^with ^easily ^editable ^files, ^if ^I ^don\\'t ^have ^a ^preset ^that ^fits ^your ^needs.\\n\\n[Lethal AI Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1465)\\n\\n^Improves ^the ^AI ^of ^the ^enemies. ^Makes ^them ^much ^smarter\\n\\n[Immersive AI](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1835)^*\\n\\n^Immersive ^AI ^is ^a ^complete ^rewrite ^of ^BG3’s ^combat ^AI ^to ^make ^it ^more ^varied, ^immersive ^and ^fun ^to ^play.\\n^^* ^**NOTE:** ^Sounds ^promising, ^but ^not ^tested ^[yet] ^by ^me, ^Mod ^has ^pretty ^extensive ^documentation, ^available ^on ^the ^mod ^page ^or ^^[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tyBPQzqpEZcO72g_FcHcghHnuFq5FNORPMs6g4QnJJY/edit#heading=h.7kg4m8ye8aie),\\n\\n ^Description ^also ^states ^the ^following: ^V2 ^is ^finally ^here ^featuring ^massive ^changes ^to ^almost ^every ^AI ^in ^the ^game ^as ^well ^as ^hundreds ^of ^new ^AI.\\n\\n^I ^recommend ^you ^use ^Immersive ^AI ^alone ^without ^any ^other ^AI ^mods ^as ^it ^is ^far ^superior ^to ^all ^other ^AI ^mods.\\n^I ^have ^included ^a ^compatibility ^patch ^for ^use ^with ^Lethal ^AI ^but ^I ^recommend ^you ^use ^only ^Immersive ^AI ^as ^you ^do ^not ^need ^Lethal ^AI ^in ^all ^honesty ^if ^you ^are ^using ^my ^mod.\\n\\n\\n^^* ^^**NOTE:** ^^I ^^will ^^add ^^updates ^^as ^^I ^^test ^^the ^^mod, ^^this ^^is ^^one ^^of ^^those ^^at ^^the ^^top ^^5 ^^in ^^testing ^^queue\\n\\n[Orin\\'s True Bossfight](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4107)\\n\\n^Orin\\'s ^boss ^fight ^made ^proper. ^See ^description. ^SPOILER ^WARNING ^- ^Act ^3\\n\\nOverview:\\n^Orin\\'s ^boss ^fight ^has ^unused ^potential. ^You ^confront ^her ^in ^Slayer ^form, ^but ^when ^you ^defeat ^her, ^she\\'s ^just ^dead, ^while ^transformations ^usually ^revert ^the ^user ^to ^normal ^state ^when ^defeated.\\n\\n^This ^mod ^doest ^just ^that ^to ^Orin. ^When ^ou ^beat ^the ^Slayer ^form, ^you ^still ^got ^to ^fight ^Orin\\'s ^humanoid ^form. ^Makes ^it ^for ^a ^more ^interesting ^boss ^fight ^in ^two ^phases, ^as ^for ^the ^other ^Netherstones ^holders.\\n\\n^Plus, ^now ^there\\'s ^an ^actual ^benefit ^of ^playing ^a ^bad ^Dark ^Urge ^who ^becomes ^Chosen ^of ^Bhaal, ^as ^this ^prevents ^Orin ^from ^getting ^her ^Slayer ^form, ^thus ^making ^her ^actually ^weaker. \\n\\n\\n\\n[Death March -
