Very few games are as pleasing to the eyes, and coming from an indie studio – making its very first game, of all things – that’s something quite remarkable. Even more remarkable is that Kena isn’t simply a visual showcase, either. It’s challenging, fun to play, and has a world teeming with life. It also tells a fantastic story, and there’s plenty to do even when the credits have rolled. Kena: Bridge of Spirits truly is something special, and I can’t wait to see what Ember Lab does next.*|PS5|\\n|[**DualShockers**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/285/dualshockers) \\\\- [Rachael Fiddis](https://opencritic.com/critic/4037/rachael-fiddis)|100 \\\\~ [10 / 10](https://www.dualshockers.com/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review/)|*I really can’t recommend Kena: Bridge of Spirits highly enough that will see players partake in a meaningful journey absorbed in a vibrant world filled with fluid animations that cries out to be explored.

Despite fantastic production values it\\'s still far from a AAA title – so it\\'s important to keep expectations in check, but anyone looking to lose themselves in a charming, gorgeous world ripe for exploration should look no further.

There’s nothing all that frustrating in that - we shouldn’t expect games, especially those made by studios the size of Ember Labs, to be constantly groundbreaking, but so much of Kena feels borrowed from elsewhere that it’s difficult to call it great. It’s a solid, enjoyable experience, and charming enough that you won’t care that you’ve played versions of it before. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it’s a pretty nice wheel nonetheless.*|PS5|\\n|[**Explosion Network**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/654/explosion-network) \\\\- [Dylan Blight](https://opencritic.com/critic/5629/dylan-blight)|70 \\\\~ [7 / 10](https://explosionnetwork.com/game-reviews/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review)|*You feel the passion of Ember Lab to craft a cinematic game with Kena: Bridge of Spirits.

If you have watched the video, feel free to give your own opinion.\\n1. \"Some variants feel like strict upgrades over their original civilization\" this is completely not true. I don\\'t see variant of any civ beats its own counterpart. I would like to know wat the \\'strict upgrades\\' really are.\\n2. \"Variants have minor tweaks and play out similar to their original counterpart\" which is true for a aoe 4 player but most of his viewer base is aoe2 players. I\\'m sorry to aoe 2 ppl but variants of age 4 are like aoe 2 civs with same architecture and voice lines. I actually dont think the above quoted stuff is completely true since he said \"abbasids n ayyubids might even play identically even past minor tweaks\" and \"even with the added overhaul of unique units they gonna be played eXaCtLy the same as abbasids\" which we can overlook since he said he doesn\\'t know abbasids that well.\\n\"Based on 15 dollars it\\'s quite a bit of value\" bro aoe 2 just got a expansion and it\\'s for 15usd with 2 civs and here we getting 6 playable multi-player civs/variants, 10 maps, 2 biomes n campaign. It\\'s clear that he doesn\\'t like it that much(idk y) which is fine, everyone can have their own opinion. But I just find it disappointing that he can\\'t appreciate the work and effort put into this dlc. Maybe he does n I\\'m over reacting but I really like his videos even though I never played aoe2de ever, when saw he made aoe 4 video, I was quite happy but only found him as aoe 2 player who wants aoe 4 to be like aoe2(I\\'m sry but I said it).\\n\\n\\nEdit: Guys please keep your criticism civil. This is not a hate thread. We appreciate sotl for everything he has done to aoe community. I\\'m just disappointed that we disagree n i\\'m quite sure everyone will appreciate even 1 min video of him if they don\\'t have the concerns raised. \\n\\n\\nEdit2: I only said the last point becoz he said tech tree doesn\\'t have unit stats which is there in aoe2? Coz it\\'s definitely not there in aoe 3(where I come from) n I don\\'t remember it being a thing in AoM(not sure). Nothing personal about it :)', 'comments': ['I was unimpressed as well, which was disappointing because I like his content typically. Many of his criticisms of AoE4 could very easily be leveled at AoE2. I like both games for different reasons but implying that AoE4 Civs are somehow not dissimilar enough when I just played a game with Aztecs wearing European armor and wielding crossbows in AoE2 really misses the mark. It’s not that he has to *like* AoE4, it’s just that some of the criticisms were unfair when juxtaposed with the game his channel typically covers. I will concede that there were some legitimate complaints though, particularly concerning user generated content.', 'It just was not a very good review.\\n\\nFor example he calls new unique units like the Cataphract \"themed reskins\". He calls those same types of units in AoE2 unique units of at least \"replacement\" units. The AoE4 ones are MORE unique and more mechanically different than most AoE2 unique units.\\n\\nAlso, Ayyubids playing the exact same as Abbasids? They\\'re probably more different than any two AoE2 civs you could pick.\\n\\nOr calling some variants straight upgrades when it\\'s clear there\\'s no way he could possibly know if that\\'s at all true at this point. \\n\\nI think he just has a massive bias and is not good at making a review without that seeping in.\\n\\nIt\\'s fine to not like the game, but it\\'s very odd for your criticisms of it to be things that would be more effective against the game you don\\'t criticize.\\n\\nI\\'m not even talking about his final score, he just didn\\'t do a very good job with this review.', \"Folks, remember to keep the criticisms civil. While I do agree with some of the points most of you made here, please exercise better choice of words. Disagreing with his points and arguments is fine, but calling him various names isn't.\\n\\nSOTL is a very important part of our community, and attacking him is not it. We're all AoE players here and part of the same community, and the sooner we get away from this AoE2 vs AoE4 sentiment, the better.\\n\\nBut yes, creators' opinions can be subjective and/or skewed, and it's ok to disagree with said opinions in a civil way. I also found some of the points made in the video rather odd (and some just incorrect) myself.\", '>variants of age 4 are like aoe 2 civs with same architecture and voice lines.\\n\\nImo the variant comparison with AoE 2 civs never made sense. Variants in AoE 4 are more like the major god choice from AoM. You have the same base with Greeks, Egyptians, Norse, Atlanteans and Chinese but 3 major god per civ that all bring their unique twist.', 'I think he just knows his viewerbase is mostly aoe2 fans, and aoe2 fans LOVE to hear shit about aoe4, so he just did that lol\\n\\nseeing someone from aoe2 talking that a new civ in aoe4 is too similiar is borlerline hilarious to me. a new aoe2 civ is literally one unit, one tech, and a selection of having or not access to common upgrades lol']}, {'title': 'Kena: Bridge of Spirits reviews going live in about 12 hours', 'subreddit': 'PS5', 'url': 'https://twitter.com/SkillUpYT/status/1439975390345265153', 'selftext': '', 'comments': ['There was a Brazilian reviewer that posted early on Twitter, he writes for a good website in Brazil, but he locked his account looool.
