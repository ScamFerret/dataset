This company falsely advertises connections to luxury villas, but in reality, it's a fraudulent operation run by a single individual. My experience with them happened a year ago, but I'm retelling my story in hopes of preventing even just one person from falling victim to this scam.\\n\\nA year ago, I was scammed out of over $6,000, all paid through wire transfers, for a villa rental in Las Terrenas. The booking was abruptly canceled last minute, and I never got my money back. The scammer blamed it on bank issues, but it was just a tactic to buy time. I was in a desperate situation, trying to find last-minute accommodation for 25 friends and family who were there to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday in December.\\n\\nThrough some investigation, I found out that this individual had been deported from the States for similar fraudulent activities. I'm a Dominican living in NYC, and I fell for this scam, so I urge everyone, no matter where you're from, to be extremely cautious with online reservations and always do your due diligence.\\n\\nI managed to get their site shut down once, but the scammer has brought it back up just in time for the holidays. I'm posting this here to spread awareness and hopefully generate more attention if anyone Googles the company. \\n\\n**Please, I urge everyone to report their Instagram page to help shut down this fraudulent operation.**\\n\\nFor those who want further proof of this individual's actions, please visit the Instagram page **villasrdnet__scam**. There you'll find more information and stories from others who have been scammed.\\n\\nAlso, here's an article about another family that fell victim to this scam a few years back: [https://cdn.com.do/nacionales/denuncian-empresa-villasrd-estafa-clientes-en-renta-de-villa-en-samana/](https://cdn.com.do/nacionales/denuncian-empresa-villasrd-estafa-clientes-en-renta-de-villa-en-samana/).

Esta empresa anuncia falsamente conexiones con villas de lujo, pero en realidad, es una operación fraudulenta dirigida por un solo individuo. Mi experiencia con ellos ocurrió hace un año, pero la cuento de nuevo con la esperanza de prevenir que aunque sea una persona caiga en este engaño.\\n\\nHace un año, me estafaron más de $6,000 dólares, todo pagado mediante transferencias bancarias, por el alquiler de una villa en Las Terrenas. La reserva fue cancelada abruptamente en el último minuto, y nunca recuperé mi dinero. El estafador culpó a problemas bancarios, pero solo era una táctica para ganar tiempo. Me encontraba en una situación desesperada, tratando de encontrar alojamiento de último minuto para 25 amigos y familiares que estaban allí para celebrar el cumpleaños de mi novia en diciembre.\\n\\nDespués de investigar, descubrí que este individuo había sido deportado de Estados Unidos por actividades fraudulentas similares. Soy dominicano viviendo en Nueva York y caí en esta estafa, así que les insto a todos, sin importar de dónde sean, a ser extremadamente cautelosos con las reservas en línea y siempre hacer su debida diligencia.\\n\\nLogré que cerraran su sitio una vez, pero el estafador lo ha vuelto a abrir justo a tiempo para las fiestas. Publico esto aquí para crear conciencia y, con suerte, generar más atención si alguien busca la compañía en Google.\\n\\n**Por favor, les insto a todos a reportar su página de Instagram para ayudar a cerrar esta operación fraudulenta.**\\n\\nPara aquellos que quieran más pruebas de las acciones de este individuo, por favor visiten la página de Instagram **villasrdnet__scam**. Allí encontrarán más información e historias de otras personas que han sido estafadas.\\n\\nAdemás, aquí hay un artículo sobre otra familia que fue víctima de esta estafa hace unos años: [https://cdn.com.do/nacionales/denuncian-empresa-villasrd-estafa-clientes-en-renta-de-villa-en-samana/](https://cdn.com.do/nacionales/denuncian-empresa-villasrd-estafa-clientes-en-renta-de-villa-en-samana/). Es impactante cómo esta persona sigue estafando a la gente.\\n\\nPor favor, compartan esta información con sus amigos y familiares. Por mucho que ame mi país, la República Dominicana es un lugar donde es increíblemente difícil llevar a alguien a la justicia por este tipo de crímenes.\\n\\nManténganse seguros y alerta, todos.

Hope it helps, someone. \\n\\nGot back at a scammer\\n\\nSo in November I wanted a packer and mover to get a washing machine from my old residence to my new one. These are in two different states, like 600 Km apart.\\n\\nSo I put my details in an online website(my first mistake) and got a callback from this mover. He said he\\'d get the job done. He sent me his company details over WhatsApp. And asked for 500 Rs (6$) as deposit.\\nThe second mistake I made was that I gave a deposit before he even collected my stuff. \\n\\nWell he kept saying he\\'s sending someone to collect the next 2-3 days. And then stopped picking my calls. I checked online reviews and it turns out he\\'s done this to a few other people too. I asked him to refund my money. He kept saying he would but then started ignoring me.\\n\\nSo I put up a cybercrime complaint. Got in touch with a recovery guy. Found an SMS bomber app and kept bombing him 1000 SMS\\' every 2 hrs relentlessly.  Put up a complaint on national consumer forum. Emailed cybercrime officials. Fired all missiles at him I could.\\n\\nA week later I got a call from the cops. Talked to them.\\n\\n15 days from the start of this ordeal, this dude starts calling me. I said I wouldn\\'t pick up his phone unless he sends me my money. He kept begging for me to pick it up. \\nAnd when I didn\\'t, he sent me my money back. So I picked up his call. Turns out the cops blocked off his bank account :P\\nAnd he sent the money from another account.\\n\\nWell, I didn\\'t stop there. \\n\\nI made him send a video of himself and his social security details. Then I told him I\\'d not unblock his bank account till he gives me info of all the others he has scammed. And till he sends me screenshots of returning those people\\'s money. I got names of other people he\\'d conned. And since he kept calling me, I blocked him.\\n\\nIt\\'s been a month now and I got a call from a young lady. She asked me to unblock his number as she is his \"client\" and wants her refund from the blocked Bank account. This lady had the same name as he had revealed as a person he\\'d scammed.\\n\\nSo basically I explained to her that she\\'d been scammed and that he gave her my number just to manipulate her, or maybe pressure me in hopes that his bank account will be unblocked.\\nI told her that he\\'d give so and so other excuses, and those were the exact things he\\'d send to her. The same modus operandi.\\n\\nI gave her all his info, and even the other account number he\\'d sent me money from. I\\'ve told her how to proceed with the cops and get his other bank account also blocked, and pressure him into giving her money back. \\n\\nShe had to recover her item from an abandoned godown, and she\\'d actually gone to the address and it didn\\'t exist(obviously, it\\'s a fake address). \\n\\nI told her he\\'s actually not even in that state, but from another state in a village(As per the info I got from him, and that video I made him send). He\\'s taken 3k Rs (40$) from her. Which is a lot. So I\\'m now guiding her to hit him even harder so he lands up in Jail. And stops conning people.', 'Is that asshole on IG?', \"I'm so sorry !

So I decided to piece together my favorite bits of what I found and do a summary of the last chapters of the manga with them.\\n\\nSince this is quite long, I\\'ve divided it into different sections for your ease of reading\\n\\n**Spriggan 12 gathering**\\n\\n- Zeref takes Mavis to Spriggan 12. Reddit user ‘Ajuaju’ states that Mavis has been brought to the place where the Spriggan 12\\'s Secret Base. By the same token, Eileen has made her appearance. Mavis then senses the Scarlet Despair’s tremendous power and is taken aback. Zeref, in the contrary, does not scold Eileen for using Universe One. Zeref is even proud of Eileen. Mavis Vermillion has been overwhelmed with August’s and Eileen’s powers. Mavis cannot help but wonder if the Eileen can really do it\\n\\n- Zera is going on about how they will rescue Mavis when Natsu interrupts. The fire mage says he wants to fight August. Lucy Herafilia then reminds Natsu how powerful August is. Hence, Natsu asks Lucy to help him beat August. Subsequently, master Makarov appears and orders the wizards to lend him their ears. Yet, Cana cannot face his father. Gildarts asks Cana how she instead, his daughter tells Gildarts that she fails to protect Mavis.\\n\\n- The fairies keep on winning until God Serena makes his appearance. Natsu Dragneel is not amazing at all and eats the flames. Makarov will have to take on God Serena. Makarov holds Gildarts responsible for whatever happens to the fairies. A walking dead puppet cannot defeat the strongest mage of Fairy Tail. Gildarts finishes his battle with emyrean.\\n\\n**Gray vs Invel**\\n\\n- Gray proves that he is not guilty as Invel shows up. The mage seems to be a weather manipulator. To be exact, Invel can let anyone shiver in cold if he wants, too. Fans over at Reddit speculated that the former and Leon Vastia, an Ice-MakeMage, and current ace of Lamia, will collaborate to crush the Winter General.\\n\\n- Neinhart then challenges Erza for the second time. Titania accepts it with no second thought. Neinhart knows his Historia will not work so he has decided to use simple magic. Titania’s attacks are hindered with a blast of light. Larcade Dragneel steps out and complains to Neinhart about getting bored. Larcade attempts to *assault* Erza. Sting suddenly appears and blocks Larcade’s magic. (hey at least they got something right)\\n\\n- Meanwhile The group invades the location. Erza and Makarov face Eileen together while Sorano and Yukino help Mavis to get away.\\n\\n**Levy vs Bloodman**\\n\\n- Levy’s Vengeful Rage Defeats Bradman. Gajeel tries to persuade Levy not to do anything unnecessary. But, Levy has already left with Jet and Droy. Jet and Droy beat the Spriggan 12.\\n\\n**Gray and Juvia**\\n\\n- The winter mage then binds Gray and Juvia with his magic. Juvia attempts to kill herself with her water magic but Gray immediately hinders Juvia. Juvia and Gray icily glare at each other like a predator would eye its prey. Gray calls Juvia stupid. Gray tells her how she is making the situation a lot worse. Juvia does not like Gray’s tone and unconsciously uses her Water Lock magic on Gray. Juvia uses her water slicer to send Gray flying. \\n\\n- Gray thrusts his ice molded sword into his body. Juvia cringes. Gray assures Juvia that he is fine and tells her to never fall unconscious again. And as the fire mage senses Gray aura, he will notice that something seems to be different. Natsu will also tell Lucy that he cannot sense a gist of Juvia’s magic.\\n\\n- As the winter mage unveils E.N.D’s identity, Gray loses his fighting spirit. Subsequently, the water mage scans her surrounding looking for Gray. Juvia, Wendy and Carla come running to Gray’s side. Wendy suggests that she will continue Gray’s battle. Juvia tells Wendy that she will cover her so she can attack without hesitation. Invel questions the group if they are insulting him. The winter mage implies that he does not want to play with children. This statement [hurts Wendy’s feelings](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111008073928/fairytail/images/thumb/1/15/Wendy_Crying_after_Trial.jpg/640px-Wendy_Crying_after_Trial.jpg). But Gray finds Natsu is E.N.D. When Natsu pats his friend’s back, Gray glares at him. Lucy does not mind the two fairies until Gray raises his hand against Natsu. Lucy asks Happy to guard Natsu and Gray until she gets back.\\n\\n- Lucy and Scorpio try to victor against Brandish. Brandish keeps her mouth shut. Dimaria thereafter proclaims that Brandish is no good.\\n\\n**Mest tries to hook up with Mavis**\\n\\n- Mest tells Mavis that he controls Brandish. Avid readers of the manga must have thought of Mest confessing his \"silly actions\" to Mavis. The first master is enraged with the news. Mavis cannot believe that Mest is capable of doing something outrageous. Mest gets a lot of scolding from the first master. Mavis then claims that she will  consult master Makarov about Mest’s punishment.\\n\\n**E.N.D.**\\n\\n- Jumping at Lucy, Dimaria tries to claw Lucy’s eyes out. This cat-fight causes Lucy’s chair to break. When Lucy wakes up, her vision seems blurry because of the blood gushing out from her wounded eyes. Porlyusica worries about Natsu. The healing specialist discloses that Natsu’s tumor is not a tumor. The tumor will not literally control or take over Natsu. Well, that will be weird.\\n\\n- More even, Natsu attacks the ice wizard. The first generation master of Fairy Tail denies Eileen Belserion’s indictment.\\n\\n- Gray assaults Natsu. Gray molds an ice hammer, attempting to stop the fire mage’s movements. Nevertheless, Natsu easily deflects it using his fire and wicked magic.\\n\\n**Makarov\\'s death**\\n\\n- Master Makarov is about to activate Fairy Law when Mavis comes running warning Makarov that the technique can cause his life. Master Makarov is about to chant Fairy Law. Master Makarov turns into a stone and Eileen’s magic breaks him into pieces.\\n\\n**Laxus stopping Gray and Natsu**\\n\\n- Juvia and Lucy find the two guys, yet the two fairies have lost it; Thereafter, Juvia and Lucy decide to use the Unison Raid. ‘G-Spark233’ thinks the entire battle is dumb. The user ‘Rex_Connor’ even labels Erza as a terrible character. ‘ino0987’ cannot believe that Erza can easily stop E.N.D’s and a Devil Slayer’s magic with her bare hands without getting hurt. ‘uzee’ raises the topic with regard to the Fairy Tail members that keeps on getting on their feet after experiencing a tough torture like Juvia and Gajeel\\n\\n- Yet, before Natsu can even punch Erza, Laxus suddenly appears, announcing their master’s death. Gray sees Juvia; injured but alive. This is more than enough for Gray to raise the white flag. Although Titania does not forbid the fairies to fight.\\n\\n- Elsewhere, Jellal and the Oracion Seis gang up on August. Gildarts tells his pals to hold their horses and leave the big boss to him. The other Oracion Seis members attempt to cause August even the slightest damage.\\n\\n**Irene and Erza**\\n\\n- Doing Wendy a favor, Eileen directly says to Erza, “I am you and you are me.” Fans must have been wondering what exactly \"Eileen\" means. Some predict Eileen will be defeated by Wendy and Erza. Other scenario suggest that Irene will be stabbed by the back by Acnologia, who was sent somewhere far by the Enchantress.\\n\\n- In continuation, Wendy heals Gray and Natsu. Marching from behind, Porlyusica comes into view. Porlyusica shoos Wendy away from Natsu and Gray informs her that her task ends there. “That’s right, Wendy. Listen to the scary woman.” On that account, Natsu tells Gray that they have to fight the last boss.\\n\\n**Larcade**\\n\\n- In line with this, Larcade’s magic begins to pleasure his allies, too. Thus, Zeref orders Larcade to deactivate his magic. And like a good son would do, Larcade obeys his father. But since Kagura can perceive a lot more Spriggans, she tasks Yukino and Angel to find them. Mikazuchi tries to stick to her swordsmanship. This, on the contrary, suggests that Mavis needs to pull off \"the technique\".\\n\\n- According to ‘Poké-Pro somasora7 Wonderful Parfume!!’ of Reddit, Natsu\\'s heart may refer to a case of heartburn. According to ‘Hover:Shows Title’ of Reddit, Zeref reveals that Natsu will die soon. The Dragneel family excluding Zeref have died. However a dragon sends fire to the village. But the question is: Is this the only power Larcade have? \\n\\n- **ZEREF\\'S SON SMELLS LIKE NATSU NOT BLACK WIZARD**\\n\\nAnd that is it.

The last 3 seasons were 3 promotions - in 2016/17 they played on the 4th tier, in 2017/18 on the 3rd tier and in 2018/19 on the 2nd tier. Some of the players went all this way (including captain Michał Kołba). The last season was not particularly difficult. With a small break, the club was on the 2nd position from the 16th matchday. ŁKS plays offensively and with a large amount of passes, as a team coached by Kazimierz Moskal should befit. The manager is known for his style and had excellent executors - Dani Ramirez and Patryk Bryła. The first one was the best footballer of the season with 9 goals and 15 assists. The leader of perfect defence was 20-year-old Jan Sobociński, Poland U20 NT player and one of the main candidates for the discovery of the season. The success of the club is also based on a good transfer policy - they buy cheaply but wisely.\\n\\n**This season**\\n\\nThe changes are minimal. Midfielders Guima (from Portuguese second league) and Pirulo (from Spanish third league) have a chance to play. Lukaš Bielak left the club because he did not fit the concept of coach Moskal. A big advantage of ŁKS is its good chemistry - these people know each other very well. However, the problem may be the lack of experience. Only a few footballers played in Ekstraklasa, out of which only 34-year-old central midfielder Łukasz Piątek knows the league really well (246 matches). The future of club is uncertain. They resemble Górnik Zabrze, which took 4th place 2 years ago - that team also consisted mainly of Poles unknown to most of the audience (following I Liga is another level of initiation into Polish football).\\n\\n**Lineup**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwjsu6teqmb31.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=8847cebdd0a6337db3c31f0c89780ec16c9b69af\\n\\n**Final prediction**\\n\\nEasily avoiding relegation.

They barely avoided relegation by defeating Termalica in the last matchday. Despite the terrible results, owners decided not to fire coach Fornalik and give him more time. As in the case of Michał Probierz in Cracovia - it was worth it. Piast became the most shocking champion since Śląsk Wrocław in the 2011/12 season, or maybe even more. It was not a season-long adventure, as in the case of Leicester. For most of the time Piast was in the middle of the table. During the winter break they were 8th, 11 points behind the 1st Lechia. After division of the league into championship and relegation group they were already 3rd, but with a significant gap to Lechia and Legia. Only after 2-0 win in Gdańsk people started (jokingly) asking \"Why not Piast?\" And it was actually Piast. This season was the opposite of 2015/16 season, when club was the leader of the table for vast majority of time, but in the end released the lead from the hands and ended on 2nd position. If the football teams were compared to people, Piast would certainly have a borderline disorder - either fight for the highest goals or fight for avoiding relegation. When it comes to players, it is difficult to point a particular prominent figure. Everyone did their best, average footballers became unexpectedly good. Coach Waldemar Fornalik once again proved that he is a specialist and should not be regarded as a bad manager only because of terrible year in the Poland NT.\\n\\n[Bonus - all 57 goals scored by Piast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSsbQ2ot34w)\\n\\n**This season**\\n\\nFrom the important players, only centre-back Aleksandar Sedlar (transfer to Mallorca) and defensive midfielder Tomasz Jodłowiec (return from the loan to Legia) left. Interesting new faces are centre-back Tomaš Huk (from Dunajska Streda), left midfielder Jakub Holubek (MŠK Žilina) and striker Dani Aquino (AEK Larnaca). Piast made also a great deal by contracting one of the best right-backs of the league, Korona\\'s captain Bartosz Rymaniak for free. The centre of the midfield may be a problem. Couple Hateley-Dziczek remained untouched, but after Jodłowiec\\'s departure their substitutes are young inexperienced Sokołowski and Milewski. On Wednesday Piast was eliminated from the Champions League qualifiers by BATE. And this shows the value of Ekstraklasa very well.\\n\\n**Lineup**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vo4wd77rmb31.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=abfdd40993262e563b10b8823a055dc0160c4940\\n\\n**Final prediction**\\n\\nPolish Leicester will most likely go full Leicester and end somewhere between 5th and 8th place.\\n\\n# [Pogoń Szczecin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/thumb/8/81/Pogon_Szczecin.svg/1200px-Pogon_Szczecin.svg.png)\\n\\n**Coach:** [Kosta Runjaić](https://s5.dziennik.pl/pliki/12179000/12179499-kosta-runjaic-900-600.jpg)  \\n**Captain:** Adam Frączczak  \\n**Most caps:** Leszek Wolski (348, 1971-1987)  \\n**Top scorer:** Leszek Wolski (87, 1971-1987)  \\n**Debut:** 1959  \\n**Biggest achievement:** Runners-up (2 times: 1986/1987, 2000/2001)  \\n**Last season:** 7th place  \\n**Nickname(s):** The Dockers, The Pride of Pomerania  \\n**Stadium:** [Florian Krygier Stadium (4 800 during reconstruction)](https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_gVM5XNKbVA0PGB0yjNBJyU0rTa1WSPH0.jpg)  \\n**2018/19 gif of the season:** [https://streamable.com/dl4jx](https://streamable.com/dl4jx)\\n\\n**Last season**\\n\\n|Position|Points|W|D|L|GF|GA|GD|Biggest win|Biggest defeat|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|7|52|14|10|13|57|54|\\\\+3|4-0 vs Wisła P|0-3 vs Sosnowiec/Piast/Zagłębie|\\n\\nPogoń is one of the most stable teams in Ekstraklasa. Out of the last 6 seasons, they finished 5 between 6th and 8th place. It was no different this time. Despite a disastrous start (comparable to Cracovia) the team got a grip and took the 7th place. Not great, not terrible. As usual. After 8 matches without any victory Pogoń got cracking in the 9th matchday and started playing much better. The centre of midfield - the excellent trio of Podstawski, Kožulj and Drygas - stood out the most. Playmaker Radosław Majewski had to be shifted to the wing to allow each of them to play in the starting eleven. Being on the higher position in the table was hindered by recurring loses from time to time. First there was one defeat per three wins, but later results started becoming more and more random. Captain Adam Frączczak, who was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor, could not play for almost the entire season. Fortunately, he is now fully healthy.\\n\\n**This season**\\n\\nThere have been many changes in the team, especially in defence. Poland U20 NT centre-back Sebastian Walukiewicz was sold to Cagliari. The solid Fojut and Niepsuj also left. Playmaker Majewski joined Western Sydney Wanderers. Pogoń lost also a few other less important substitutes. A couple of centre-backs will be formed by new players - Zech from Rheindorf Altach and Triantafyllopoulos from Asteras Tripolis. Other interesting transfers include winger Spiridonović and striker Manias - both from the Greek league. The weakest position is the goalkeeper. Stipica spent the whole season on the bench in CSKA Sofia, and his substitutes are either weak (Bursztyn) or completely inexperienced (children).\\n\\n**Lineup**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ak3zwihrrmb31.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=07904c2b2dc329e24b1ff837643659ff3f283e4c\\n\\n**Final prediction**\\n\\nBetween 3rd place in most optimistic scenario and 8th in most pessimistic.

The club dominated I Liga and left no doubt who is the best. They were first from the beginning (with 2 matchdays of the break) and in addition, in Polish Cup they eliminated Lech, Legia and only in the semifinal lost minimally to Lechia 0-1. Marek Papszun\\'s team is the only team in Poland which plays properly in the formation 3-4-3 (many tried, only they succeeded). Another characteristic trait of Raków is the excellent use of set pieces - top scorer of the team was centre-back Tomaš Petrašek (8 goals). He may be considered a key player and the greatest star of the team. The end of the season was a disappointment. Raków started losing and drawing, so their lead in the table is not as visible as it could be. In the past, coach Papszun was a PE teacher. He became Raków\\'s manager when he was on unpaid leave and wanted to earn some money.\\n\\n**This season**\\n\\nAfter the description of the previous season you probably think that Raków will be the dark horse of Ekstraklasa. Well, not necessarily. While the ŁKS Łódź reminds me of Górnik Zabrze from 2 years ago, the history of Raków is similar to that of Miedź Legnica from a year ago. An offensive team with its own style, which dominated I Liga and was praised by the media a bit too much. What\\'s worse, they will have to (like another new team which got relegated, Sandecja Nowy Sącz 2 years ago) play on someone else\\'s stadium, in Bełchatów, more than 70 kilometres away. Stadium in Częstochowa did not meet the criteria for being used in Ekstraklasa. There was also a traditional element of being a new club in the league, which is buying strange foreigners. All these factors make Raków not arousing my trust, although I wish them well. I hope I\\'m wrong, because Marek Papszun seems to be a really good manager.\\n\\n**Lineup**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlbgzzffsmb31.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=9582c4e78cfa8476fae96c042880e958796d55ad\\n\\n**Final prediction**\\n\\nRelegation or barely avoiding relegation.

They ended last 4 seasons between 10th and 12th place. The last one, however, was more difficult - they fought to avoid relegation almost to the very end and were saved by a few good last matches. After a poor autumn, coach Tadeusz Pawłowski was replaced by Czech Vitezslav Lavička - former manager of Sparta Praga and Czech U21 NT. After difficult weeks, he eventually achieved his goal. His personal decisions, such as moving the left-back Mateusz Cholewiak to the wing (where he played before the transfer) and moving Latvia international centre-back Igors Tarasovs on the bench helped. The team was exceptionally old. Club broke records such as \"the oldest goal scorer for Śląsk\" or \"the oldest starting eleven in the history of Śląsk\". The key player of Śląsk was the 36-year-old experienced striker Marcin Robak, who scored 18 goals again. Iranian winger Farshad Ahmadzadeh was a disappointment and did not fulfill hopes at all.\\n\\n**This season**\\n\\nMarcin Robak and his substitute Arkadiusz Piech left the club. All responsibility for scoring goals now lies on Erik Exposito from UD Las Palmas, who scored one goal in La Liga. Other interesting transfers are the centre-back Israel Puerto (from RC Recreativo de Huelva) and winger Przemysław Płacheta (Poland U21 NT player from I Liga). The defence leader will traditionally be the club legend Piotr Celeban, while Krzysztof Mączyński, a player of the strating eleven of Poland NT on EURO 2016, will lead the midfield. In fact, the most depends on strikers. The only alternatives for Exposito are inexperienced youngsters. If Spaniard turns out to be a transfer flop and doesn\\'t replace Robak well, Śląsk will be in terrible situation.\\n\\n**Lineup**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nrjbdsjltmb31.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdfb41f4b780dacd79696837f9fe9f7d35c740c4\\n\\n**Final prediction**\\n\\nBottom eight.

To put it briefly:\\n\\n\\\\- the debt was enormous.\\n\\n\\\\- until winter Wisła was ruled by a criminal group.\\n\\n\\\\- after a documentary on this topic, club started looking for a new investor\\n\\n\\\\- Wisła\\'s licence was suspended\\n\\n\\\\- Rafał Wisłocki, free from any ties with gangsters, became the new president\\n\\n\\\\- in December the club was almost sold to a mysterious Thai, which seemed like an obvious scam and thankfully didn\\'t happen.\\n\\n\\\\- in January Jakub Błaszczykowski and 2 local businessmen granted a loan to Wisła, the licence was restored\\n\\nGiven all these problems, the season was very successful for Wisła and the 9th place can be considered a great success. Matches of the team were very exciting - they had the best attack and the third worst defence in the league. Wisła from autumn and Wisła from spring were two different teams. There were so many transfers during winter break that it is impossible to say about all of them. I will mention only one thing - Błaszczykowski returned after 12 years.\\n\\n**This season**\\n\\nIn terms of finances, it will certainly be calmer (although still far from ideal). Situation is different when it comes to football - here new season may be more difficult. The composition of the Wisła team is heavily unbalanced. The first eleven is strong, but bench looks rather weak. Every injury and suspension is very painful for the club. And there are currently 7 injured players. Age differences are also significant. There are only a few \"middle-aged\" players here, most of them are either young/very young or old/very old. The strongest points of the team are of course Błaszczykowski (currently injured) and a couple of central midfielders Basha-Savićević (both currently injured). 39-year-old Marcin Wasilewski (former player of Anderlecht and Leicester) will often play in defence and 36-year-old Paweł Brożek (former player of Trabzonspor and Celtic) in attack.\\n\\n**Lineup**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/db0n7ls2umb31.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=52771982f6307b96c25c00add9051eaed930528b\\n\\n**Final prediction**\\n\\nBottom eight, but without the danger of relegation.

In 2017/18 season they took 5th place and until the end fought for the participation in the Europa League qualifiers. Shortly afterwards, coach Jerzy Brzęczek joined Poland NT and left the club. His successors were Dariusz Dźwigała (until October) and Kibu Vicuna (until April). Both did not meet the challenge and relegation was becoming more and more possible. Then Wisła hired Leszek Ojrzyński, the most outstanding of the \"firefighters\" (this is how we call managers who save clubs in a hopeless situation). He did his job, although it wasn\\'t easy - the team became safe from relegation only on the last matchday. The key player of Wisła was a defensive midfielder Dominik Furman, easily the best footballer of the team (6 goals, 7 assists). Position of the goalkeeper was a significant problem. German Thomas Dähne made a lot of mistakes and his substitutes were no better either.\\n\\n**This season**\\n\\n4 defenders left the club and 4 new ones came - including Jakub Rzeźniczak (participant of the Champions League with Legia and Qarabag) and Michał Marcjanik (loaned from Empoli). The role of winger Alen Stevanović (former player of Inter in 2009/10 season) will also be more important. Due to the new rules about young players, the main goalkeeper will be Bartłomiej Żynel, who, unfortunately for Wisła, does not seem to be better than Dähne. The team will certainly not be enjoyable to watch. Coach Ojrzyński is the personification of what r/soccer calls *Proper Brexit Football*. Of course it will be effective, as always.\\n\\n**Lineup**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sizavourumb31.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=336e9eaad3e1e53e3dc1137dbc1f3c425cf9a206\\n\\n**Final prediction**\\n\\nLike another Wisła - bottom eight, but without the danger of relegation. The bonus may be good results in Polish Cup, in the finals of which Ojrzyński played twice with his previous club - Arka.\\n\\n# [Zagłębie Lubin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fi/3/31/Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie_Lubin_Logo.png)\\n\\n**Coach:** [Ben van Dael](https://s9.dziennik.pl/pliki/11916000/11916448-ben-van-dael-900-600.jpg)  \\n**Captain:** Lubomir Guldan  \\n**Most caps:** Andrzej Szczypkowski (251, 1995-2000, 2001-2007)  \\n**Top scorer:** Radosław Jasiński (40, 1992-1995, 1996-1998, 1999-2000)  \\n**Debut:** 1985/1986  \\n**Biggest achievement:** Champions (2 times: 1990/1991, 2006/2007)  \\n**Last season:** 6th place  \\n**Nickname(s):** The Coppers  \\n**Stadium:** [Zagłębie Lubin Stadium (16 068)](http://stadiony.net/pictures/stadiums/pol/dialog_arena/dialog_arena07.jpg)  \\n**2018/19 gif of the season:** [https://gfycat.com/pl/scornfulimpeccablejaguar-football](https://gfycat.com/pl/scornfulimpeccablejaguar-football)\\n\\n**Last season**\\n\\n|Position|Points|W|D|L|GF|GA|GD|Biggest win|Biggest defeat|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|6|53|15|8|14|57|48|\\\\+9|4-0 vs Śląsk/Jagiellonia|1-3 vs Arka|\\n\\nZagłębie had two faces last season. In the first months team was colorless, boring and its coach Mariusz Lewandowski most likely had no idea what he was doing. In the round of 32 of Polish Cup Lubinians lost 2-3 to the 4th tier Huragan Morąg. A few weeks later Lewandowski was replaced by his assistant, Dutchman Ben van Dael. Initially he was supposed to be a temporary manager, but team started to play so well that he remained on this position permanently. Although it didn\\'t look like that for a long time, Zagłębie ended season in the championship group on the 6th place. The key player was the - as usual - playmaker Filip Starzyński, who still guarantees high quality, although every year he is becoming less and less impressive. An important role was also played by the couple of wingers Pawłowski-Bohar. There was a problem with the position of striker. Tuszyński is on lower level than most of his teammates and Mareš quickly fell into mediocrity.\\n\\n**This season**\\n\\nAfter selling Filip Jagiełło to Genoa, a couple of central midfielders will be formed by 20-year-old Slisz and 19-year-old Poręba. The situation in attack is to be improved by Rok Sirk from the Slovenian league. There are many young players in a wide squad - Zagłębie has the second best academy in Poland after Lech and is perfectly prepared to function after the introduction of new rules. The goal for this season is to qualify for European competitions, as in the previous few years. In this aspect, Zagłębie is similar to Pogoń. New season is always \"supposed to be this season\" and there is always something missing, there is always someone better.\\n\\n**Lineup**\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dpmsahgkvmb31.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa3592d51e877c27cccf4aa5939208dd2b3fddfc\\n\\n**Final prediction**\\n\\nBetween 4th and 8th place. Zagłębie is not bad, but the others are just better.\\n\\n# The most important rivalries\\n\\n|Team A|Team B|Details|\\n|:-|:-|:-|\\n|Arka Gdynia|Lechia Gdańsk|Tricity Derby|\\n|Cracovia|Wisła Kraków|Holy War (Kraków Derby)|\\n|Górnik Zabrze|Piast Gliwice|Little Silesian Derby (in Great Silesian Derby Górnik plays against Ruch Chorzów, currently 4rd tier club)|\\n|Lechia Gdańsk|Pogoń Szczecin|Derby of Pomerania|\\n|Legia Warsaw|Górnik Zabrze|Derby of Poland (historical)|\\n|Legia Warsaw|Wisła Kraków|Derby of Poland (historical)|\\n|Legia Warsaw|Lech Poznań|Derby of Poland (current)|\\n|Legia Warsaw|Jagiellonia Białystok|Relatively new rivalry, connected with growing importance of Jagiellonia in Polish football|\\n|Śląsk Wrocław|Zagłębie Lubin|Lower Silesia Derby|\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Correction**\\n\\nIn the previous part, I made quite a big factual mistake. I wrote that coach Piotr Stokowiec in 2015/16 took 3rd place with Zagłębie Lubin in his first season. This is obviously not true - in fact, it was already his third season in Zagłębie, first after promotion from I Liga. It was my understatement, thanks to u/Bartoni17 for pointing it out. :pepcio:', 'comments': ['Cheers for this mate, noticed when I was going through some of the nicknames for the clubs are great!', \"This is excellent work.
