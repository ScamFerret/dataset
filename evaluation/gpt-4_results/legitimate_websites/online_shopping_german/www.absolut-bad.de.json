Very bad. Downright terrible. Cringe-inducing to the point of being unbearable.\\n\\nAnd no, it\\'s not because of how women are portrayed in the film or toxic masculinity or whatever. I don\\'t care about all that because films should get a pass when it comes to things like these, imo.\\n\\nI thought it was just...bad all-around. In terms of story (bad, unrealistic), dialogue (cringe-inducing and unrealistic), acting (although I guess the actors gotta work with whatever script is given to them, so I can\\'t really blame them), and cinematography (unnecessary close-up shots).\\n\\nI\\'m kinda trying to wrap my head around the fact that it\\'s been doing so well.

The film actually makes me feel like an elitist for disliking it so much, even though I don\\'t even watch very many films/shows to begin with lmao.\\n\\nBut don\\'t you guys feel like Indian OTT stuff is just so much better?

Their acting is just the kind of subtle acting that one can actually call *good acting*. There are very few people that I\\'ve seen do this kind of acting in India: Manoj Bajpayee, Pankaj, Rajkummar Rao, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Naseerudin Shah, Irrfan Khan (RIP), and Anupam Kher to name a few.

I really enjoyed that place and it’s like 15 minutes away from tulum.\\n\\n- I rented a car which I do not regret doing but beware of the cops because I was driving on the highway and got stopped at one of their random stops and they said I was driving too fast (20km/hour) so anyway the dirty cops threatened me give me a huge ticket or Wtver unless I give them 400 Mexican pesos . I negotiated to give 300, they accepted but I only had 500’s so I gave him my 500 hundred expecting some change (lol) and of course he kept it all and told me to go. I thought it was more funny than anything but still very annoying to get scammed like that.\\n\\n- Tulum is very very expensive. Probably my most expensive trip. Everything is just way too overpriced and even the food. You can survive with a decent amount of money but if you want to do activities everyday you will have to pay $$$. \\n\\n- Way too many cops , army and wtver they are everywhere. I guess it’s a dangerous area. Idk I haven’t seen anything crazy but I guess that you wouldn’t know when you’re not from there. \\n\\n- stay hydrated because it’s extremely hot , just wow.\\n\\n- stayed in Cancún too a bit and it wasn’t worth it at all.\\n\\n- went to Isla mujeres and it’s absolutely not worth it for the price . I enjoyed my time there but 600 Mexican pesos to take the boat and another 1600 pesos to rent a golf cart ?
