However, it does mention that they are renovating and wishes a good start to the year 2020, which seems outdated since the current year is beyond that. It also provides a physical address, phone number, and email, which appear to be potentially legitimate, though I would need to verify this information. The mention of Jimdo GmbH suggests the website might be built using a website builder, which isn't unusual but requires further analysis.
