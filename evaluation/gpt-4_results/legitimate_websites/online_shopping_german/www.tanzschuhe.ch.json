No unrealistic claims about money are observed. The text does not seem to target human psychological weaknesses. It mentions a physical store location in Zürich, Switzerland, which could be verifiable. The products are specialized (dance shoes and related attire), which is not uncommon for niche e-commerce websites. No inquiry phone number or email address has been observed yet. The privacy policy and payment methods have not been assessed. The information listed seems appropriate for a dance shoe retailer and there is no indication that it hasn't been updated.
