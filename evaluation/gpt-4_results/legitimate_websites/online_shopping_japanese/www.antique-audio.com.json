Before they married, audio and music were his great passions. Three years later, all that stuff is sitting in the attic and he is allowed to listen to a bluetooth speaker, or headphones. (Meanwhile, her tawdry knick-knacks, which he hates, are everywhere in their home: owl figurines (on doilies no less), antique dolls, the works.\\n\\nI suppose that\\'s an extreme case but in light of [this new post](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/z3m47k/solved_wife_hates_audio_aesthetic/) in r/audiophile, I gotta ask: Why is your significant other the one who ultimately gets to decide what *your joint living space* looks like? All these audiophiles who just meekly go along with their partner, and mention \"wife acceptance factor\" and nod knowingly, and then give up the hobby or go with in-wall speakers...WTF? If your partner is *that* unconcerned with one of your great pleasures, your enjoyment of music / sonic art, why are you with that person? Why does *her* sense of appropriate decor win out over yours?\\n\\nI\\'m not saying that *you* should get to decide; I\\'m saying that there ought to be room for compromise, mutual understanding, and respect, rather than letting your SO dictate what s/he will accept.', 'comments': ['My wife and I co-own our hifi shop together, which is also a modern interior design shop. \\n\\nThe entire enterprise was born out of this misunderstanding that “women” don’t get or\\ncare about hifi. A bit of a rant follows. Apologies in advance…\\n\\nStep back for a second. \\n\\nMost people don’t even know our hobby exists, period. Most hifi shops or hobbyists are predominantly male, and most male hobbyists frankly suck at talking to women in particular and people outside their hobby in general - with all the accordant gate-keeping and snobbery. \\n\\nHifi as an industry is terrible at explaining how it\\nmakes day to day life a better thing, or how much breadth of design is available to address the aesthetic without compromising a valuable connection with music.\\n\\nIf we start by not using bullshit phrases like “wife acceptance factor” or considering “the little lady” as if her objections are some obstacle bred from ignorance, and instead just invite our female friends, partners, and family members into the hobby like we do our male equivalents, the entire conversation shifts.\\n\\nThat’s precisely because the second any person begins to understand the functional aspects of how this stuff works, and how much joy it can bring, they start to weight it’s value along those lines as well.\\n\\nFrom there we can all take a beat and recognize the over-1000 brands and endless models we have to select from with a variety of finishes, shapes, sizes and sound profiles, and creating a great-sounding system, sans compromises, that also looks great to you and your partner becomes imminently doable.\\n\\nThe only investment aesthetics requires is an understanding of how each partner sees things, and a willingness to invest the time finding the perfect solution.\\n\\nOur shop spends a *ton* of time deprogramming this kind of thinking, and as a result has a huge amount of success working with couples and female clients.\\n\\nIt’s weird how not pigeonholing an entire group of people that also love music, and instead allowing them to discover the hobby the same way we do as men leads to almost identical outcomes.\\n\\nNow, just like my male clients that discover us through our design work and aren’t already into audio, *most* people you give a first demo to think it’s neat, but only a few of them are going to be absolutely riveted. For whatever reasons, a lot of folks can appreciate great sound but it’s not their thing.\\n\\nAll to say, if your partner isn’t into your hobby, it may be because you’ve been essentially standing in your own way with the way you talk about it - instead of sharing that passion in a way that leaves room for them to find their own investment in it.\\n\\n…or maybe they’re like 95% of people and can appreciate it to a degree, but it’s not their sun, moon and stars - and that’s okay. Find a compromise you’re both into. It takes work but a happy relationship takes compromise and that takes work.\\n\\nWe can all be a bit better about how we talk about and share our enthusiasm. The only thing worse than shoving it down someone’s throat leaving zero room for them to invest in this new idea is telling them to their face, actively or passively, that it’s just not *for them*.', 'I mean, it\\'s all a matter of mutual respect isn\\'t it? My girlfriend accepts my rather large Focals and 14\" subwoofer because she knows I enjoy it. I\\'m not putting big ass avant garde accoustics speakers with dual tube amps and a rack full of equipment in my living room because I know she wouldn\\'t appreciate the looks. Relationships are a two way street.\\n\\nEdit: And because I can\\'t afford it.', \"My parents have been together for 32 years and I know my mum have 0 interest in hifi, but she still lends my dad an ear on the topic, because she can see he really cares about hifi. \\n\\nEven if what he says goes right over her head.\\n\\nAs long as it doesn't look too ostentatious in the living room, she don't care. And I know my dad also don't want ostentatious stuff in the living room\", 'My partner hates my Anthony Gallow speakers, says they look like Dyson vacuum cleaners, and will get anyone who comes over to agree with her. \\n\\nBut at the end of the day it’s tough shit, the speakers stay in the living room for all to see!', 'Your friend has no sense of self and allowed this to happen.']}]"
