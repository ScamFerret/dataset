Something you get as a tough beater, something that will give you great value for money and something you won’t have to fear banging on a doorsill. But, much like Seiko, Citizen also has a very robust offering of higher-end watches. At the very tip of that high end range is the infuriatingly named “The Citizen” collection - these are watches with premium movements, better quality materials and are, usually, limited to the Japanese market. However, Citizen just announced their latest addition to The Citizen collection will be coming to the United States, although I’m not sure about the rest of the world. It is called the The Citizen Eco-Drive Black Washi Paper Dial Limited Edition AQ4103-16E and it is unlike any other Citizen you have seen - in looks, in internals and definitely in price.\\n\\nThis Citizen is made out of Super Titanium with a bright yellow gold Duratect coating making it look, at least in photos, as if it’s actually made out of solid gold. Live, with the titanium lightness, I doubt you would mistake it for the precious metal, but it still looks good. The watch measures 38.3mm wide and 12.2mm thick, gets a double-domed sapphire crystal with anti-reflective treatment and a solid screw-down caseback is engraved with The Citizen collection’s signature eagle insignia. The same eagle appears on the tip of the signed crown at the 3 o’clock location, and right next to it on the side of the case is a small recessed pusher that is used during the setting process. .\\n\\nWhile the case is already a step up from the rest of the Citizen lineup, the real stunner is a dial. While I have only seen this in pictures, this looks like a dial that would easily find it’s place in a Grand Seiko limited edition. According to Citizen, the black washi paper dial is handcrafted by master papermakers and sprinkled with gold leaf using a traditional Japanese decorative technique called Sunago-maki. Keep in mind, this is a watch powered by an Eco-Drive solar-powered movement, so the semi-transparent nature of washi paper makes it ideal, while care must be taken when applying the gold leaf to not cover too much of the dial. Also, since this is a hand made dial, every single one is unique.\\n\\nSpeaking of the Eco-Drive… Inside is the brand’s Eco-Drive Caliber A060 high-accuracy solar quartz movement, their most premium movement. Just like the others, it can be powered by natural or artificial light and in energy-saving mode can run up to a year in darkness. The accuracy is as crazy as you would expect from a premium quartz movement and measures -/+5 seconds per year. You also get a perpetual calendar, low-power warning, and independently adjustable hour hand, along with automatic hand position adjustment. The watch comes on a premium two-piece black crocodile leather strap with gold contrast stitching running down either side and a gold colored deployant style clasp.\\n\\nThis is the highest level of Citizen you can buy, and it’s an interesting proposal. The Citizen line has had some great watches in the Japanese market, and now the rest of the world can see what they are doing. However, only 350 pieces will be made and they are priced at $3,800. That’s a hell of a lot of money for a quartz-powered Citizen. Yes it’s their most advanced watch, yes it has a hand-made paper dial with gold flakes, yes it has the most premium quartz movement they make inside, but would you ever consider getting one?

Moser & Cie., MB&F, Ulysse Nardin, and Urwerk after Baselworld and Watches and Wonders were canceled due to the pandemic, starts tomorrow. When you see all the exhibitors, it makes perfect sense that Louis Erard will also show up there in force, and they have already unveiled a pretty big heavy hitter for the event - the Petite Seconde Metropolis Louis Erard x The Horophile.\\n\\nFor years (actually, since 1929) Louis Erard was a solid, if relatively unknown, Swiss watchmaker. In the past several years, this has radically changed. Louis Erard is now, perhaps, one of the leading manufacturers of innovative, prestigious, even complicated watches for funny low prices. They have worked with the likes of Konstantin Chaykin to make an accessible Clown watch, they make incredible hand made marqueterie dials for some of their watches, they created an incredible monopusher with Massena Lab… And their latest collaboration is with Swiss-based watch influencer known as The Horophile (aka Amr Sindi) and using Louis Erard’s Petite Seconde.\\n\\nThe classic 39mm stainless steel case of the Petite Seconde was chosen for the “collection within the collection”. Although the three watches are limited to 59 pieces each (177 plus 1 for The Horophile), the idea is to create a base upon which other special editions can be built. The inspiration is Art Deco with a contemporary twist, a style Louis Erard head Manuel Emch and Sindi refer to as Neo Deco.\\n\\nThe watch comes in three colors - slate-grey, salmon and tobacco. The font of the numerals is double traced and very Art Deco, while the center of the dial is decorated with concentric grooves. The classic small seconds counter of the Petite Seconde is also reinterpreted here with strict minimalism – no indices, and a single dot at noon. The “Empire” hands enhance the Art Deco spirit of the watch and look like a 1930s New York skyscraper like the Empire State Building or the Chrysler building, with a stepped shape.\\n\\nInside the watch is the automatic elaboré grade Sellita SW261-1, a version of the SW-200, with an openworked rotor and black lacquered LE logo. The movement has a frequency of 28,800vph/4Hz, a power reserve of 38 hours when fully wound and features a stop-seconds mechanism. The watch comes with a grained calfskin strap.\\n\\nEach colorway, as noted, is limited to just 59 pieces and the retail price is CHF 2,300.

And most of them were fascinated with two huge tournaments - Roland-Garros and Wimbledon. For me, it was always the U.S. Open that had a certain sense of coolness about it. Not sure why, but I liked it the most. It seems that the folks from the brilliant tennis magazine Racquet, designed Carlton DeWoody and Zurich-based Maurice de Mauriac agree with me, as they are releasing a sequel to their Tennis watch, the Rallymaster II.\\n\\nUnfortunately, just a day after the trio announced the watch, Maurice de Mauriac sent out another piece of news, this one much more somber. Their founder Daniel Dreifuss has passed away after a prolonged battle with cancer. Read [**this obituary by Ariel Adams**](https://www.ablogtowatch.com/the-sad-passing-of-daniel-dreifuss-founder-of-zurichs-maurice-de-mauriac-watches/?utm_source=itsabouttime.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-expensive-citizen-with-a-black-washi-paper-dial-is-very-interesting-louis-erard-releases-another-great-art-deco-watch-maurice-de-mauriac-s-tennis-watch-is-weirdly-priced-new-watches-from-ifl-and-ba111od) from A Blog To Watch.\\n\\nBack to the Rallymaster II. This is a second limited edition which follows one released last summer to mark the French Open at Roland-Garros and this time comes in a pastel colorway. It’s basically the same watch as the first watch, with a 39mm wide case at 12mm thick, with a 47mm lug-to-lug measurement. The stainless steel case is fully brushed, which makes sense for a sporty watch, but what doesn’t make sense is the 30 meter water resistance that the watch has.\\n\\nThe dial comes in a light blue colorway with a texture inspired by the hardcourt surface of a tennis court. There’s a pattern that looks like a tennis court net across the dial from 3 to 9 o’clock, with a grey line only broken up by dial text running vertically from 6 to 12 o’clock simulating the lines of the service box. Around the dial is a rally-style minute rehaut, utilising white-on-grey tones that provide contrast while also matching the colours of the broader dial. A step within, raised and metallically framed circular hour indices surround the dial with the exception of the third and ninth hour. At 3 o’clock, you have a magnified cyclops date with a black-on-white disc, and the running seconds counter is at 9 o’clock. The running seconds has a yachting inspired separation into three sectors, each in a different colour: blue, pink, and grey. However, this separation has nothing to do with yachting, but rather is inspired by a previously held serve time limit rule of 20 seconds. This rule is no longer in place.\\n\\nInside the watch is the Swiss automatic Landeron 24 calibre, originally designed as an alternative to the workhorse ETA 2824. It is a reliable performer with 40 hours of power reserve and a 4Hz beat rate. It has a display caseback, despite the movement not being decorated, but the glass does feature a painted mid-century style tennis logo. The watch comes with two quick-release, two-piece stretch NATO-style straps in blue or pink.\\n\\nThese watches will have a limited production with pre-orders open for the duration of the U.S. Open which starts today and ends September 10. Now for the biggest issue with the watch. It is priced at CHF 1,950. This is quite a price to ask for a watch, but this has been an issue with a lot of Maurice de Mauriac watches - extremely high prices not backed up with any real quality or heritage.

They collective became known as IFL watches and they are most well known today for their customized Casio G-Shock, Tissot PRX, and Oris watches. And their latest release is perhaps their best Oris yet - the Oris Divers 65 Candyman. It is bright, it is fun, and it is still a proper water-going watch underneath its flashy exterior.\\n\\nIFL Watches has taken the 38mm Divers Sixty-Five “Cotton Candy” to use as a backdrop. This is a great watch with vintage looks, 100 meters of water resistance and powered by the Sellita SW200-1-based Oris caliber 733. The bracelet is constructed with real rivets, but all of that is not important. The original Cotton Candy line is already famous for their great dials, but IFL made it better by giving it to their in-house hand-enameler.\\n\\nThe result is the mascot Oris bear placed in a bright pink candy world, sprinkling candy. And while IFL describes this as “Thor, the Oris Bear, as he cheekily romps through a Candyland, his jovial smile outshining the timid candy character in the backdrop,” it’s pretty obvious that that’s a creepy bear stalking someone in the Candyland, so it’s not beyond reason to think that this is the original Candyman.\\n\\nIFL has made only 25 of these, and unfortunately, all of them are already sold out. But I still wanted you to see how great of a watch his was. The watch sold for €3,490, a €1,140 premium over the regular Cotton Candy.

They have made waves by producing the least expensive Swiss made tourbillon – the Ba111od Chapter 4.1, as well as the Ba111od Chapter 4.5 GMT Tourbillon. Their CHPTR\\\\_Δ has one of the most interesting ways of moving hands and displaying time, for a crazy low price, compared to pieces it competes with. Now they’re releasing a new collection - Chapter 6, completely aimed at women.\\n\\nI’ve been saying for some time now that there is a big gap in the market for afforable high quality watches from micro and indie brands that are aimed at women. And it seems that the people from Ba111od agree with me. A total of 5 models are released. All in 36mm steel cases, with two with additional gold PVD coating. The watches are released in 5 different colour options for the dial. All feature the crown at 4 o’clock, which is a Ba111od signature.\\n\\nThe design is quite a good looking watch, with an open aperture forming the upper part of the figure of 8 which dominates the dial. The time is displayed centrally and the hour/minute hands sweep across the entire dial surface. What you see inside is the Automatic Swiss Made SOPROD P024 Skeleton, which is a decent movement, again based on the ETA 2824. You can see the same movement, without the skeltonization in a lot of watches from Nivada Grenchen and Benrus.\\n\\nBa111od is also proud of their integration of NFC chips into their watches, most notably into the top crystal, but Chapter 6 comes with 2 NFC chips embedded in the leather bands of the watch, one of which can be used to store your business card or any other file you would like to share with others.\\n\\nThe best part of Ba111od watches is their value for money. They make complicated, interesting and great looking watches for not a lot of money. The same is true of the Chapter 6. The five new Ba111od Chapter 6 models have a retail price of CHF 625 for the steel models and CHF 650 for the models with yellow gold coating. You can get them right now [**from their website**](https://ba111od.com/collections/chapter-6?utm_source=itsabouttime.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-expensive-citizen-with-a-black-washi-paper-dial-is-very-interesting-louis-erard-releases-another-great-art-deco-watch-maurice-de-mauriac-s-tennis-watch-is-weirdly-priced-new-watches-from-ifl-and-ba111od).\\n\\n\\\\-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n# On hand - a selection of reviews\\n\\n**1/**\\n\\n[**Hands-On With The Chopard Mille Miglia Classic Chronograph In Steel And Gold**](https://www.fratellowatches.com/hands-on-with-the-chopard-mille-miglia-classic-chronograph-in-steel-and-gold/?utm_source=itsabouttime.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-expensive-citizen-with-a-black-washi-paper-dial-is-very-interesting-louis-erard-releases-another-great-art-deco-watch-maurice-de-mauriac-s-tennis-watch-is-weirdly-priced-new-watches-from-ifl-and-ba111od)\\n\\n**2/**\\n\\n[**A review of the cream-colored Cuervo y Sobrinos Historiador Hemingway Iconico**](https://www.ablogtowatch.com/hands-on-cuervo-y-sobrinos-historiador-hemingway-iconico-pointer-date-watch/?utm_source=itsabouttime.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-expensive-citizen-with-a-black-washi-paper-dial-is-very-interesting-louis-erard-releases-another-great-art-deco-watch-maurice-de-mauriac-s-tennis-watch-is-weirdly-priced-new-watches-from-ifl-and-ba111od)\\n\\n\\\\-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n# Watch Worthy - A look at an offbeat, less known watch you might actually like\\n\\n[**The Attitude is designed to be a tribute to military veterans without looking like every other field watch we’ve seen before**](https://www.ablogtowatch.com/watch-review-richard-harvey-attitude/?utm_source=itsabouttime.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-expensive-citizen-with-a-black-washi-paper-dial-is-very-interesting-louis-erard-releases-another-great-art-deco-watch-maurice-de-mauriac-s-tennis-watch-is-weirdly-priced-new-watches-from-ifl-and-ba111od)\\n\\nThe intricate chapter ring (secured by three visible screws) houses military-inspired numerals at the quarters while a triangle at 12 o’clock nods to more traditional pilot watches. A rehaut above it features additional markings, including numerals at five-minute intervals and small lume plots at 3, 6, 9, and 12 o’clock. The date at 4:30 will certainly polarize people, but there simply isn’t space for it at 3 o’clock or 6 o’clock. The dial has a lot going on, so it doesn’t stand out like it would on a dress watch or a watch with a lighter-colored dial.\\n\\n\\\\-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPeople loved the Seiko Midi giveaway!

But before we get there, IWC has managed to sneak in a surprise release, just on the eve of the event. Lumed dials have been having a bit of a moment as of late, and now IWC is getting in on the action, with their first pilot’s watch with a fully lumed dial treatment, the Pilot’s Watch Automatic 41 Black Aces.\\n\\nThis is a very familiar watch with a 41mm wide case that is 11.4mm thick. It’s case is black ceramic and is just a smidge larger than IWC’s signature pilot’s watch, the Mark XX. While I’m no fan of black cases, this black ceramic not only looks nice, it’s a really good contrast for the fully white dial. IWC points out that to make this dial they mix SuperLumiNova pigments with a binder, cast into a circular mold, and hardened to a ceramic-like durability. That solid disc is then fixed onto the soft-iron dial, before black printing is applied. According to them, the dial should have a greenish light for more than 23 hours.\\n\\nThis is a great looking watch, but the Black Aces patch at 6 o’clock is sure to bring up controversy. While it might be a selling point for aviation nerds, not everyone likes the branding of something they may be unfamiliar with being so prominent. That’s why most brands choose to put collaboration logos on the caseback. But if you were interested what the logo stands for, the Black Aces is the latest in an ongoing series of watches that IWC has made in partnership with US Navy squadrons as part of their Professional Pilot’s Watches Program. The watch is inspired by the actual watch that Strike Fighter Squadron 41, known as the Black Aces, has commissioned from IWC. This squadron has roots that date back to 1950, and is based at Naval Air Station Lemoore in California\\n\\nFrom all available information, this is joining the regular IWC lineup and will not be limited. You can get it now exclusively from the IWC website and it’s priced at $6,800.

Something you get as a tough beater, something that will give you great value for money and something you won’t have to fear banging on a doorsill. But, much like Seiko, Citizen also has a very robust offering of higher-end watches. At the very tip of that high end range is the infuriatingly named “The Citizen” collection - these are watches with premium movements, better quality materials and are, usually, limited to the Japanese market. However, Citizen just announced their latest addition to The Citizen collection will be coming to the United States, although I’m not sure about the rest of the world. It is called the The Citizen Eco-Drive Black Washi Paper Dial Limited Edition AQ4103-16E and it is unlike any other Citizen you have seen - in looks, in internals and definitely in price.\\n\\nThis Citizen is made out of Super Titanium with a bright yellow gold Duratect coating making it look, at least in photos, as if it’s actually made out of solid gold. Live, with the titanium lightness, I doubt you would mistake it for the precious metal, but it still looks good. The watch measures 38.3mm wide and 12.2mm thick, gets a double-domed sapphire crystal with anti-reflective treatment and a solid screw-down caseback is engraved with The Citizen collection’s signature eagle insignia. The same eagle appears on the tip of the signed crown at the 3 o’clock location, and right next to it on the side of the case is a small recessed pusher that is used during the setting process. .\\n\\nWhile the case is already a step up from the rest of the Citizen lineup, the real stunner is a dial. While I have only seen this in pictures, this looks like a dial that would easily find it’s place in a Grand Seiko limited edition. According to Citizen, the black washi paper dial is handcrafted by master papermakers and sprinkled with gold leaf using a traditional Japanese decorative technique called Sunago-maki. Keep in mind, this is a watch powered by an Eco-Drive solar-powered movement, so the semi-transparent nature of washi paper makes it ideal, while care must be taken when applying the gold leaf to not cover too much of the dial. Also, since this is a hand made dial, every single one is unique.\\n\\nSpeaking of the Eco-Drive… Inside is the brand’s Eco-Drive Caliber A060 high-accuracy solar quartz movement, their most premium movement. Just like the others, it can be powered by natural or artificial light and in energy-saving mode can run up to a year in darkness. The accuracy is as crazy as you would expect from a premium quartz movement and measures -/+5 seconds per year. You also get a perpetual calendar, low-power warning, and independently adjustable hour hand, along with automatic hand position adjustment. The watch comes on a premium two-piece black crocodile leather strap with gold contrast stitching running down either side and a gold colored deployant style clasp.\\n\\nThis is the highest level of Citizen you can buy, and it’s an interesting proposal. The Citizen line has had some great watches in the Japanese market, and now the rest of the world can see what they are doing. However, only 350 pieces will be made and they are priced at $3,800. That’s a hell of a lot of money for a quartz-powered Citizen. Yes it’s their most advanced watch, yes it has a hand-made paper dial with gold flakes, yes it has the most premium quartz movement they make inside, but would you ever consider getting one?

With it they opened themselves up to a completely new demographic with sporty and elegant timepieces that reach deep into JLC history for inspiration. And among the Polaris models, the Chronograph seems to be the most popular. Now Jaeger-LeCoultre is revealing two updates to the model, with brand new dials and a new movements.\\n\\nThe core design of the watch remains unchanged. It still comes in a steel case measuring 42mm wide and 13.4mm thick. It’s a simple vintage-inspired design, with a mix of brushed and polished finishes, taut lines, a thin bezel, sharp lugs, with a large crown that is a clear homage to the old Polaris models of the 60s, and a box style crystal.\\n\\nPrevious versions of the Polaris Chronograph came with black and blue sunray brushed dials. This update gets two new thickly lacquered dials (35 layers of hand-applied clear lacquer alone), adding a lot of depth to the textured and sunburst sections of the dial. The high-gloss gradient lacquer dials are framed by an opaline tachymeter chapter ring. The two colors are a warm grey and a deep blue, both with a panda look with contrasting matte black-grained subdials and orange accents that lean into the sportier heritage of the Polaris.\\n\\nThere’s also an update on the inside. You get the automatic Jaeger-LeCoultre 761 movement with a 65-hour power reserve. Like the very similar caliber 751, you still get hours, minutes, small seconds, a chronograph with a 30-minute counter and central seconds indication, and a column wheel. It also looks fantastic through the rear sapphire crystal as well. The warm gray Polaris chronograph comes on a great looking matching textile strap or a black rubber strap, while the blue features the brushed and polished stainless steel bracelet or blue rubber strap.\\n\\nThe new Jaeger LeCoultre Polaris Chronographs are priced at $14,300 USD for warm gray(reference Q902843J) on straps, and $14,800 USD for blue (ref. Q902818) on steel with a rubber strap.

Through it’s many iterations it has become one of the brand’s best sellers, but as a true field watch it always lacked one functionality - a proper GMT complication. There is no other complication that better fits the ethos of the field watch, meant for exploring and adventure in all parts of the world. To be fair, the Alpinist has had a GMT, but only in a quartz version. But today Seiko introduces their first mechanical GMT references to the Alpinist line called the Prospex SPB377 and SPB379.\\n\\nSeiko had big shoes to fill, as the quartz GMT Alpinist I mentioned has a bit of a cult following - back in 2003, Seiko made three versions of a GMT made out of titanium, with a super rare 500-piece SSASS limited edition for charity that is adored by fans. Go look these watches up, as they had a great design for the 24-hour scale that was placed between the regular hour markers, not something you see every day.\\n\\nBut for the two new versions, Seiko chose a more traditional approach to GMT time. We get two colors, the SPB377 with a blue dial and a blue leather strap and the SPB379 with a black dial and black leather strap. Both measure 39.5mm wide, 13.6mm thick, with a lug-to-lug of 46.4mm, and are made out of stainless steel this time. So, it appears to be a regular Alpinist, but changes are apparent on the dial. Unlike the regular Alpinist which has numerals on even hours and indices on the odd ones, this version has numerals at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o’clock. And unlike the previous GMT, this one has the 24-hour GMT scale integrated into the stainless steel bezel. You also get the usual compass scale on the rehaut that can rotated by operating the crown at 4 o’clock. The date window has moved from 3 o’clock to the worst spot - 4:30, but without the cyclops and neatly integrated into the look it doesn’t stand out as much to be an eyesore.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rb4ft55e1mb1.jpg?width=1102&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02c8cc1def2b38913370ea76519a2d24129e1d76\\n\\nBoth watches are powered by the new Seiko caliber 6R54, which also powers the recent GMT divers in the Prospex collection. This in-house automatic GMT movement operates at 21,600vph and gets 72 hours of power reserve. The new 6R54 allows you to set the 24-hour GMT hand independently, meaning it can be called an office GMT.\\n\\nThe SPB377 and SPB379 will be available as of October 1st, and both will have a list price of €1,200, about €500 less than the Prospex GMT divers with the same movement.

When you see all the exhibitors, it makes perfect sense that Louis Erard will also show up there in force, and they have already unveiled a pretty big heavy hitter for the event - the Petite Seconde Metropolis Louis Erard x The Horophile.\\n\\nFor years (actually, since 1929) Louis Erard was a solid, if relatively unknown, Swiss watchmaker. In the past several years, this has radically changed. Louis Erard is now, perhaps, one of the leading manufacturers of innovative, prestigious, even complicated watches for funny low prices. They have worked with the likes of Konstantin Chaykin to make an accessible Clown watch, they make incredible hand made marqueterie dials for some of their watches, they created an incredible monopusher with Massena Lab… And their latest collaboration is with Swiss-based watch influencer known as The Horophile (aka Amr Sindi) and using Louis Erard’s Petite Seconde.\\n\\nThe classic 39mm stainless steel case of the Petite Seconde was chosen for the “collection within the collection”. Although the three watches are limited to 59 pieces each (177 plus 1 for The Horophile), the idea is to create a base upon which other special editions can be built. The inspiration is Art Deco with a contemporary twist, a style Louis Erard head Manuel Emch and Sindi refer to as Neo Deco.\\n\\nThe watch comes in three colors - slate-grey, salmon and tobacco. The font of the numerals is double traced and very Art Deco, while the center of the dial is decorated with concentric grooves. The classic small seconds counter of the Petite Seconde is also reinterpreted here with strict minimalism – no indices, and a single dot at noon. The “Empire” hands enhance the Art Deco spirit of the watch and look like a 1930s New York skyscraper like the Empire State Building or the Chrysler building, with a stepped shape.\\n\\nInside the watch is the automatic elaboré grade Sellita SW261-1, a version of the SW-200, with an openworked rotor and black lacquered LE logo. The movement has a frequency of 28,800vph/4Hz, a power reserve of 38 hours when fully wound and features a stop-seconds mechanism. The watch comes with a grained calfskin strap.\\n\\nEach colorway, as noted, is limited to just 59 pieces and the retail price is CHF 2,300.

This new automatic calibre FC-735 debuts inside the Classic Power Reserve Big Date Manufacure and the three complications are a big date, a moon phase and a power reserve indicator. It’s a great new watch from a great brand and it comes in three wildly different materials with wildly different prices.\\n\\nThe case they use for the new movement is from its Classic family, which means that it measures 40mm wide and 12.19mm thick, with a fully polished finish. A dial with three complications sounds like it could be too crowded, but this one looks elegant with the big date located between 2 and 3 o’clock, the power reserve indicator is slightly recessed and placed on the left side of the dial while the moon phase indicator is at 6 o’clock with a silvery moon and stars set against a light blue sky. The slim applied hour markers and hands are diamond faceted and hand polished.\\n\\nThe watch comes in four variations: a limited edition of 35 platinum pieces with a dark blue meteorite dial and a matching matte navy blue alligator strap, a 350-piece edition in rose gold with a sun-brushed grey dial and a matte brown alligator strap, a non-limited edition in steel with a blue sun-brushed dial and a matte blue alligator strap and a non-limited edition in steel with a silver sun-brushed dial and a matte blue alligator strap.\\n\\nThe open caseback reveals the inner workings of the new automatic FC-735 Manufacture calibre with its openworked rotor and decorative perlage and Côtes de Genève finishings. Beating at a frequency of 28,800vph, the movement delivers a power reserve of 50 hours.\\n\\nPricing is, like I said, crazy on this model. The platinum version retails for EUR 25,995, the rose gold for EUR 17,995 and the non-limited steel models retail for EUR 4,795. While it’s crazy to say that a 26k watch is a good deal, it actually doesn’t sound that bad for such a limited model with an in house movement and platinum case. Where things get really crazy is the steel version - EUR 4,795 is a bargain for a watch like this.

Starting with the two elements that make it legible – the dauphine hands and applied markers. The hour and minute hands are polished and come with a rather large application of lume, while the second hand, also polished, showcases a red arrow tip – Argos’ inspiration here is of a compass needle. The polished hour markers are a mix of Arabics and indices, with numerals at the 3, 9, and 12 positions, and batons everywhere else. Instead of an hour marker at the 6, Argos opted for a framed date aperture with a white disc and black printed numerals.\\n\\n[**The Attitude is designed to be a tribute to military veterans without looking like every other field watch we’ve seen before**](https://www.ablogtowatch.com/watch-review-richard-harvey-attitude/?utm_source=itsabouttime.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-expensive-citizen-with-a-black-washi-paper-dial-is-very-interesting-louis-erard-releases-another-great-art-deco-watch-maurice-de-mauriac-s-tennis-watch-is-weirdly-priced-new-watches-from-ifl-and-ba111od)\\n\\nThe intricate chapter ring (secured by three visible screws) houses military-inspired numerals at the quarters while a triangle at 12 o’clock nods to more traditional pilot watches. A rehaut above it features additional markings, including numerals at five-minute intervals and small lume plots at 3, 6, 9, and 12 o’clock. The date at 4:30 will certainly polarize people, but there simply isn’t space for it at 3 o’clock or 6 o’clock. The dial has a lot going on, so it doesn’t stand out like it would on a dress watch or a watch with a lighter-colored dial.\\n\\n[**The UniDesign Model One mashes together classic Genta Design, an AP dial, some Cartier influences, a bit of Patek Phillipe and it all works out**](https://www.thetimebum.com/2023/08/unidesign-watch-co-model-one.html?utm_source=itsabouttime.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=seiko-releases-first-mechanical-gmt-alpinist-unimatic-works-with-revolution-on-distressed-blue-u1-bravur-completes-grand-tour-trio-new-watches-from-reservoir-ulysse-nardin-and-armin-strom)\\n\\nSo, while the case of the Model One is unusual, the dial is downright striking. Instead of the more typical grid or windowpane texture, the dial is comprised of a pattern of inset squares. Really, you have to see it to appreciate it. It’s distinctive without being overwhelming and creates a lot of depth on a watch that only measures 9.8mm thick. The applied numerals, thickly lumed with BWG9 Superluminova, float on top of the dial and give the Model One a sportier, more casual look than other watches in this segment thanks to using a “12” instead of a stick for the top marker. The beveled frame around the date window is a thoughtful touch, one that even established brands forget from time to time.\\n\\n\\\\-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPeople loved the Longines Spirit Zulu Time giveaway!

Then I picked it up to try it on after asking the boutique’s sales agent and wow, the dial is really, really cool imo. \\n\\nIt’s something I’m seriously looking at and am even comparing to the AP code 11.59 chrono in stainless steel with the blue dial. \\n\\nThe movement also looks a lot better in person than online I think so that’s cool too. The rubber strap isn’t great I think but you can easily change it anyway. \\n\\nIt’s got a dome sapphire crystal so that’s something to note whether one is a fan of it or not. I’m not really a fan of that but if it’s on my consideration list, I’ll certainly take a look at it several more times before deciding. The colour in your newsletter is also pretty unique and standout compared to some of the more traditional/used colours.', 'Love the newsletter, keep it coming \\nPlan to get a UniDesignWatch- love what some of the MicroBrands are doing tbh, makes getting a Rep make no sense', 'man why the 4 30 date window on the alpinist, legit probably my favourite watch, imo should have just stuck to date window at 3 and removed cyclops.', 'I have the earlier, 1/500, white dial version of that citizen (wearing it right now in fact), and it was like ⅔ the price earlier this year.

Anyway, in response to a simple question on Twitter, \"I play Fortnite on PC but would love to play it on my switch, are you interested in making it for the Switch?\", the Creative Director of EPIC Games, Donald Muster, replied with simply \"YES\". Although this isn\\'t direct confirmation, it could imply that they are actively searching for possible opportunities to develop their hugely popular title for the Switch platform. We\\'ll just have to wait to see if anything else is announced in the coming months and possibly E3. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **\"Image & Form\" and \"Zoink\" join together to create new company, \"Thunderful\"** - [Link (GamePress Members Only)](https://www.gamespress.com/release.asp?c=d87115--158314) - [RAW Imgur Link](https://imgur.com/a/dDDjo)\\n\\n> Image & Form, who are most well known for releasing the SteamWorld Dig series, and the developers Zoink, being the creators of upcoming Fe and other EA titles, have decided to join arms in creating a new gaming company under the handle, \"Thunderful\". This was announced in a Press Release which is available to see in Imgur link that I have attached in the links above. The 2 companies have collaborated for a long time, and will continue to develop games with existing and new IPs under their respective labels. CEO of Image & Form said, \"Through Thunderful we can share resources more effectively, officially act together and launch bigger, more ambitious game projects. We’re becoming a real powerhouse.\". I\\'m personally really excited to see what the company produces together and I\\'ll be sure to let you all know, when they announce something.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 has shipped over 500,000 copies. Free DLC till 11th February!** - [Link](https://twitter.com/dbgame_official/status/956388374465585153)\\n\\n> It was announced today, on the Dragon Ball Games official Twitter, that their most recent game released on the Switch platform, Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, has shipped an outstanding 500,000 copies! To celebrate this huge achievement, the developers have decided to give the \"Legend Patrol\" DLC for free until the 11th February. So I strongly suggest that if you own the game, to claim the free DLC while it is available for the next couple of weeks. You can read the full announcement in the link above. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night teased for the Switch** - [Link](https://www.facebook.com/bloodstainedrotn/videos/1319818578163861/)\\n\\n> In a wonderfully created Facebook video, developers of Blood Stained: Ritual of the Night, teased a Switch release. The video is pretty good so I suggest giving it a little watch, but in the comments to the video, they also announced that the game currently has a 2018 release, but that is subject to change depending on the development. After reading this, I\\'m pretty sure that we must assume that the development for this re-release is pretty early, so I wouldn\\'t be too surprised if a delay is announced to push it further in 2018 or even 2019.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Square Enix considering Secret of Mana remake for the Switch** - ORIGINAL SOURCE DOWN\\n\\n> In an interview with US Gamer Square Enix’s Masaru Oyamada announced when talking about a possible remaster release of the Secret of Mana for the Switch, “So, the voices are heard, we’re aware that people are desiring a Switch version, and we will make an effort to see what is feasible in the future, though nothing is confirmed or planned.”. Like the EPIC games consideration, this doesn\\'t mean that the remaster has been confirmed or set in stone. Instead it\\'s a simple want for the remaster that Square Enix are aware of an so are considering it as that makes good PR. However, this doesn\\'t mean that it won\\'t happen, we\\'ll just have to wait and find out!\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n# Game Announcements/Updates:\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **PixARK** - [Announcement](https://twitter.com/SnailGamesUSA/status/956594653222113282) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tnt6epYpLAs) - Late 2018\\n\\n> An incredibly surprising announcement today was the tease for a game called PixARK. When I first saw it, I thought it was just a cheap clone of the popular ARK Survival Evolved, however I noticed that it is actually an officially licensed spin-off of the original set in the same universe. After looking through the gameplay, that can be found in the trailer above, it looks incredibly similar to CubeWorld...which I believe is dead, but it may not be, let me know. Anyway, this title looks pretty good, but there is currently very little information about it and so I\\'m just awaiting more news and info. before getting too excited about the game. I\\'ve just realised that they are probably developing this, because they realised that the poorly optimised ARK Survival Evolved would *never* run on the Switch...\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Flinthook** - [Announcement](https://twitter.com/TributeGames/status/956576217586651136) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OeZn9It1TA) - \"More details coming soon\"\\n\\n> Also in the same day, publishers Limited Run Games, announced that the incredibly popular Flint Hook will be arriving onto the Switch at some point in the near future. There currently isn\\'t any details concerning the re-release, but on Twitter the developers said that more details will be coming soon. There is a brand new trailer available to view in the link above, but it doesn\\'t seem to reveal any unique qualities between the regular edition and the Switch release. As per usual, I\\'ll keep you all posted when more news becomes available.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Castle of Heart** - [Website](http://www.castleofheart.com/) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lHcwLsnHvs) - Q1 2018\\n\\n> This title is actually a brand new game that will be exclusively released onto the Switch platform. On their website, developers 7Levels, say that Castle of Heart is \"a classic action platformer at the genre’s best… and most challenging, with plentiful of new twists on formula to experience. The players take control over a cursed knight, turned to stone by the evil sorcerer’s spell, but ready to prove that love and courage can conquer even the darkest magic. The brave hero must travel all the way from the petrified village to the dark ruler’s castle, mastering 20 levels set in 4 distinct environments – full of enemies who require different strategies to face them successfully and sudden gameplay changes, which translate to exciting, dynamic action sequences.\". As this is an exclusive, I\\'ll definitely be keeping my eye out, for when more news is announced; especially a trailer that isn\\'t just 16 seconds of teaser. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Dead Cells** - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F72iuLGVfCQ) - TBD\\n\\n> Unfortunately, this is another game announcement that doesn\\'t have much news concerning it. The only piece that I have to show you is the announcement trailer that was actually released onto the official Nintendo YouTube channel. Also like the Flinthook trailer, this trailer doesn\\'t disclose any new features that will be included in the Switch version of the game. In case you are unaware, on Steam, Dead Cells is, \"a rogue-lite, metroidvania action-platformer. You\\'ll explore a sprawling, ever-changing castle... assuming you’re able to fight your way past its keepers in 2D souls-lite combat. No checkpoints. Kill, die, learn, repeat.\". Quite a worrying detail to say, is that this game is currently in Early Access, so unless the 1.0 update will arrive before the Switch is released, we might be getting games released onto the platform that aren\\'t even finished.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **RunGunJumpGun** - [Announcement](https://twitter.com/GoodShepherdEnt/status/956268647298879489) - [eShop Link](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/atomik-rungunjumpgun-switch) - 8th February 2018\\n\\n> Today it was announced that RunGunJumpGun, developed by Gambitious and published by Good Shepherd, will be coming to the Switch platform on the 8th February 2018. On the eShop the game is described as, \"a tough as nails 2D Action Platformer that puts a teeth-rattling, gravity-defying weapon in your hands. With a cast of crazed characters, simple but beautifully difficult gameplay, and a pulsing musical score, ATOMIK: RunGunJumpGun is a loud, trippy mess of twitchy platforming goodness.\". The current price $7.99, but that is obviously subject to change as we arrive close to the release date. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Mercenary Kings** - [Announcement](https://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames/status/956573654506201088) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgp8kMpEq58) - 6th February 2018\\n\\n> Limited Run Games have gotten rather good at surprise announcing titles onto the Switch and today is no different. It was announced today that Mercenary Kings: Reloaded Edition will be arriving on the Switch platform on the 6th February 2018. On Steam, it says, \"Craft your arsenal to avenge your fallen comrades and save the world from the fearsome forces of CLAW!\". If that isn\\'t too obvious, the game looks like a side-scrolling action platformer. This re-release onto the Switch platform will have 2 new characters, and will also feature new weapons and gear. In case anyone has the original title on Steam or PS4, the Reloaded Edition will come as a FREE update to those users.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Hello Kitty Kruisers** - [Announcement (GamesPress Members only)](https://www.gamespress.com/release.asp?c=884ca2--158255) - [RAW Imgur Link](https://imgur.com/a/wNgxQ) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruQ5Gc0S_Ls) - Spring 2018\\n\\n> I believe all of us are on the hype train for this one. With a brand new trailer and official press release, it was announced today that Hello Kitty Kruisers, a mario-kart style title, will be coming to the Switch platform in Spring 2018. I don\\'t think there is much else to say...except, \"Start your engines, Hello Kitty fans!\" - Trailer Description\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Rhythm Doctor** - [Announcement](https://www.bemanistyle.com/2018/01/23/exclusive-nintendo-switch-provides-pulse-rhythm-doctor/) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTFOO13CKSY) - \"Later in 2018\"\\n\\n> In an exclusive article with bemanistyle, it was announced that 7th Beat Games will be bringing Rhythm Doctor to the Switch platform, \"Later in 2018\". On Steam, Rhythm Doctor is, \"a rhythm game in a world where defibrillating patients\\' hearts in sync with their heartbeats has healing properties. Slam your spacebar in perfect time on the 7th beat, and they might just come out okay. But beware - every patient has unique illnesses based on complex music theory: polyrhythms, hemiolas, irregular time signatures...if you don\\'t know what they mean, don\\'t worry. Rhythm Doctor is designed to make you learn music and rhythm theory without even realising it!\". I am quite a fan of difficult skill based rhythm games, so I\\'ll probably be picking this up when it drops.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n#### **Wild Guns RELOADED** - [Announcement](https://twitter.com/natsume_inc/status/956559974225862656) - Spring 2018\\n\\n> On Twitter today, developers Natsume Inc. announced, \"Saddle up partners, we’re riding onto a new console!  The arcade shooter Wild Guns RELOADED is heading to Nintendo Switch in both North America and Europe this Spring.  Yeehaw!  Keep watching our Twitter for more details~\". This game was originally released on Steam and since it\\'s release on the 11th July 2017, it\\'s received 99 reviews with 90% of them being positive. The game is described as, \"a fast-paced arcade-style shooter, mixing the Wild West with steampunk. Play as Clint, Annie, Doris, or Bullet the dog with his sentry drone. Grab some friends and play together for some four player action!\". I don\\'t know of many on-rail shooters on the Switch, so it\\'ll be interesting to check this out. After writing this, I\\'m sure there will be one and you will all correct me in the comments below...\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n# Top Reddit Posts:\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n* My dad made a Switch design based on Super Princess Peach. - [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/7ssw6w/my_dad_made_a_switch_design_based_on_super/) - **u/Gogamego**\\n\\n* Am I the only one who secretly loves the madness that comes after a \"leak\" for a direct? - [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/7sw68t/am_i_the_only_one_who_secretly_loves_the_madness/) - **u/SwitchModsHaveNoPeen**\\n\\n* Sick of how boring the Nintendo Switch eShop looks, so I made a new one. - [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/7szmra/sick_of_how_boring_the_nintendo_switch_eshop/) - **u/OcheReddit**\\n\\n* GF made me a Switch dock cover. - [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/7svj53/gf_made_me_a_switch_dock_cover/) - **u/TimmoUK**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**If there are any errors or missed information, just let me know and I\\'ll add it promptly.**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n# Closing Statement:\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nWell I\\'ve hit a new late spot, after releasing this at a rather tiring 01:52AM. I would have released it earlier, but if it isn\\'t apparent by the incredibly long post, there has been quite a lot of news, announcements and releases. This is probably been the biggest day for actually writing and so that is the reason why it took a little longer, I\\'m sure you can forgive me. Anyway, some incredible surprises today with an exclusive being announced in the form of Castle of Heart and a couple of exciting ports like, \"Flinthook\" and \"Dead Cells\". Today also saw the release of Celeste, which seems to be doing pretty well for itself, receiving a perfect 10/10 for a large range of huge review outlets. I\\'ll need to get around to playing that at some point.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAnyway, thanks to all the reddit users who have given me permission to use their posts from earlier yesterday!\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI need sleep now...so I\\'m going to sleep...for a whole 5 HOURS!...I\\'ll cope...night!\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Sam ;)**\\n\\n&nbsp;', 'comments': ['14 releases, 9 new game announcements, and 5 pieces of significant news.
