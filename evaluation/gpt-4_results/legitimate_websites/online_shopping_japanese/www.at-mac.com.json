Yes, you read that right, all 5 star reviews despite only being available since September 15, 2017.\\n\\nAs soon as I read the name and rating, my bullshit meter went ding dong and I got extremely curious on how they have acheived such high ranking? Let\\'s dig a bit.\\n\\n----------------\\n\\nThe name is \"One Night Stand - Adult Hook up Tonight\" - if Ashley Maddison\\'s \"Have an affair\" was too bold for you, this isn\\'t that bad. Who doesn\\'t want to have instant sex at a moment\\'s notice with a complete stranger right? But any how, I digress. Let\\'s move on to the app icon. Sure beauty is subjective but I would expect such a top rated dating app to have a bit better looking icon.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at the promotional text: \"Looking for someone who wanna find a dating with top hot singles and love adventures. Find the real dates online. Help you hook up with the one you interested in.\"\\n\\nI am an immigrant and English isn\\'t my first language. But I am pretty sure there\\'s a ton of grammatical errors in this. App claims \"real dates\". ROFL. \"Top hot singles\" & \"love adventures\". LMFAO.\\n\\n----------------\\n\\nLet\\'s read the description. I am going to trim this down a bit because I can only handle bullshit to a limit. \\n\\n*\"If you are a good talker, maybe you can hookup with someone on a beautiful night. Drag your photos & fill in your profile, with a click of mouse, you can check the one you like and chat with him/her directly. Start a chat freely since it’s your time to show and you may meet the one you like and hookup now.\"*\\n\\n**Click of a mouse eh. I didn\\'t know Apple replaced the headphone jack with a fucking mouse.**\\n\\n*\"Get ready to a new dating with someone you like, enjoy chatting with him/her or dive into the world of passion and desire. All you need is our app One Night Stand. Search One Night Stand in iTunes now and be ready for a new life here. meet your fate one\\nStill shame to share your expression with others? Wanna make yourself more attractive? Eager to meet someone you like and wanna hookup with him/her directly. One Night Stand is your best choice. With all benefits above, you can enjoy more while you wanna hookup with someone.\\nFind the real one online, meet the one you like nearby & One Night Stand will help you hook up with the one you interested in.\\nNow, download it, and then meet the one you love!\"*\\n\\n**MAN, I AM SOOOO GETTING LAID TONIGHTTTT!!! Just gotta buy this 1 Week at 19.99 USD in app purchase and I will make all kinds of \"love adventures\" with the \"top hot singles\". Or maybe I will go for the 3 months at 69.99 USD. 69 nomsayin ;)**\\n\\n*\"As our app enables the display of users\\' locations on a map, to help you find users nearby you, and before display your information, we would request for your permission, you have right to reject it and don’t use the feature, if you turn on the location sharing, then keep an eye on unfriendly person and fake information.\"*\\n\\n**I am no rocket scientist but I am sure this app is the definition of \"fake information\".**\\n\\n----------------\\n\\nLet\\'s move on to the reviews. I don\\'t like the iOS 11 app store review system, so I use Appannie to look at all the reviews.\\n\\nThe app has received a total of 68,066 reviews since inception. \\nI sorted them to show \"5 star only\". I am a developer myself and my mind was absolutely blown with \\t67,882 all 5 star reviews. Man, even Apollo for Reddit has only received a total of 3800 reviews with only 3100 5 star reviews. So this dating app must be exceptionally good. /s\\n\\nLet\\'s look at the name of the last few reviewers:\\nMaria84, 7Linda, 84Peter, Howard35, 61Nicola, Boyle33, Geoffrey93, Jones24, 66Celeste, Maggie42, Doyle19, 46Letitia,  18Michelle.\\n\\nAnyone notice a pattern in these names? It\\'s like someone left a phone directory inside a for loop.\\n\\n----------------\\n\\n**Let\\'s read a few of them:**\\n\\n*Thank you for trying your best to make one night stand a safe, fun app.Stay happy, developers! -  Betsy Scripps63*\\n\\n*Thank you for trying your best to make one night stand a safe, fun app.Stay happy, developers! - Gerald Watt*\\n\\n*Overall good app, really helps meet new people, and build relationships. - 46Letitia MacAdam*\\n\\n*Overall good app, really helps meet new people, and build relationships. - gZachary*\\n\\n*As soon as I sign up, I swipe to the cute girl.

Thug ytjtffb thug*\\n\\n*bumbles Is amazing*\\n\\n----------------\\n\\nNo, I didn\\'t make a typo pasting the same review twice. That\\'s the same exact text, down to the typos reviewed by hundreds of different people within a few minutes. There\\'s hundreds of reviews which start with the exact same first few lowercase characters, then a random word in upper case. There\\'s another pattern of pasting some other popular app\\'s name in the review - probably for ASO (App store optimization) purposes to get better ranking in the store. Some reviewers claim to get 9 month long relationships from a 3 month old **\"one night stand\"** app.\\n\\nNow, sure, there are real reviews too which are all 1 star reviews warning everyone else about the scam but 3000 1 star real reviews easily get overpowered by 67000 5 star fake ones.\\n\\n----------------\\n\\nLet\\'s look at the screenshots. App uses pictures of attractive women as you would expect from most dating apps. However let\\'s dig a bit deeper. I downloaded the screenshots and did a reverse google search with them. These pictures are straight up stolen from someone\\'s instagram profile and other chive articles with titles \"Sometimes you gotta let them breathe\" with pictures of women with big tits.\\n\\n----------------\\n\\nNext let\\'s estimate the downloads and revenue for this app. For this, we go use SensorTower. For November, it estimates 70,000 downloads and $200,000 revenue. Now I know that sensor tower estimations aren\\'t that accurate but for an app which is #26 in the store, I won\\'t be surprised if this number were actually close enough. Considering this app has been available since September 15th and Christmas is when apps get the most revenue, I won\\'t be surprised if they had scammed half a million by taking advantage of gullible people.\\n\\n**EDIT:**\\n \\nMore about accuracy of Sensor Tower estimates as explained by /u/drysart here:\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7mzib4/how_to_scam_200000_per_month_and_get_67882_all_5/dry1fw0/?st=jbt3zziy&sh=51109789\\n\\nand by a Sensor Tower employee /u/dizietzz here:\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7mzib4/how_to_scam_200000_per_month_and_get_67882_all_5/dry5eir/?st=jbt67j93&sh=bca18e9a\\n\\n----------------\\n\\nI downloaded the app to test it and no surprises, was bombarded with a ton of fake messages from obviously fake \"milfs\".

Can we also please discuss the completely broken rating system and how such app has been available on the store for over 3 months despite being reported countless times and despite getting thousands of fake 5 star reviews?\\n\\nThere were a few other posts couple months ago about apps claiming to be antivirus software but were just scam. This proves disparity in the app review system for legitimate apps vs such scam apps. \\n\\n**Proposed solutions:**\\n\\n1.\\tHave some trigger which auto flags any app which is climbing up the rankings or getting too many reviews too fast and then have some human manually verify it?\\n2.\\tFlag reviews which have the same text.\\n3.\\tIf an app has a subscription model OR very expensive pricing, pay extra attention while reviewing the app.\\n4.\\tPay attention when reviewing apps and shit like “click of a mouse”, “Drag photos”, “Play store” should be easy to identify scams. When I submit my apps, they go through extreme scrutiny and often get rejected for silly stuff (example: Restore button not available for IAP - even though it actually is, App was rated 9+ and should be higher even though I rated the app 17+). So I wonder how these ones get through. \\n5.\\tWhy is reporting an app so hard on iOS? I can’t find a report button anywhere on the app page. Ended up using the support website to report it. \\n6.     iOS 11 App store has no way to sort/filter reviews. So if you look at this app, it ONLY shows you the 5 star ratings ONLY. Completely hides the 1 star reviews which deceives the consumer. The app store should have a filter for sorting by time/rating, filtering by number of stars, should let you see other reviews from the same user etc.\\n\\n\\n**EDIT:** Check out a google docs data dump of all the reviews here:\\n\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wPKwLd8BIX3AFVFkSFQcPqqYMKBUd19StG_UT24s_tc/edit?usp=sharing\\n\\n**EDIT:** Few people are asking me why I went through such extent to expose this? I did network security in school, so this is up my alley. Plus, I am a developer and make my living off of the app store, so this kind of stuff personally impacts me. Maybe I am jealous that a shady app is taking a spot in the top rankings which could be taken by real apps and also reducing the trust of regular people in the app store and making them skeptical about legitimate apps and in app purchases too. So when they would come across one of my legitimate apps with legitimate 5 star reviews, they would be skeptical. This stuff erodes the trust in a marketplace and should be exposed. Is it bad then that I am frustrated and outraged? You tell me.\\n\\n~~**EDIT:** Just woke up to somehow getting banned from posting in iosprogramming subreddit without a reason.

Having sunk around 100 hours into the game since its launch, and with the city of Baldur’s Gate still a distant sight, it’s a challenge to tear myself away from the captivating narrative I’ve woven.

It represents one of the closest approximations of true freedom, creativity, and player choice available, evolving concepts and mechanics that have been tinkered with for decades. Using Dungeons & Dragons as its catalyst, Larian has honored the past and forged a new future for a genre that has allowed increased agency for players to put their thoughts, feelings, hopes, and wants inside of a digital realm and live. Like every other player, my experience with Baldur’s Gate 3 is significantly anecdotal, ripe with unique stories about what happened to me that would take hours to share. But why listen to me when you can become lost in one of the most richly beautiful worlds ever created and make up your own tale?\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**[EIP Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/808/eip-gaming)** - Passion - [8 / 10](https://eip.gg/bg3/reviews/baldurs-gate-3/)\\n\\n>Larian Studios has truly managed to strike gold with Baldur\\'s Gate, managing to satisfy old trends and innovate with new ones.

Its complexity is intimidating, but sticking with it and learning has such a high reward threshold that it\\'s hard to not recommend the sequel to even the most casual gamers out there. It has heart, it has style, and it has the multi-year effort of a studio that obviously loves its source material. The mind-blowing size of the game itself and everything contained within is a testament to Larian Studios\\' dedication to its craft and commitment to bringing something incredible to the gaming public. The blend of the various Dungeon & Dragons systems into the game is almost flawless in its execution, and the math and storytelling combo does a one-two punch on almost every other RPG game out there.

I feel bad for Starfield at this point and for game developers in general. Larian Studios has set the bar incredibly high. Still, I hope other publishers will see it as an example to let developers have time and creative freedom to make incredible games without all the bloated live service and microtransaction bullshit. Also, you can play this game in four-player online co-op or even split-screen locally on a single PC, and in this day and age, that may be one of the most impressive features in BG3.

It’s gargantuan, intricate, complex and utterly unwilling to treat anyone softly and Larian don’t seem overly worried that this may put people off.

It’s an experience that’s like no other that will have you immersed for every second of play. Unfortunately, there are certain elements that hold it back from greatness. For starters, retreading already-explored areas for side quests and materials is a pain. Getting from point A to point B is a hassle that requires a great deal of time or coin because of the lack of a competent traversal system. On top of that, this could have immensely benefited from cooperative play. It already has multiplayer functions, so it’s disappointing we only got asynchronous gameplay, especially considering a pawn’s AI can be lacking outside of combat and their mouths do not stop moving. With that said, combat is highly engaging, the structure of the open world encourages exploration like nothing else and lack of hand holding is the best choice Capcom could have made. Dragon’s Dogma 2 has all the right to be the Elden Ring of 2024, but unfortunately, it’s held back by technical limitations and bizarre design choices. Despite this, there’s still so much brilliance to be found.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**[Hey Poor Player](https://opencritic.com/outlet/385/hey-poor-player)** - [Shane Boyle](https://opencritic.com/critic/8689/shane-boyle) - [4.5 / 5](https://www.heypoorplayer.com/2024/03/20/dragons-dogma-2-review-ps5/)\\n\\n>Dragon’s Dogma II is an instant classic. Capcom hasn’t reinvented the wheel here, opting instead to deliver the same blend of exploration and monster slaying that they established in 2012 while turning it into a full-on adventure simulator via a sandbox that is capable of generating jaw-dropping moments at every turn. It may not be polished to the degree that I’d like, but I find it impossible to be angry at Capcom when what they’ve delivered carries a level of ambition and seamlessness that needs to be seen to be believed. In a year stacked to the rafters with game-of-the-year-worthy RPGs already, Dragon’s Dogma II is another fantastic addition to what is already becoming a complicated discussion and should not be overlooked.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**[Hobby Consolas](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas)** - [Álvaro Alonso](https://opencritic.com/critic/3755/-lvaro-alonso) - *Spanish* - [94 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-dragons-dogma-2-ps5-xbox-series-xs-pc-1373611)\\n\\n>If you miss the days when playing video games was about sharing experiences and secrets with your friends and games where every step was a discovery, then look no further: Dragon\\'s Dogma 2 is the game with the most heart you\\'ll find.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Jarrett Green](https://opencritic.com/critic/5288/jarrett-green) - [8 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-review)\\n\\n>More of a redo than a sequel, Dragon\\'s Dogma 2 is a strange and wonderful action-RPG that bolsters the original’s strengths without addressing its weaknesses.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**[IGN Italy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/477/ign-italy)** - [Alessandra Borgonovo](https://opencritic.com/critic/3960/alessandra-borgonovo) - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10](https://it.ign.com/dragons-dogma-2/209348/review/dragons-dogma-ii-la-recensione)\\n\\n>Dragon\\'s Dogma II is both a blessing and a curse for fans of the genre and the series itself.

Whether battling fearsome monsters or unraveling the mysteries of Gransys, I found myself drawn into a journey of epic proportions — one that I expect will leave a lasting impression long after the final credits roll.

Hogwarts Legacy offers a serious mystery story that could quickly form the basis for another book in the Harry Potter world. It also often provides humorous situations that aren\\'t just fan service. At the same time, it is not a fairy tale. The story isn\\'t afraid to be morbid and doesn\\'t hide the fact that the wizarding world is full of danger. The game manages to captivate as much as it disappoints but in a balanced way.

Fortunately, and as far as I am, the game manages to forge its path incredibly well, adding in a few canonical elements, such as ancient magic.

It’s a game that should be experienced, even by those who aren’t Potter fans at all.\\n\\n-------------', 'comments': ['Arent the release dates of old gen incorrect in this post?', \"There's no possibility to pause cut scenes.

He’s been vigorously applying to stuff since, with varying degrees of success. \\n\\nThis listing didn’t show a salary range. Red flag #1. \\n\\nHe was still curious, since it was an at-home data entry job. He got called this morning by a lady while I was still asleep (he’s the early bird, I’m the night owl) and spent two hours being “interviewed”. He asked about the salary and she said it was “commission-based”.

Hubby hangs up in a rage, realizing he lost two hours of his life he’ll never get back. He immediately reports the listing as a scam to Indeed. \\n\\nWhen recounting it to me just now, he says that he did a quick google search of the company she claimed to represent, and it’s legit. I told him, “Yeah — but they’re counting on you doing that to make you believe the job is legit as well. Any links they provide you will be created by the scammers and mocked up to look like the company’s.” \\n\\nHim: “And I’d be stuck with new equipment I don’t need.”\\n\\nMe: “Heh. Bold of you to assume it’ll arrive at ALL.” \\n\\nHe also looked at the email they’d sent him and kicked himself for not noticing it didn’t come from “@legitcompany (dot) com”, it came from some other random, unaffiliated email server. That would’ve been another red flag. \\n\\nHe’s angry that he lost two hours of his time — but even more enraged that these scammers are preying on people who’re probably already in moderate-to-dire financial straits and leaving them in an even worse condition.
