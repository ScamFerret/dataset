I said before I\\'d make a more light hearted post than the usual fanfare of scamming and death threats threats and here we are. I hope you enjoy this write up, and if you want to find the fanfic being discussed here you can find it on [fanfiction.net](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://fanfiction.net/) [here](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9340263/2/My-Inner-Life) or [this](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1xdITMDE_I) dramatic reading on youtube.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n**1: What the legend of Zelda / Ocarina of time?:**\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nThe legend of Zelda is a series of fantasy games published by Nintendo for a variety of their consoles, from the NES to the Nintendo switch. The game series is extremely popular, and next to Mario and Pokémon is one of Nintendo\\'s most well known franchises.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nOcarina of time is a Zelda game which was originally released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998, and then again for the 3ds in 2011. The games plot is simple; the protagonist, Link, is a child who goes to collect 3 spiritual stones for princess Zelda in order to reach the sacred realm and take the triforce before the bad guy, Ganondorf, can take them. This does not work and Ganon takes over, leading to Link being sent 7 years into the future and using the ocarina of time to travel back and forth from childhood to adulthood to kick Ganon\\'s ass.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**2: What is lucid dreaming?:**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLucid dreaming is when a person is aware they\\'re dreaming, and can often control what they do or what happens in the dream. Lucid dreams can be spontaneous or induced.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Part 1: \"My inner life\" is published:**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBefore getting into the fic itself, I\\'d like to note here that finding out the date this thing was published is quite hard (if anyone reading this knows please let me, I will edit this post as soon as I can!). While some sources state the fic was written in the late 90s there are references in the authors note to Majoras mask (which was released in 2000), and oracle of seasons (which was released in 2001). This would place the publication sometime after February 2001. Though the fact that the author Jenna responds to comments means the authors note was written after the fic itself, so who knows. The authors note and the prologue are both ungodly long and pretentious, so I will go through the main points here: Jenna played ocarina of time and became quite attached to Link, which led to a series of vivid lucid dreams about the life they had together. This is the basis of *My inner life*. The fic itself has an interesting plot: Jenna, our lovely protagonist, meets link and immediately falls in love with his [long sexy ears](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9340263/4/My-Inner-Life). The rest of the plot includes marriage, babies, [many](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9340263/6/My-Inner-Life) [many](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9340263/9/My-Inner-Life) bad sex scenes and bizarre plot lines such as Jenna and Link having sex while pregnant to make the baby stronger (this is not scientifically accurate). Jenna is also given the ocarina of time and is revealed to be from a race of people who can control the elements. The plot is absolutely insane and I cannot recommend it enough.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Part 2: The backlash (and infamy):**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter the fic was published in all its glory, backlash inevitably ensued. It\\'s hard to find specific examples from this time due to not knowing the date it was published and a lot of this being deleted. The wayback machine also unfortunately didn\\'t have much. The earliest example I can find of people responding to the fic is [this](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/linksqueen.tripod.com/fic.html) 2006 website dedicated to the story and Jenna. However the fic quickly rose to infamy as being one of the worst fanfictions ever written; a tv tropes [page](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyInnerLife), wiki [page](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://myinnerlife.fandom.com/wiki/My_Inner_Life), some dramatic readings and [sporkings](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://zelda-queen.livejournal.com/tag/my%20inner%20life) on livejournal ensued. The pictures on these pages are of the CDI Zelda series, which MIL was unfavourably compared to (the CDI Zelda series is also infamous for being terrible among the fandom). Accusations of Jenna being a Mary Sue and a rather obvious self insert, making Link incredibly OOC and being a misogynist for making all the female characters lives revolve around Jenna and Link were also included. The fact Link would technically have the mind of an eleven year old according to the games canon while having sex with Jenna was brought up. Jenna also responded to the haters, which was pretty hilarious. One stand out moment was Jenna taking a comment which said updating the fic hurts people to explain that she has, in fact, not physically assaulted this person. [This](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://www.fanfiction.net/r/9340263/0/1/) [fanfiction.net](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://fanfiction.net/) page includes just some of the reviews for *My inner life* (most of them are negative). As for why this fanfic in particular got so popular amongst a sea of mediocre Zelda stories being posted to the internet at the time, my guess is that the author was very serious about this fic and about her life with link. While other bafic such as *My immortal,* *Forbidden fruit: The temptation of Edward Cullen* and the many other *My immortal* clones out there were considered troll fics by most people, Jenna seemed very real and sincere in her attempts at writing. The fact Jenna wasn\\'t the best at taking criticism also probably added to the rise in fame *My inner life* had.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Part 3: \"My inner life\" is deleted:**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAgain I can\\'t find the specific date this happened, but *My inner life* was sadly deleted. Like other badfics MIL ended on a cliffhanger without a proper ending, but the story of Jenna and Link lives on in the hearts of many fans. MIL is still well known, with [fanart](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://chelsearhi.tumblr.com/post/165881173448/confession-time-my-inner-life-is-my-favorite) still being posted in 2017. And chances are if you ask a Zelda fan, or just someone who was around for the rise of badfic in the early 2000s for some examples, MIL will appear. As for what happened to Jenna, sadly much like the other people I\\'ve done write ups on it\\'s hard to find what she\\'s doing today. I did find [these](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://www.deviantart.com/comments/4/419937/2448340439) [comments](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://fanlore.org/wiki/My_Inner_Life) from DevaintART and [fanfiction.net](https://archive.vn/o/ukhOS/https://fanfiction.net/) of someone who claimed to be Jenna saying she\\'s quite embarrassed by the fic, and a lovely user on here commented that the devianART account is Jenna\\'s as it features fanart from her previous fics.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd that\\'s where theory of MIL ends. The fanfic has gone down in history as being one of the worst fanfics to grace the inernet, and while Jenna may be ashamed of it MIL provided hours of entertainment for fans. I hope you enjoyed this write up and please let me know if there\\'s anything that should be corrected.

I don\\'t like bad fic that everyone loves, because that seems to build this sort of gravity well wherein it completely changes fanon and everything starts to revolve around people\\'s fanon of those characters, even when half the people in the conversation don\\'t like the ship represented.  (And it feels like there\\'s always a ship in those fics.  And yes, I\\'m thinking of a specific fic in a specific fandom, but honestly, this can be applied to a bunch of different places and works.)  So then you get really annoying circular arguments about characters because everyone\\'s actually having completely different conversations without realizing it.\\n\\nBut I really like the bad ones that are bad and everyone knows they\\'re bad, because they solidfy a fandom a little bit, but also they\\'re such a beautiful learning experience and exercise for baby readers and writers.  \"Look at this drek.

I\\'d read really good words, and I\\'d read REALLY bad words, and I\\'d take notes on what worked and try to analyze why, and I got better over time.\\n\\nBut also I just love bad fic because it exists.

Planning to move to Denmark from Ireland (EU citizens) this year. I have a few questions, sorry if it was answered before. Maybe there is some guide with all those things?\\n\\n1. EU Residence document/registration. How long does it take? Do I need to have the rental situation sorted first, or can I do it while looking for an apartment and living in an Airbnb? Is it all digital, or do I need to come physically to some registration place? How long does it take?\\n\\n2. Do I need to open an account in a Danish bank if I have a Revolut? Could someone recommend a good bank? Do I need to wait for the \"residence document\" first before opening an account in a Danish bank?\\n\\n3. Rental. Looking for anything in a 30–40-minute drive from Copenhagen doesn\\'t have to be within the city, so I assume there are more options. The problem is we have a dog. But is it a big deal? How long it normally takes to find a place to rent? I\\'ve read that it\\'s more reliable to rent from a company than private landlords to avoid scams, is it so? What are the best websites to look for rentals? I know there is [boligportal.dk](https://boligportal.dk), but I\\'ve read there are very creative scammers.\\n\\n4. Childcare. Looking to have a 1 y. o. placed in a daycare as soon as possible. In Ireland, we\\'ve been on a waitlist for a while! I\\'ve read that it\\'s different in DK and doesn\\'t take longer than 2 months, and under some circumstances can even get into a priority waitlist.\\n\\n5. A car. How long can I drive my Irish-registered vehicle in Denmark?\\n\\n6. Child benefits. Do EU citizens get child benefits? I know there is a child benefit, but I didn\\'t quite understand if I need to work for a while first, or if EU nationals are automatically qualified.\\n\\n7. Mother and Baby (1 year old). This one is important. My wife is attending several social gatherings and activities for new moms (like mom/baby pilates, breastfeeding groups etc), baby is taking swim classes. I want them to be busy and don\\'t be stuck at home. And obviously, we don\\'t speak Danish (yet). How does this side of things work?\\n\\n8. Work. I\\'m a software engineer (senior full-stack, react/angular/.net), never had issues with finding a job in Ireland. I\\'ll need to start at a new Danish job in September for the \"move\" to work. I also would love to qualify for the expat tax regime, but the salary requirement is way above average. Should I start looking for a job now? Or is it ok to relax and postpone it until May/June? I just have no idea how the job market is.\\n\\nHope it makes sense. Just started analysing all the things and I\\'m getting quite anxious. I always wanted to move to Denmark, and now I\\'ve got the best opportunity to do it, but I guess I\\'m getting older and a bit scared things could go sideways.', 'comments': [\"Hello! I don't necessarily have all of the answers but I relocated to Copenhagen recently from the UK as an Irish citizen so I can at least share my experiences. I was in your shoes this time last year and I understand how difficult it is to find concise info for some of your questions. \\n\\nPlease note that I already had a Danish partner, only had myself to register and a job contract in hand. Which made certain aspects of moving smoother for sure.\\n\\n1) Yes, you pretty much need the rental sorted first. You need to provide either a rental agreement or a signed form from the property owner to say you are residing there if you are sub-letting in order to get the EU residence doc. You can fill in the required forms online but you will need to physically go to a immigration office to complete the application. \\n\\nI got my EU residence document at the International House in Copenhagen, and was quite straightforward after some prep. The international house is run by the CPH Kommune but they have officers from SIRI that come to issue residence documents. You can book an appointment for an EU residence document on their website. Prior to going a long to the appointment, fill out the OD1 application form either online or hard copy. If everything is in order they may issue the EU residence doc. on the same day, which is what happened in my case. \\n\\n[You can find more info and book registration appointments at the International House in CPH here.](https://ihcph.kk.dk/registration-services)\\n\\n2) I don't think that you necessarily need the residence document to open a DK bank account but you will need a CPR number. And you cannot get your CPR number until you have the residence doc. I was able to get my CPR issued on the same day as my resident doc by filling out the form on the International House website. Once you have your CPR number you should be able to set up MitID (an authentication app tied to your CPR) which is required by Danish banks for online services. I would think that a Revolut account would be fine for you initially for general purchases and payments. Although, in my case, my employer could only pay my salary through my 'NemKonto', so I needed a Danish bank account quickly. For a quick Danish bank account, I would recommend Lunar. Basically the Danish equivalent of Revolut. \\n\\n3) Finding a rental is quite stressful, especially with pets (I have 2 cats). My Danish partner did most of the contacting and we ended up exclusively using [boligportal.dk](http://boligportal.dk) . It probably took us about 2-3 months but that was with contacting new listings every day. We ran into the problem that a lot of agents would only invite us to open-houses and then drop us when we said we couldn't make them (weren't in DK yet). We didn't have issues with scammers but most of the places we were looking at were being leased by legitimate (and searchable) rental companies. We had issues with the 2 cats, we were told it was unlikely that we'd find anything in certain areas in CPH that would allow pets, and that there being more than 1 pet was an additional issue. For dogs (at least in new-build city apartments) they typically had weight restrictions (e.g. under 10-15kg or something). So if you have a big dog you might struggle more. But if you are looking for a place further out, you might not have such issues. \\n\\n5. Don't have a car so you'll have to look it up yourself but I do believe there is a time limit and you will most likely have to pay a pretty hefty import tax on it. Cars are crazy expensive here. \\n\\n8. I am not in your field, I'm in medical research but as a point of reference: I applied for a job in January, interviewed in February, and my offered start date was either June or August. I selected August so I had more time to organise and work out the logistics of moving. Denmark work circles can be quite insular and difficult to break into so I really recommend securing a job prior to moving. You can move to Denmark as an EU citizen with the intention of finding work but you have a time limit of 6 months to find employment. After that you will be asked to leave, so better to have everything in place when you're moving a whole family.\"]}, {'title': '[2/3] The Ultimate DD guide to the moon!!.

By the end of this posts, **Kenny will be FULLY EXPOSED!**\\n\\n\\\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n**HOW AND WHY TO BANKRUPT COMPANIES**\\n\\nWhile a company is heading to bankruptcy (still not bankrupt), they keep shorting and shorting with those naked shares created to drop the price, once they used a share too many times (too many IOUs) they either pack them into trust bonds (for more liquidity for fuckery) and sell them or dump them into a bank ETF (that also tanks the price in the main exchange while also “hiding” the naked shares).\\n\\n**Seriously Kenny?**\\n\\n**Then they try so hard to bankrupt the company.** The company shares are now worthless so they don’t need to return any naked shares they produced (and I think they don’t even need to pay tax on the difference they make). They made a shit ton of money on betting against the company with options (puts) predicting the company is going down while manipulating the price the whole time.\\n\\nSo Kenny has been shorting this companies for a reason: yes, it makes him a shit ton of money.\\n\\nIs that his goal though? No.\\n\\n**His goal is to be the king of everything, to own it all. But how does shorting companies help him achieve that?** Additionally, if he truly is shorting treasury bonds it is because he expects a lack of solvency on the part of the Fed.\\n\\nso lets keep looking at how he does it. **Bloody King of fake shares (nothing) Kenny.** Yikes!\\n\\nWhen the company is worthless it is then the best time for Shitadel to buy the business shares super cheap **along with the real estate!

They misreported key financial information in [48% of loans](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/29/2/384/1903200) securitized by nongovernment agencies.\\n\\n**BOOM!**\\n\\n* Underwriters at investment banks, who earned more by securitizing low-quality loans with high interest rates and marketing them to investors as high-quality. In legal settlements with the Department of Justice, many admitted they knowingly put false figures into prospectuses.\\n\\n**BOOM!**\\n\\n* Credit rating agencies, which needed underwriters as clients. They often inflated ratings of mortgage-backed securities by adjusting their standard rating models. Without such adjustments, one study found, a top-quality AAA security would have fallen to a barely-investment-grade BBB.\\n\\n**BOOM!**\\n\\n* The biggest fraud potential, Griffin said, is no longer with home mortgages. It’s with other kinds of securitized assets, such as commercial mortgages. For collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), a kind of security backed by business loans, he’s found evidence that [the underlying loans are riskier than the CLOs’ ratings reflect](https://retirementincomejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SSRN-id3707557.pdf).\\n\\n**BIG BADA BOOM!!!**\\n\\nThis is telling us that there is a MASSIVE scam going on!\\n\\n[BOOM!](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/04/ken-griffin-goes-on-290-million-real-estate-spree.html)\\n\\n[BOOM!](https://www.newsbreak.com/illinois/chicago/news/0NNQ2yrU/ken-griffin-invests-in-real-estate-tech-firm)\\n\\n[BOOM!](https://www.ft.com/content/25e6100d-4cdd-45d0-aaab-6f9b77b14257)\\n\\nNo comments on the deals?

Using those third party realty investors!\\n\\nBasically give the **BAG** to the bank and leave them **HOLDING IT!!**\\n\\nGuess who has a SHIT TON OF REAL ESTATE???\\n\\nYou guessed right!!! GME AND AMC!!! Woooohoool\\n\\nhttps://outline.com/pTpkmm\\n\\nSO where is the bubble?\\n\\nLike professor Jhon Griffin said on that glorious article....

So what they could be doing is… follow me on this one**\\n\\nIs it possible that leased real estate from those companies they are trying to bankrupt can be collateralized for loans by a third party? \\n\\nYES!\\n\\nSo…..\\n\\nThey buy the property (not from game stop but form the current owners of the real estate) with a loan trough a third party realty investor that uses equity to get the loans (the property appraisal then is inflated so the loan is higher). \\n\\nThey get the loan for the appraised amount first and put the current GameStop lease as collateral. No liability for Citadel, is using a third party, equity from non existing money (the trust bonds money) and the current GameStop lease as collateral (GameStop is not planning to move or leave for a while!)\\n\\nWhith the bigger loan they buy the property cheaper (at the price really worth not the inflated appraisal price) and pocket the difference.\\n\\nOnce GameStop bankrupt then the they stop paying  the loan and let it defaults, the collateral is gone!.\\n\\nNow the bank has to sell the property (usually action), citadel uses the third party again and buys the property dirt cheap at auction with equity again (yup money from the trust bonds!) at lower prices.\\n\\nIt’s a delicious double wash! BOOM! 🤯 \\n\\n**BOOM!**\\n\\nThey don’t buy the real estate directly tho. They are using this CITY TERRACE LLCand others, this is how I connected citadel with them \\n\\nI started here\\n\\nhttps://opencorporates.com/companies?q=CITADEL+SECURITIES+LLC\\n\\nAfter following the Dallas TX address lead me here\\n\\nThen got here: \\nhttps://opencorporates.com/companies/us_de/5634119\\n\\n1999 BRYAN ST STE 900\\nDALLAS TX 75201\\xa0- 3140\\n\\nThat Address connects directly to this address \\n\\n3700 N.

The TXT records include domain verification for GlobalSign and Google, which are positive signs of an attempt to validate domain ownership and use services like Google Workspace. The SPF record is set to allow sending emails from a specific IP address, which is a good practice for preventing email spoofing. There is no immediate evidence of malicious activity based on the DNS records, but the presence of an SPF record indicates that the domain sends emails and has taken steps to secure its email sending reputation. Based on the observations made, there are no overt signs that \"o-baby.net\" is a scam website. The website is accessible, has been registered since 2000, uses a privacy protection service in WHOIS (which is not uncommon), has a valid SSL certificate, and the DNS records are consistent with those of a legitimate business. Additionally, the WHOIS information indicates a long-standing domain registration, which is often associated with legitimate websites. Without concrete evidence of scam characteristics and in the absence of negative reports on social media or forums, I cannot conclusively determine that \"o-baby.net\" is a scam website. It is worth noting that the absence of scam reports does not guarantee that a site is legitimate, and users should always exercise caution, especially when providing personal information or making purchases.
