It is, perhaps, a greater logistical undertaking than the Vietnam War. That post is my personal Vietnam. My magnum opus. My life’s work. It will be here someday. But, while I work on research for that, it’s led me to some weird places. \\n\\nLet me put it like this. In the 1950s, America and Russia were fighting to be the first people in space and on the moon. Both countries were grinding HARD. They had their best scientists working round the clock to figure out how to do it. And while they were building spaceships and telescopes and whatever else you needed for a moon landing, they actually invented a whole lot of other useful stuff in the process. Sometimes it was by accident, and sometimes it was on purpose to solve a problem. At one point, NASA invented this inner ear device to measure ear pressure. I guess if you go up into space too fast your brain can explode or something? I don’t know all the details, I’m not a scientist. But they made the inner ear device because they were working on making a spaceship to land on the moon. Writing the Tana Mongeau Scamming Masterpost is me building a spaceship to land on the moon. This post is my inner ear measuring device I accidentally invented along the way. \\n\\nMy most recent inner ear measuring device was this [passionate defense](https://www.reddit.com/r/canceledpod/comments/164tr8b/was_tanas_perfume_release_tana_by_tana_a_scam_an/) of Tana’s short-lived perfume line, Tana By Tana. But by far the most frustrating place this deep dive has lead me is the fucking goddamn Pandemic of Love. Even typing the words as I write this intro is making me tense. \\n\\nWithout further ado, let’s dive in.\\n\\n**Part 1: The Calm Before the Storm** \\n\\nI’ve said before that the 2020 era of Tana is my favorite because of how simultaneously messy and organized it was. I always think of 2020 Tana as [this very insensitive but also very funny ](https://twitter.com/verythickvajjjj/status/1352495254415486977)tweet about Christina Aguilera. For sure, Tana’s “fat, broke and nasty” moment was the fallout from the SimplyNessa racism accusations, Jake Paul “divorce” ugh and ew, and a mess of other circumstances. Basically, she had one shot, one opportunity. And, um…things happened. \\n\\nSome time in 2020, Tana launched an Instagram account called theeleventelevenproject. It was and is mostly inspirational “take care of your mental health bb” pastel posts made in canva or ripped from Pinterest. Whatever. Not really saving lives, but certainly not hurting anyone. But where things get interesting is the website and the “charity” around it. The website…doesn’t exist anymore, but thankfully this handy dandy [Life and Style article](https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/tana-mongeau-starts-charity-helping-families-affected-by-coronavirus/) can give us a taste of what it was like. “11:11 is a movement started to make an immediate impact against the \\\\[coronavirus…With millions of Americans out of work we want to come together to help support the people who need it the most. The people who have lost their jobs; the people who can’t pay medical bills; the parents who can’t provide lunch for their kids…11:11 is an opportunity for us to come together like never before and find those people who need help the most.”\\n\\nUm, okay. That’s really a nice sentiment. But Tana was famously [extremely careless](https://www.insider.com/celebrity-influencer-party-partying-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-2021-3) about COVID, and [was slammed pretty hard ](https://people.com/tv/tana-mongeau-apologies-for-attending-party-during-pandemic/)about partying when LA had huge surges and all hospital beds were full. At one point, she seemed to have a change of heart, and even [apologized for her actions](https://www.vulture.com/2020/07/james-charles-tana-mongeau-apologize-hype-house-party.html). Only, I guess she must have changed her mind, because she went out again, just one week after [posting that public apology](https://www.intheknow.com/post/tana-mongeau-slammed-for-partying-just-one-week-after-apologizing-for-her-behavior/). So…make of that what you will. \\n\\n**Part 2: The Beginning of my Unraveling**\\n\\nAccording to Tana herself on Twitter, they made over $100,000 [selling hoodies](https://twitter.com/tanamongeau/status/1245573572115873792) with the proceeds going to the 11:11 Project, and this new charity, called Pandemic of Love that Tana was partnering with. \\n\\nOh, yes. Pandemic of Love. After doing this deep dive, I now need a new trigger warning. Trigger warning, Pandemic of Love. Because this stupid organization has me literally spiraling. Besties,I have looked at the words “Pandemic of Love” so much in the last few days. It feels like they are burned into my eyelids. What does the name of this group even mean? \\n\\n“Pandemic” is a word we associate with bad things. Virus. Sickness. Infection. Are you…infecting the world with love? Or, are you trying to exterminate and cure love, and end the pandemic? None of these words even have meaning. What were they possibly thinking when they named this group? I wish I would have stopped there. \\n\\n**Part 3:  A Necessary Lesson in Tax Law (TW evil combination of both math and Pandemic of Love)** \\n\\nOkay. In order to learn some more about the tea, we have to first learn some tax law. No, wait! Please don’t click away. I promise I’ll make it as easy and simple as possible.\\n\\nBasically, the American government lets nonprofits file their taxes as something called a \\n\\n501(c)(3). This makes them tax-exempt, and gives them other benefits. Only charities are allowed to file for this, and it's a way that the government cuts a break for people trying to do good in the world. The range of what can be considered a 501(c)(3) is pretty big. Your college probably is one. So are most churches, synagogues and mosques. \\n\\n501(c)(3) tax filings are public. You can look it up and see what percentage of donations they use to pay staff, their rent, expenses and how much actually goes to the people they’re helping. They’re allowed to crop out the names and addresses of donors, but you can see how much  It’s a nosy person’s dream and it's a good way to see what charities are actually using the funds for. [Here](https://www.charitynavigator.org/) is a pretty reliable website that talks about this further, and shows some of these reports online. I’ll use another online creator as an example. Streamer [Maya Higa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Higa) created [Alveus](https://www.alveussanctuary.org/about/alveus), an animal sanctuary in 2021. Because Alveus is a 501(c)(3), we can see their tax filings. [Here](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/861772907) we can see that Maya paid herself $0 as the founder and executive director of Alveus. And this is really neat and also very useful information. \\n\\nSo, basically, the American government gives a lot of tax breaks to charities and other organizations that help communities. “Well, isn’t that nice, Dingo. But what the hell does tax law have to do with online social media starlet Tana Mongeau?” you ask. Well, I’ll tell you. Which leads me to the meat and potatoes of this discussion, and why the hell we have spent so much time talking about tax law on an influencer subreddit. \\n\\nPandemic of Love isn’t a 501(c)3. In fact, they aren’t anything at all. \\n\\n**Part 3: Empty Dingo and the Search for the Hidden Tax Filings (TW even more Pandemic of Love)**\\n\\nI’ll say this in the nicest way possible. Pandemic of Love’s tax filings make my brain want to explode. \\n\\nThey made my brain want to explode because they simply do not exist. I can’t fathom why they aren’t a 501c3. The goddamn NRA is a 501c3. Their [partner organizations ](https://www.pandemicoflove.com/index.php/partner-communities/)are [501(c)(3)s](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/464883189). It drove me up a fucking wall. It is still driving me up a fucking wall. If anyone here knows tax law better and can tell me, please do. It’s literally giving me an aneurysm. \\n\\nNow, from what I can tell online, Pandemic of Love seems to be helping some people. It has some [positive press coverage](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/24/us/iyw-pandemic-of-love-organization-trnd/index.html). And I can’t knock them for that! It might be genuinely helping people. But oh my sweet baby Jesus, where the fuckity fuck are their tax filings? It blows my mind. I can’t understand it. The website prompts you to donate with a google form. A google. Fucking. Form. Like this is a survey I created for my high school sociology class. And this is an official charity organization that was featured on CNN? I’m getting dizzy. Hold on, I might pass out. \\n\\nThis [podcast episode ](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Pandemic-of-Love-with-Shelly-Tygielski-Podcast/B09WMW1BVQ)even calls it a nonprofit! And that is in a recorded interview with its founder! And yet, Pandemic of Love simply is not a nonprofit. Not according to any US tax codes since it started. And maybe this charity helps people and is totally legitimate, but that lack of transparency and having no explanation for it, is fucking weird to me. \\n\\n**Final Thoughts (TW final mentions of fucking Pandemic of Love)** \\n\\n**Is Pandemic of Love a fake charity?** \\n\\nThere are some things about it that are extremely weird to me, but calling an entire organization fake is a really big accusation, and definitely one that I don’t think we have enough evidence to make. Does it have a stupid name? Yes, and I am not afraid to say that. But a [website called](https://dailysoapdish.com/2021/02/tana-mongeau-involved-in-another-scam/) “the daily soap dish” is just not a reliable enough source for me, y’all. But, some things about it are just sketchy. So, let me put it like this: if my friend told me they had $1,000 they were planning to donate to charity, I would urge them to select a different one where there is a public record about what the money is used for. You all can do what you wish. Also, I think this should go without saying, but Tana obviously can’t control how this organization chooses to file their taxes, and I don’t blame her for it. \\n\\n**Did Tana pocket the money herself?**\\n\\nI certainly hope not. Accusing someone of stealing from a charity is a really big deal, and there’s almost no proof that happened. Tana has also done some really admirable charity work in the past. She [did a collaboration](https://www.exclusivehollywood.co.uk/tana-mongeau-msyfao-trevor-project) with the Trevor Project in 2020 (which actually is a 501(c)(3) mind you.)She also has [worked with the Polaris Project ](https://he-il.facebook.com/TanaMongeauYT1/videos/tana4polaris/302516467014242/)in the past, another 501(c)(3) who works to fight against sex trafficking. \\n\\n**What happened to the 11:11 Project?**\\n\\nBeats me. They haven’t posted on Instagram since the 2020 election when they encouraged people to vote. This was also around the time Tana split from her long term manager Jordan Worona. Maybe he was caught up with it, or she just lost interest. \\n\\nThis was originally supposed to be part of my mega-masterpost of every time Tana has ever been accused of a scam, but I got too obsessed with the tax filings of this stupid group. I don’t know what the crossover is between tax law girls and Tana Mongeau fans, but I knew I had to do it for the culture. And also to save myself, because I was being driven crazy by trying to track down these tax returns. \", 'comments': ['everything tana launches is sketchy lol but i love ur deepdives lmfao', 'Have you ever thought of making these into videos?

Seeing all of you share your unique perspectives and stand your ground – you don’t even know how inspiring your confidence is. You may not even see it in yourselves, because a lot of us are confused and slightly heartbroken at this time.\\n\\nSo I am telling you right now – you are Divinely Destined to be here because at least one person (me) needed you.\\n\\nOne of my favorite writers in this thread, u/Kind_Net_2042, suggested that I share my own Mina story in a post.\\n\\nNow, if I were to take Mina’s approach, I would spend the next 30 minutes telling you how I resisted this idea at first but then realized I was meant to do it. Or, better yet, Divinely Destined.\\n\\nHonestly, that really *was* part of my process, and one of the things I once found relatable about Mina. She knew how to hook us kind-hearted, spiritual, religious women with her “God made me do it” talk. How many of us squeal at coincidences, rejoice at desired opportunities showing up and feel super Divinely Destined for stuff? (I hope I'm not the only one lol).\\n\\nWell, I did not feel all that destined to take Mina’s courses. We are going to talk about how **her marketing made me do it.**\\n\\nAs mentioned [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/scammedByMinaIrfan/comments/1b7b7mt/comment/kznuy0y/?context=3), Mina uses FOMO, a manufactured sense of scarcity, and other deceptive tactics to sell her courses. She also manages to convince you that her courses are absolutely life-changing. Which is what people in vulnerable states want, right? We want to change our lives for the better.\\n\\nIt doesn’t matter if we give her 30k for the University Bundle, or 20 bucks for the YouTube Membership. What we are ultimately paying for is the change that she promises.\\n\\nMina tells you it’s important to get in a high-vibe state when buying her products. Because then the effect will be better. \\n\\nI agree, that you should only spend money in a high vibe state. And you do that by **only making purchases that you will not regret later.**\\n\\nI am really curious if you have bought her stuff, how did you feel? Did you feel expanded hitting that “pay” button, or did you instantly shrink and feel unstable?\\n\\nIt’s the latter for me.\\n\\nI got her Basic Babe Bundle on sale for $444 and I DID NOT feel high-vibe.\\n\\nThis may not sound like a lot of money, compared to the tens of thousands that some people have spent on her programs, but it was a very significant portion of my money. I would say it was about 1/5 of all my savings at the time.\\n\\nWhich tells you how unstable my situation already was.\\n\\nI am a **war refugee** in a foreign country, and my main source of income is my student loan. With so much instability already in my life, I wanted to make a change for the better. To hell with frugality.\\n\\nI could see myself letting go of my limiting beliefs and triggers, and building my dream life here in a new country. If only I could have her program. I felt like it was “now or never” with the basic babe sale. I couldn’t let my dream life slip away when I had at least some money in my bank account.\\n\\nNow, what’s also interesting, is that Mina has recently mentioned war refugees as part of **her audience demographic**. This was in her livestream where she talks about frequency holders. (I have no desire to rewatch any of her content, so I am unable to provide a link. But if anyone has it, feel free to put it in a comment.)\\n\\nBasically, she says that she is not getting herself involved with any low-vibe agendas because her job is to be the safe space for good vibes. She gets to live an easy life of scamming women while others try to save whales etc.\\n\\nShe proceeds to say that some people who watch her content actually are victims of war, and they appreciate having this space free of discussions of war and fake sympathy.\\n\\nWhich I honestly agreed with.\\n\\nI really liked **living in delulu land with Mina** and thinking that anything I “invest” with her will manifest eleven fold as my dream life.\\n\\nWhich makes me think: **how many other** war refugees and people feeling very lost saw Mina as the solution? Probably a lot!\\n\\nProbably most of her clients felt that way.\\n\\nBut I did not want to feel low-vibe or heavy while making this purchase. I never want to regret spending money. And something in me was telling me that I probably would with the Basic Babe Bundle. I did not feel like a basic babe, after all.\\n\\nBut because Mina kept saying that even her higher-stage students often went back and bought the bundle because it was an “essential foundation”, I sighed and decided to buy it. And yes, the only reason I bought it when I did was because it was on sale.\\n\\nTo feel high-vibe, I sat there on my bed, took deep breaths, and tried to brainwash myself into believing that this was something that my heart was calling out to. I tried to pretend that it made me feel Divinely Destined and elevated. I wanted to get done with my victim mentality and move into the self-aware Barbie land. And any resistance I felt within me I attributed to how hard it was to let go of my old identity.\\n\\nLong story short, this heavy feeling remained with me as I started going through the bundle, especially when I discovered that it wasn’t as life-changing as I expected. I could not relate to the “baby steps” narrative that was almost putting me back a few levels when I “quantum jumped” so much to be able to afford this course.\\n\\nNow, I don’t want to do a 180 and start declaring that nothing Mina ever said was helpful. I did listen to her for a reason and found much of her advice uplifting. But I could not in all honesty say that I received good value for money in this course.\\n\\nTo me, the Basic Babe Bundle seems like a starter for her to suck you into the ecosystem of her courses, and convince you that you know less than you actually do, while she has all the answers for you.\\n\\nAs discussed [in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/scammedByMinaIrfan/comments/1c4v3xs/comment/kzq6hh6/), it is important to **allow yourself to be the authority in your life** and not seek guidance from other flawed and human people who are not God and not your ultimate, Divinely Destined truth.\\n\\nWith love,\\n\\nBabyGirlMakesArt xoxo\", 'comments': ['Beautifully written! These are the type of personal stories we really appreciate! \\n\\nI know it can be intimidating to hear people say how they lost $10k, 30k, $50k and above. You are tempted to think, well I \"only\" lost $444.\\n\\nBut $444 is a LOT OF MONEY! Even for people in the U.S.! I\\'m at the point now that even if you scammed me out $20, you sill can get this work. The only reason I was able to climb out of debt was because I became super frugal and learned to appreciate and value every dollar. Heck, I even made a fuss the other day when my change was short by 10 cents. \\n\\nIt is so unfortunate the way Mina does mind games and makes us think that what she\\'s charging is no big deal. (But try to get a refund and all of a sudden it\\'s a big deal)\\n\\nAnd then how much more for someone who doesn\\'t even make USD? She will brag about how people from third world countries \"manifest\" the money for her courses. It just makes my heart sink honestly. Who knows what some of those people had to do to \"manifest\" the money. All because they really fell for her hype. And you are right, some of those people will be the most desperate for her work!\\n\\nThank you so much for sharing your perspective. People need to know the harm that Mina is doing to women around the world.', 'Thank you for sharing your insight. This was very beautifully written and articulated. I really LOVE seeing how BRILLIANT and wise all of you women are. Yes even the Basic Babes 😂…too soon? \\n\\nThe more I see how intelligent and lovely this group of women are, I learn and realize that even the most intelligent and lovely women desire love, fulfillment and happiness. In which, we are worthy of. And it seems as though, we’re collectively expanding in the way that we’re realizing love, fulfillment and happiness is already within us. Right here and now. Never externally, never in the validation or determined fate of another human being. Not after “leveling up” from being a “basic babe” to a “high end Divinity.” We’re enough NOW. In God’s image, we are all Divine. \\n\\nAlso thank you for providing which bundle you purchased, at the price you purchased, and what value you received and/or didn’t receive. I’m taking taking note. 🤓 \\nI hope to curate testimonials if a lawsuit does pursue, always with the intention to prevent this from happening to other women. And if it does come to that, I will ask your permission to use your information before proceeding.', 'When I came across Mina\\'s videos I was living with my fiance (in a 5 years engagement). I was in that stage of trying to make everything in my life work, a typical of what she would call: a Self Aware [Barbie.My](http://Barbie.My) life seemed good as I has a good job, was fit and took care of my appearance, I had and always have had a supportive family.But what was making me feel like drowning were problems that I had with my IN LAWS. I would fight pretty much every day with my fiance for something related to them. I was so hurt that he couldn\\'t be on my side. But what hurt me even more was that he was FINANCIALLY HELPING THEM, while we would pay out household expenses 50/50. And sometimes he would ask me for a debt and sometimes he would tell me \"next month\" when I wanted to buy something for our home like for example a washing machine.I even agreed to help his family, but only up to a certain amount every month, but no, he couldn\\'t agree with this as he would help them spontaneously, the more they complained (and emotionally manipulated him), the more he would help them. This went against my core values for balance and core needs for clarity.I knew that some women were being provided for, and I was jealous. Some women married men who had a house while we bought ours 50/50. I thought that I had to learn to be successful in both: 1. my career (and making money myself) and 2. being provided for.So, I started following some \" gold digger\" youtube channels and Facebook groups. I would follow their discussions and one part of me was disgusted. And there was a big gab in my mind between those women and me.In one of those Facebook groups someone had shared one of the Mina\\'s videos. From what I remember, it was a video titled \"Let go of 50/50 relationships and date older men\".I immediately liked me as she seemed like me. She had tried being in a serious relationship before in which she acted like a real partner and shared what she had with a man who deceived her and used her for money.I followed her youtube content for 2 years before I bought a course. What I liked about her was not only her content about men providing, but also her videos about organization, how she liked to make everything easy, which totally resonated with me (meal prepping, exercising just 20 min a day, a capsule wardrobe).The first course that I bought was the DIVINE UNION. When I bought it, it felt like an all or nothing moment because of it\\'s super high cost. But, what did I need the money in my bank account for if I was not happy? And, I would rather throw money in the bin, rather than help my in laws. And the more money I had, the more my fiance would help his family.Still today, I haven\\'t completed the Divine Union. But I\\'ve completed every course that I bought after that.', \"I always felt like maybe it's not a lot of money for people living in the US but this gave me a lot of perspective. Thank you for saying it is a lot of money! With all the repetition of it's not that much, it will be your coffee money one day dadada, it made me think okay money is arbitrary. Nope nope nope nope. It's not grounded in reality as people are clearly suffering from the consequences of spending for courses to acheive their dream and it certainly hasn't multiplied. And then sunk-cost fallacy starts to sink in. I'm noticing a lot of double standards or contradictions lately too.\", 'Awesome post!!!👏👏👏']}, {'title': 'The El Paso shooter’s manifesto described his attack as a response to a \"Hispanic invasion\" – here is 50 instances where /r/the_donald called immigrants an “invasion” in the 2 weeks prior to the attack', 'subreddit': 'AgainstHateSubreddits', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/cn6dti/the_el_paso_shooters_manifesto_described_his/', 'selftext': '>i\\'m so sick of this asylum bullshit.
