We love the show so much that we have considered getting tattoos based on it, and we reference it all the time. Two particular characters in the show are best friends, and they used to play soccer together.

All warrior shrines and seer schools were represented by at least a few members. Many other Paths were represented, either due to invitation to contribute to the discussion or because of curiosity, and as divided among different conclaves, fraternities and other factions as the warriors and seers.\\n\\nFrom the desk he and his staff were sitting, Baralei thought about the changes that happened since the last councils. Traditionally, Romnhemeze had fielded more aspect warriors focused in ranged combat, but the shrines of the Howling Banshees experienced a surge in popularity since the Great Rift opened. The number of curious watchers was growing too. Bonesingers had redesigned the Hall of the Distant Storms' galleries to hold more of them for this meeting.\\n\\nThe mutter of conversation faded as members of the Seer Council - who in Romnhemeze were usually the heads of the seer schools - walked to the main tables.\\n\\n“Greetings to all that have come to this most important meeting.” The one chosen to mediate the proceedings was Calianze, Master Seer from the Sunlight Hill School. “Let us begin with the most important matters: those about the so-called Organ Rippers Chaos fleet under Red Admiral Trond. The ships we sent are drawing them towards Quesian domains in the Emerald Shore. Information we provided to the Biocracy through trade simulations put the Quesians on alert, so the fleet's advance will be slowed and probably stopped altogether. I pass the word to admiral Aumiedi, who shall present the current situation in the Biocracy.”\\n\\nThe admiral stood up.\\n\\n“Thank you, Master Calianze. The forces committed to the fighting so far are restricted to a handful of light cruisers to draw the Chaos fleet in the direction we want, but we have a few other ships disguised as trading ships docked in key Quesian systems. Should fate try to escape our hands, admiral Talani will take command of all assets available in the Emerald Reach's zone, which will buy us time to send reinforcements.”\\n\\n“If I remember correctly, we sent some warlocks with him.” Khalianze said. “Did they detect signs of cult activity inside the Biocracy?”\\n\\n“Nothing the Quesians haven't found out already.”\\n\\nThe farseer nodded and turned to the crowd. “Does anyone want to make use of the word?”\\n\\nA farseer from the School of the Rising Sea asked for the word.\\n\\n“I and several of my colleagues saw that the Lord of Skulls’ berserkers may join the attack against the Quesians, increasing the futures where the Chaos fleet intercepts our craftworld. We would like to put it under the scritunity of other schools”\\n\\nAt Baralei’s side, Misanga stiffened. Her mind touched his, allowing him to orbitate the gestalt that the seers formed as the different schools analyze the visions of the Rising Sea. He could feel other admirals and autarchs also spinning around, those working with the Emerald Shore’s theater relaying their opinions to the seers.\\n\\nThe seers’ counsciences separated like a *saitosigii* puzzle, and soon after Misanga gently pushed him back to his body.\\n\\n“After deliberation, we concluded the fate of most warbands of the emperor's corrupted spawn don’t intersect with ours.” Calianze declared. “If chaos marines join the Organ Rippers, it will be in numbers the aspect warriors already under admiral Aumeidi and autarch Talani's command will suffice. Does anyone else want to make use of the word?”\\n\\nMore people wanted to. Some asked what safety measures should be prepared should the worst come to pass and the Organ Rippers managed to reach Romnhemeze. About how fast the Path of the Shipwright could repair and build ships. Scholars discussed how the manipulation of the Quesians should be done from now on. Nobody would admit it, but the mistake of a spiritseer that led to a discussion between wraiths wandering into senile chit-chat was humorous. Hours had passed by the time the session was suspended for a meal.\\n\\nThen came the second part of the council, and this time Baralei would speak.\\n\\n*Too many people stayed*, he noted, comparing it to the much smaller audience that watched the council before the raid in the mon’keigh world of Tassjland.\\n\\n“While the Organ Rippers are a greater danger, for they might one day reach our craftworld”, said Calianze, “there is another problem we need to address. The mon’keigh are still gearing for invasion over the Emerald Shore and may put all our work there in risk”. A collective lament came from the crowd and many questions started to fly towards the board members. The Seer Council pounded their staves to the ground until the crowd silenced. “We know some of you hoped they would lose all courage. We too hoped for it, but they didn’t, so we will follow the plan for this eventuality: to draw them out and fight in a chosen location. I pass the word to Autarch Baralei, who led the previous operation against the mon’keigh.”\\n\\nBaralei stepped into the dais. He needed a moment to remember his notes.\\n\\n“As soon as the Seer Council told me that further operations against the mon’keigh would be necessary, I started to prepare with the help of Seer Misanga of the Grey Sleeping Fields School and Admiral Auraxi. After consulting several scholars, seers, star charts and Webway maps, we chose to make a stand in the Dreva system. The mon’keigh will exit the warp there to plot their course before venturing forward rather than risk sailing into the warp storms closer to the Great Rift. In many futures, they will also set up a base there before venturing further.”\\n\\nHe paused for a moment before continuing. “We will let the mon’keigh enter the system unimpeded and only reveal our presence when they approach a stronghold we will build on one of the moons in the system, from where we will be firing ant-orbital weapons. They will have to choose between fighting us, return to their space or advance towards the Quesian space with no supply routes or a proper route.”\\n\\n“Why will we give the mon’keigh battle on the ground instead of deploying a fleet against them?” asked a Dark Reaper from the Dark Waves Shrine.\\n\\n“The Dreva system has plenty of stellar dust fields and other phenomena that limitate our fleets’ cloaking abilities. In the evaluation of Admiral Auraxi, it is better to surprise the mon’keigh with hidden anti-orbital batteries than risking ships we may come to need.” Baralei paused again. The next part was going to be a long one. “To prepare our base, I will require Wilderers from the Academy of Green Canyon to terraform the land. Bonesingers from the Chorus of Minas-Lin to build the base proper and the Crafters of the Awyr Goch Guild to assit them in furnishing it. Healers of the School of Spring’s Winds shall contribute with their specialities. Finally, I will request the anti-orbital weapons from the Tywyllsffer Hold and their associated crafters for operators and maintenance.\\n\\nThe crowd exploded into talking. Representatives of the groups he named celebrated for being called into action, complained for the same reason, were cheered by their allies and cursed by their rivals. Unless the situation was dire, such manifestations were allowed. Every Romnhemezi was free to think for themselves.\\n\\n“Meanwhile, to keep damaging the mon’keigh war effort, I will send two *cwmni* of Reapers of the Shrine of Dusk Walkers and fifty Dragons of the Dying Embers to destroy Mechanicus tank forges in Saint Ursillia’s World. To attack the voidyard of Kelevarn, I will send another hundred warriors, from the Snowy Hills Swooping Hawks.

The Seer Council pounded their staves to the ground until the crowd silenced. “We know some of you hoped they would lose all courage. We too hoped for it, but they didn’t, so we will follow the plan for this eventuality: to draw them out and fight in a chosen location. I pass the word to Autarch Baralei, who led the previous operation against the mon’keigh.”\\n\\nBaralei stepped into the dais. He needed a moment to remember his notes.\\n\\n“As soon as the Seer Council told me that further operations against the mon’keigh would be necessary, I started to prepare with the help of Seer Misanga of the Grey Sleeping Fields School and Admiral Auraxi. After consulting several scholars, seers, star charts and Webway maps, we chose to make a stand in the Dreva system. The mon’keigh will exit the warp there to plot their course before venturing forward rather than risk sailing into the warp storms closer to the Great Rift. In many futures, they will also set up a base there before venturing further.”\\n\\nHe paused for a moment before continuing. “We will let the mon’keigh enter the system unimpeded and only reveal our presence when they approach a stronghold we will build on one of the moons in the system, from where we will be firing ant-orbital weapons. They will have to choose between fighting us, return to their space or advance towards the Quesian space with no supply routes or a proper route.”\\n\\n“Why will we give the mon’keigh battle on the ground instead of deploying a fleet against them?” asked a Dark Reaper from the Dark Waves Shrine.\\n\\n“The Dreva system has plenty of stellar dust fields and other phenomena that limitate our fleets’ cloaking abilities. In the evaluation of Admiral Auraxi, it is better to surprise the mon’keigh with hidden anti-orbital batteries than risking ships we may come to need.” Baralei paused again. The next part was going to be a long one. “To prepare our base, I will require Wilderers from the Academy of Green Canyon to terraform the land. Bonesingers from the Chorus of Minas-Lin to build the base proper and the Crafters of the Awyr Goch Guild to assit them in furnishing it. Healers of the School of Spring’s Winds shall contribute with their specialities. Finally, I will request the anti-orbital weapons from the Tywyllsffer Hold and their associated crafters for operators and maintenance.\\n\\nThe crowd exploded into talking. Representatives of the groups he named celebrated for being called into action, complained for the same reason, were cheered by their allies and cursed by their rivals. Unless the situation was dire, such manifestations were allowed. Every Romnhemezi was free to think for themselves.\\n\\n“Meanwhile, to keep damaging the mon’keigh war effort, I will send two *cwmni* of Reapers of the Shrine of Dusk Walkers and fifty Dragons of the Dying Embers to destroy Mechanicus tank forges in Saint Ursillia’s World. To attack the voidyard of Kelevarn, I will send another hundred warriors, from the Snowy Hills Swooping Hawks. To the hives of Diomecletian, five hundreds of banshees...”\", 'comments': ['Pinned to read this later, I wanna read some good eldar stuff', 'I clicked on your profile and found this.

I\\'ve linked to the character\\'s respective trailers (except Springtron who does not have one, so I just included a picture) so you can see them and their abilities, stages/themes, and standard ARMS in action.\\n\\nQuick explanation, in ARMS you can charge up your ARMS to grant special attributes and do more damage depending on the attribute. Fire knocks down, Electric disables ARMS, Wind blows fighters away, Stun stuns movement for a moment, Explosion adds an additional explosion hit to punches, Ice slows down movement, Blind obscures vision, and Poison drains health. A few ARMS have the Null attribute which add unique, non-elemental effects.

The spirit switches between three states and Misango can fuse with them by guarding or charging long enough. Red grants Misango heavyweight punch and damage resistance and increases his size and throw damage, but reduces his mobility. Blue increases his mobility, but reduces his ARM size and throw damage. Yellow fills his super meter at a faster rate and grants a shield that blocks punches while activating his super, but decreases his mobility and throw damage.

He shares Spring Man\\'s shockwaves, but lacks his permanent charge below 25% HP and is slightly slower.

Though I think a realistic option is that Spring Man becomes playable and Springtron replaces the Spring Man Assist Trophy.', 'comments': [\"Reading this post makes me upset that there isn't a proper story mode in ARMS\\n\\ngod all of these characters are so unique and lovable\", \"I was actually partway through writing up a Max Brass theorycraft when the announcement came, but now that we've actually got an ARMS fighter coming I'll just scrap that and hope that he actually gets in instead.\\n\\nOne thing I'm definitely excited for is the music, ARMS has a damn good soundtrack. I definitely recommend checking it out. ARMS was actually worked on by largely the same team who worked on Mario Kart 8, which also has tons of amazing songs.\", \"Guess I'll be the one dude hoping for Master Mummy. I want more heavies dammit.\", '>Ribbon Girl\\n\\n>17\\n\\nOh nooooooo', 'So...this is all probably all an ad for Arms 2 right?']}]"
