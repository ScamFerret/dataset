Even for fans who did go through the manga/anime and OVAs first, it still structurally winds up feeling like one is putting the horse behind the cart, as they may want to see how this new interpretation builds up to that story.>!Also, given how TB concludes with the original's first scene, it may seem a little clunky watching the exact same sequence twice in succession.!<\"]}, {'title': 'Buying Japanese musical cast recordings, DVDs etc from outside of Japan?', 'subreddit': 'Broadway', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/zre0ne/buying_japanese_musical_cast_recordings_dvds_etc/', 'selftext': 'Just wondering if anyone here knew of any good websites that offer \"reasonably\"-priced international purchasing and shipping for Japanese musical theatre DVDs and cast recording CDs?\\n\\nI\\'ve occasionally been interested in buying these recordings, but from having a look online, it seems that the main and most legitimate-looking online Japanese retailers only ship within Japan.

I\\'m still studying chinese - and the tips about immersing were really helpful earlier when I was 5 months in, and now that immersing is much easier.\\n\\nI studied Japanese years ago - for one semester in college where we used Genki I. Then I studied on my own, for a total of about 2.5 years then I gave up. For 2 years I hardly made progress. Then at year 2, I found Nukemarine\\'s memrise courses and started them - my first time using any SRS flashcard type tool to study. Also my first time applying SRS to learning common words and grammar. Before that, with French, I\\'d used common word lists and just read a lot. But with Japanese for 2 years I hardly tried to read any manga, and only watched maybe a handful of youtube videos without subtitles in english. I was very afraid japanese would just \\'be too hard\\' and feel draining to try and comprehend. Even though I\\'d studied it for 2 years! I knew I could barely figure out even the main idea of a title of a japanese video on youtube, or a photo caption. I knew when I tried to pick up manga I couldn\\'t even follow a speech bubble. \\n\\nWell, after I started Nukemarine\\'s memrise courses, I felt like I was finally \\'learning things I could use.\\' Fun fact, Genki books 1 and 2 cover 1,700 words and 317 kanji (https://genki.japantimes.co.jp/faq_en#Q8). So simply me doing some SRS \\'deck\\' with common words, I was starting to cover more kanji in a month (Nukemarine\\'s deck starts with 500 kanji from Heisig RTK, then Tae Kim Grammar Points, then 1000 common words from the Core 2k). Since I had only read the first Genki 1 book, I was covering in months more material than I had in 2 years in japanese. (Which I guess my advice is, if you have Genki, either supplement with more vocab/kanji if you want to learn them faster or complete the books faster than the general 1/2 of a book a semester, which is what my college did). So, after I learned a decent basis (which looking back was actually pathetic as I had only studied 500 kanji, 300 common words, and 1/2 of the first course of the Tae Kim cards). I started trying to immerse for the first time in japanese! \\n\\nAnd what I learned back then, is that I should have been trying much sooner. In french I think what genuinely helped me so much, was I had tried to read from like 3 months onward on a weekly basis at least. But with japanese I\\'d just avoided trying to do any immersion because I\\'d thought it was \\'too hard.\\' Well year 2 I finally started - by reading manga and looking words up. It was still brutal, I could barely follow the gist. But I could START to follow the main idea after a few months! Who knew how much of that improvement was due to simply practicing doing it more. With some actual understanding of simple manga chapters overall main ideas (School Rumble, Ranma 1/2), I decided to try playing Kingdom Hearts 2 in japanese. Because its one of my favorite games, I knew the plot very well, and it was one of the games I wanted to experience in original form before localization. \\n\\nSo I tried. And it went? Actually bearable! I only remember playing maybe 4 hours. But I learned a lot of words, could actually follow way more than I expected to be able to (game menus in katana with the same english word meaning, being familiar with the game context meaning a decent amount of words I could guess). I only did it a little, then gave up. Because I was doing a lot of other big things in my life, and knew to improve in japanese would take dedicated time - it had not improved in most of those 2.5 years since most of that time I\\'d had to split dedication to it with school, with french (and russian for a short time when I needed some to communicate with people), and eventually 2 jobs. So I quit. What I learned from the experience had been: I should have immersed sooner, I was afraid of something because I just hadn\\'t tried it enough, and just like french simply USING the language more helped a lot. \\n\\n---\\n\\nSince then I took a break, graduate, a couple years later started learning chinese. Its been going well, and from the experience with french and japanese I started trying to read it by month 3 at least every few weeks, started trying to watch it by month 5 every few weeks, and by month 7 tried to listen to it on its own every few weeks. I found the mass immersion approach, and ended up realizing it had a lot in common with how I studied - so I looked into it and applied it more to my study plan. It made me decide to try upping chinese immersion to daily (first shows, now I read every day in chinese, and its what gave me the nerve to even attempt an audiobook and the radio). By the time I was following the immersion advice of Refold, I was already maybe 5 months+ into studying chinese. I had already learned 500 hanzi, it gave me the idea to use flashcards to study words so I studied 2000 common words with SRS, it gave me the idea to use sentences so I studied 500 sentences in Chinese Spoonfed (and found Chinese Spoonfed Audio files - which I use all the time as listening). But I was still too scared to immerse nearly as much as Refold suggests for something \\'hard\\' like Chinese until maybe 7 months in, 2000 words learned etc. And it was hard at first! But I did it more, got used to it, and it definitely is a huge reason my chinese has improved so much 1.5 years, compared to how my japanese was. I could never read novel chapters in japanese, or watch shows totally in chinese and relax/feel not drained/catch a majority of what\\'s going on. I could never listen to AUDIO ONLY of japanese like an audiodrama or a show without subtitles.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIMMERSING AT THE BEGINNING:\\n\\nI just restarted learning Japanese again. I got into something japanese again, and it reminded me how much I used to want to learn the language. And my chinese is finally solid enough I feel I won\\'t lose it - unlike japanese, which was only at the very beginning stages of comprehension when I first gave up on studying it. So I basically started from scratch - restarted Nukemarine\\'s memrise courses, restarted reading Tae Kim\\'s Grammar Guide, listened to trimsleur lessons (then I lost the files so if anyone has links I\\'d love to finish those eventually ;-; ). I started with trimsleur to jog my memory of some grammar and common words. Then went to the other 2 resources once I felt my chinese reading was good enough I wouldn\\'t confuse kanji readings with chinese hanzi readings.\\n\\nWell I did that for about a month. I ordered a game I was looking forward to, know it will have japanese language options, and have basically been preparing myself to try playing it in japanese by the end of April/beginning of May. I\\'m going to try and get myself to immerse much faster than I did last time. What motivated me even more? I have a friend who learned japanese well enough to translate novels/watch whatever they want etc, by studying Genki 1+2 and then simply trying to brute force read japanese novels and self-translate, and play video games and self-translate. That\\'s how they learned. So I know immersion helps from Refold, and immersion also helped my friend.\\n\\nI ended up watching lets plays in japanese (with auto generated japanese subs to help look up words) within a few weeks of starting. Lets plays of video games I knew already because I\\'d played in english, so the context helped a lot. The advice I\\'ve seen in Refold to immerse in things you have context for - it genuinely so helpful in lowering the difficulty curve and making immersion feel less \\'draining\\' at first. In chinese, reading the english translations beforehand literally put me from \\'can only follow main idea and a few details without a dictionary\\' with my favorite novels, to being able to follow nearly every detail and pick up a ton of new words with context to the point I only run into maybe 1 hard-to-figure-out word per page. So if you find immersion hard, at any stage, the advice to choose something you have prior context helps immensely - even if you haven\\'t gotten a refresher on the context in a while, you\\'ll still find a lot to be familiar and that will help you figure out a lot more words in context.\\n\\nThe other advice that really does help (probably obvious to some people, but not me apparently since I had to learn by trial and error ToT) - immerse in what you love. If you love it, its so much easier. Both because if you love it you find it easier to pay attention and more motivated to figure it out, and also because you may already have prior context for it which will help you know what\\'s going on. In japanese I\\'ve now immersed in some content I\\'ve seen in english, and some I never have - but the fact I\\'m passionately into all of it makes immersing so much easier than in the past. (And in chinese I immersed in some stuff I found boring but \\'easier\\' at first, and it never got me motivated to immerse as Often as when I just forced myself to start trying to read webnovels - much harder, but I had way more interest in reading these things I was interested in).\\n\\nImmersing in japanese from the beginning this time has been SO much more effective than in the past. Compared to how I tried to study last time years ago (when I barely immersed until year 2 and then only immersed maybe a dozen hours total in 6 months). And compared to how I studied chinese - I really COULD HAVE tried immersing in chinese earlier more often, but kept being scared by the difficulty. But doing it now in japanese, that \\'fear\\' was definitely slowing me down a bit.\\n\\nI also should have USED the benefit of prior context so much more in early chinese immersion. In japanese immersion it ups my comprehension level a LOT, and helps me figure out several words every so many minutes that are brand new - and catch most words I\\'ve studied and grammar I\\'m already familiar with. Whereas when I always did brand new things in chinese, and figured context would not help with chinese, I didn\\'t try some things as fast as I could have. Like I have a favorite novel in chinese I am reading through now that I am aware my prior context in english makes it so much easier to read - but I figured it would be so hard, because I\\'d tried reading it Before reading the english, that I put off trying to read it.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFIRST JAPANESE AUDIO IMMERSION:\\n\\nSo about a month into restarting japanese study, after about 3 hours overall of listening to lets plays of games I knew, I tried to watch a japanese musical I\\'d never seen before with no subtitles. It\\'s the japanese Dracula musical, with an actress playing Dracula, which I have wanted to watch for YEARS. I love the snippets I\\'ve seen on youtube and things I\\'d heard of it and wish I could find a dvd copy. Well, yesterday I found it on bilibili (a chinese site, so thanks chinese learning for helping me find japanese stuff! ToT). So I had to watch it!\\n\\nI had some prior context - I\\'ve read dracula, and seen the movie with Keanu Reeves. And the musical for the most part played out in the same scene sequence so I knew what was happening in most scenes (they changed the ending portion which was so cool though, also changed a few obvious story elements). I also had an intense love for the material - so I was invested in watching it and excited.\\n\\nIt\\'s the first time I\\'ve ever watched japanese content with no english or japanese subtitles. The first time I ever engaged in material requiring listening skill, with no kanji to rely on. \\n\\nSince I\\'ve restarted studying japanese, reading wise kanji has actually been a benefit since I learned maybe 2000 so far in chinese and so most kanji now look pretty familiar to me and I can now sometimes the meaning of words when I see the kanji that makes them. I no longer struggle to remember kanji\\'s appearance or meaning - its just the many readings I still drown in. I picked up some of my japanese manga the other day, and realized how much knowing hanzi helps me follow the individual speech bubbles and plot (which has never been this easy or comprehensible to me). So I realized I can maybe use manga to start learning the kanji readings, and pick up some words - although a lot of kanji do not actually mean the same thing as in chinese, and are used in more ways, so it only gives me some rough context or a hint usually. The main benefit of knowing hanzi is getting to skip that RTK stage where you try to memorize the rough meaning of many kanji.\\n\\nSo I started watching it, with no japanese subtitles to rely on, knowing only a couple hundred words (somewhere between 300-800 words). I had my imiwa dictionary app open, so I could hear some words and look them up - but since I was listening only, I think maybe I looked up \\'heart\\' \\'o-mae\\' \\'attracted\\' \\'daijoubu\\' \\'naze\\'. not very many words just mostly short ones I could for sure  recognize and keep hearing. I think the biggest benefit, was I heard a ton of words I\\'ve been studying or already knew and got to develop the skill of recognizing them in listening - grammar word endings, kanojo, otoko, london, kudasai, hajimemashite, gomen, watashi, mimi, boku, sore/sono/kore etc. Just hearing them in full sentences, practicing recognizing and identifying the parts of grammar I did understand and know already, helped a ton. I feel like I\\'m much more comfortable hearing and automatically recognizing those (especially the grammar structures) then my SRS app alone. \\n\\nThat is a huge benefit, that will most likely make japanese overall easier to \\'handle immersing\\' later on. Its really a matter of \\'immerse more\\' and it will get easier. I know its obvious, but I just mean - even as a beginner with only a few hundred words, just practicing doing it NOW will help so much. When I studied 2+ years one of the hardest part was EVEN when I knew words, and grammar, I had to pause and replay things and look up stuff and literally just stop to translate everything into english sentence order to even grasp the basics of what\\'s going on. I could not handle how different the japanese grammar structure is, especially in real time without pausing. \\n\\nSimply listening to lets plays lately without pausing, and watching this play without pausing, I\\'m Already noticing improvements in \\'automatically\\' being able to follow the parts I do recognize - instead of needing to slow down and re-order everything. I imagine all of you who already have been immersing from day 1 have been helped in this way a LOT more. \\n\\nI had to learn this lesson with chinese too - listening to audiobooks specifically required me to start internalizing the grammar in real time and words in phrase chunks instead of single units, and in watching shows if I didn\\'t want to constantly rely on catching the subtitles. With japanese I thought it was just going to be TOO different a language for this to work (Chinese grammar is mostly a similar order to english which makes this difference less \\'huge\\'). But like everything I\\'ve seen with immersion - just doing more, sooner, is helpful. Even if you think it will be too hard, you will recognize you can grasp a lot more than you think if you try consistently for a while. At least that\\'s how its been for me ToT.\\n\\nWatching the Dracula japanese musical has made me really excited! I\\'ve never watched anything japanese so long, especially without any subs - let alone without english subs (even the lets plays I watch are only 20-30 minutes). I\\'ve never been brave enough to try - and I learned just HOW much some related context and a passion for the material helps. I understood a lot more than I expected - like I mentioned, I recognized a lot of words/grammar I\\'ve studied, but also I managed to follow the main ideas of the plot changes! Which was really cool, and I loved those changes! I know from doing chinese and french, that re-reading and re-watching I tend to not struggle with basic plot and usually catch more specific details when immersing with the same content again. And it makes me super excited that knowing that, I\\'ll probably be able to follow even more if I watch it again! (And of course even more, if I watch once I\\'ve learned some more japanese). \\n\\nI also learned just how MANY japanese plays there are, that I\\'m curious about watching. This got me into a whole new thing I never figured I would enjoy so much, and makes me want to immerse not to study but because I want to experience them. There is a theatre troupe my friend loves called the Takarazuka Revue who has done a bunch of play adaptations with all women casts, and bilibili again happens to have a TON of them. A lot of anime I used to be into years ago have musicals, and I saw Death Note has one which I\\'m curious as hell about. One of my favorite video games, Nier: Automata, has two plays which have some plot relevance called YorHa Stage Play and YorHa Boys Stage Play and I have copies of them and have wanted to watch for a while because I love lore and characterization and the writing of that game and would love to see more content in that world. And so many things in this specific section of media have no subtitles (although a few do), so its super motivating on wanting to learn. It\\'s cool to know this whole world of things exists, and now that I realize I CAN follow a plot even with the little amount of japanese I know so far, I feel much less afraid to keep engaging with these materials right now instead of waiting. \\n\\nSo my point I suppose is - I\\'ve never run into a negative from immersing earlier. If anything, each time I make myself braver and try to do immersion earlier on, the more it seems to pay off. Slowing down how fast I immersed, because I was afraid of the \\'difficulty\\' has always just sort of slowed down my japanese. I\\'m grateful I tried to push past that with chinese eventually, or I would\\'ve repeated the same mistake. This time, I\\'ve been trying hard to just treat japanese as \\'doable\\' as any other language - as doable to understand in general. Just having this mindset has helped so much. Otherwise I wouldn\\'t have checked my manga and realized how much reading is actually something I can start doing right now. I wouldn\\'t have ever realized video games were doable with so few words unless I\\'d tried last time - and that\\'s why I\\'m going to make myself try again soon. My friend immersed in video games knowing only 1000 words and it worked for them! I know I did it before knowing only maybe 500 words at the time, and it worked somehow. This time, hopefully I\\'ll know at least 1000 before I start (because I\\'d like to be more prepared this time lol), but I already know its an option that is doable now. So try for a few hours, and see if it gets more doable than you thought it would be. I never expected I\\'d be able to tolerate 2 hours of nonstop japanese without pausing or subtitles but it happened. And now that I know, it\\'ll be less daunting next time.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSOME JAPANESE MUSICALS AND PLAYS:\\n\\nDracula Musical - I really recommend at least seeing some snippets of this one. Its one of the Dracula adaptations I like best (I also liked the one with Keanu Reeves, and the Bela Lugosi one). However if you can watch it in full, its worth it, as it changes some key points that\\'s more apparent later in the play. Youtube snippets: https://youtu.be/cN-CPrEuuJY (Dracula and Van Helsing), https://youtu.be/cgHojuWNf6U (Dracula and Johnathan Harker, Fresh Blood, one of the first songs and a familiar scene if you\\'ve seen the Coppula Dracula movie), https://youtu.be/acLYhIanVPU (Mina and Dracula), https://youtu.be/Z0vtAuvPkN0 (Dracula and Mina, Finale, if you do understand a lot of japanese you might want to skip this one for big spoilers on this play\\'s story differences). One of my favorite songs was actually Lucy\\'s song about her suitors actually, since the suitors were all so memorable and charming. I completely recommend this play if you\\'re into the Dracula story, vampires, and want to see how this adaptation handles it. A link to the full version on bilibili: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Fk4y1R75S?share_source=copy_web\\n\\nDeath Note Musical - I\\'ve loved Death Note over a decade and just found out it has a musical? Apparently it has an interesting origin where it was a japanese/american joint creation, then in america it did not receive the kind of reception to become a full production - but demo songs were already recorded. So it has a bunch of songs in english you can find. Then it WAS able to become a full production that was played in Japan and Korea - and the lyrics were translated into japanese and korean, with what seems to be both translations apparently adding more nuance back into the lines on some details. So the japanese and korean version are known as \\'more nuanced in line with source manga,\\' however the american version also has the same general feel if a bit more simplified. All 3 versions can be watched on youtube with english subtitles or without. Apparently the english L singer is quite impressive to people, the japanese writing nuance, and the korean version of the song \"Hurricane.\" Overall, the reviews I found of the musical indicate it does stay faithful to the source manga\\'s themes and concepts, while also changing the ending a bit along with some arcs in a way that\\'s satisfying for the play. Also in particular, Misa is fleshed out and more \\'enjoyable\\' by review accounts, Rem is explicitly in love with Misa and her love is a parallel to Misa\\'s love for Light - and also Rem in general is a contrast to so many of the selfish players in the story. So its cool to hear Rem was utilized more and in a way people found meaningful. The actor for the father is the actor from the original Death Note movie! And there\\'s two songs - one of him singing about if his son might be Kira, and one of Light\\'s sister singing about how she hates Kira and wishes he were like Light - and those songs generally are well loved and really hit home emotionally. I think it\\'ll be pretty cool to check out HOW it handles the same themes, and how it did the changes. I haven\\'t seen it yet but I\\'m immensely curious! I still am sort of blown away it exists! Death Note musical in japanese: https://youtu.be/G5ykQqz9JkI (it has hard subbed romaji for the songs, and if you want english subs click CC). Death Note musical in korean: https://youtu.be/5dbgA5Pf-nk (it has hard subbed english). Death Note musical with english concept songs: https://youtu.be/cD-kRYVQuuE (english hardsubs for the japanese dialogue portions, english songs). \\n\\nTakarazuka Revue theatre group: they\\'re a group of all women who do various plays, several quite loved ones like Phantom of the Opera and Elizabeth. My friend recommended Elizabeth. Here\\'s a snippet from the play: https://youtu.be/PcwuXLNW3N4 (no english subs). They did Romeo and Juliet (full play on youtube, no english subs): https://youtu.be/QFKjpxsxqR0 , https://youtu.be/ND_17zl6EXY . Phantom of the Opera (full play, japanese auto subs): https://youtu.be/on1hTo-pZPk . They apparently also did Phoenix Wright plays! https://youtu.be/JW_QJgiCMTI . They do so many well loved plays, I am not surprised my friend loves them!\\n\\nNier Automata Related Plays - related to the lore of Nier Automata, these stage plays are pretty cool if you\\'re into the game\\'s story. A lot of love went into them, and I\\'ve found snippets online. I would love to find dvds/blurays of these to own. The plays are: YorHa Stage Play, YorHa Boys Stage Play, YorHa Girls Stage Play (this one is the newest and dvds are not for sale yet though I would love to buy them when they come out if I can buy them from the US). This is the website, and you can buy official goods here (so here\\'s hoping they sell the dvds soon!). They have copies of the script which is really cool! https://yorha.com/ . Here\\'s a snippet of YorHa Stage Play intro (optional english subs if you click CC): https://youtu.be/CG0ZN0HqUzQ . Another snippet, of a different version of the play (there\\'s a few versions of each): https://youtu.be/Nj15o9fVuxw . With some digging, I was once able to find the full versions of the older YorHa plays but since then they\\'ve disappeared. If anyone has links where I could buy the official dvds, please let me know as I haven\\'t been able to find those yet either (I\\'m guessing yorha.com might sometimes have them at least that\\'s my hope). These particular plays are really cool if you are into Nier Automata, and there are also related novels if you\\'re curious - the novels are much easier to access, for sale in english and japanese (although I do not think the novels are the same exact story).', 'comments': []}]"
