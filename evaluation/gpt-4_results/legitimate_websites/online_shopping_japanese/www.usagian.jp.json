The reviews seem to pertain to a restaurant rather than a rabbit specialty store, but this could be due to the name \"Usagian\" being used by more than one entity. There is no specific information about the website in question from the search results. However, since the reviews are positive and there are no scam-related flags, this suggests that the name \"Usagian\" has a positive reputation.

The registrant is listed as Shigeru Wakida, and there are no signs of suspicious activity such as recent domain creation or anonymity services used excessively. The contact information is provided through a privacy protection service, which is not uncommon for legitimate businesses wanting to protect their privacy. The name servers are associated with shop-pro.jp, which could indicate the use of a shopping platform. There are no immediate red flags here. Since the WHOIS information does not indicate any suspicious activity and the domain has been registered for a significant amount of time, it seems less likely that the website is a scam. The reviews found online are positive and relate to Usagian as a physical location, though possibly different from the online store. No scam-related flags have been raised in the analysis so far. I should check one last source, such as social media, to see if there's any negative sentiment or scam accusations related to the website.",
