Many probably have friends, relatives or friends of friends who are also. If your in customer service you can probably identify a few of your customers as also part of the community. The LGBT community has begun the process of normalisation for decades with the last 1-2 giving the community a lot of public attention. The law was changed overnight. The gradual societal shift happened over decades.\\n\\nThe LGBT community is a big deal right now, you’d have to be living under a rock not to know what’s happening, right???\\n\\nYeah so, Japan... NONE of what just described has happened in Japan. Most Japanese can’t identify any one they know. As for celebrities there are a few, take Matsuko for example.

It’s clear internally that there is a notion that Japan is special and different. There is literally a Government campaign called “IS JAPAN COOL?” which honestly just comes across as insecurity. \\n\\nJapan is the most level headed player in the East, at least in my opinion, and in the coming years it’s probably going to need to take a serious leadership role to counter the endlessly financed CCP alternative.
