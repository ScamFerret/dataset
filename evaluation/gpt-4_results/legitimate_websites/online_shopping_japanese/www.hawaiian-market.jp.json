Hawaiian Airlines is arguably the least strategically positioned airline of any major US carrier. Back when planes needed to make a bunch of stops to get across the Pacific, basing an airline at Hawaii made a lot of sense. Now, that ``need to stop'' is eliminated, and other carriers have been chipping away at the only other comparative advantage that HA has left: Hawaii itself. HA currently trades at $29.XX. They report on 4/23 (https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/ha). I see them returning to at least $25.XX. \\n\\n---\\n\\n[1] Mainland competition. The introduction of LUV to the Hawaii market has radically increased capacity to the islands. Moreover, it's radically changed <pricing>. A variety of Twitter accounts exist solely to inform travelers of when cheap tickets are on sale for various destinations (Scott's Cheap Flights, Thrifty Traveler, TPG Alerts). Taking the last one, @TPG_Alerts tweeted Hawaii deals \\n\\n* 3 times in 2016\\n* 11 times in 2017\\n* 14 times in 2018\\n* 11 times in 2019 <so far>\\n\\nEach of the average deals in these tweets are flights to Hawaii from the West coast for just under $300. In comparison, HA's full-price standard economy fare is almost $600. More seats are going to Hawaii, and <far> more of them are competitive than HA's standard pricing.\\n\\n[2] Inter-island competition. The real leverage of the new LUV flights wasn't just in US -> Hawaii capacity. For the first time in a decade, HA is going to face competition on the flights it operates between the Hawaiian islands. See https://www.google.com/flights?lite=0#flt=HNL.OGG.2019-07-16*OGG.HNL.2019-07-19;c:USD;e:1;sd:1;t:f) (apologies if it doesn't share cleanly: it's a Google Flights search result). Between the most popular Hawaiian airports, HA operates a ridiculous twice hourly schedule. It's been able to dominate these with whatever fares it sees fit, given the exit of Aloha Airlines from the Hawaii market in 2008. But LUV now operates four daily flights between the two destinations, with plans to expand that capacity once the MAX is back in service. According to HA's 10-K, ``During 2018 , approximately 22% of our passenger revenue was generated from our Neighbor Island routes. Although we enjoy a strong competitive position on our Neighbor Island routes, our competitors could increase capacity to Hawaii either by introducing new routes or increasing the frequency of existing routes from North America to the Neighbor Islands or by the introduction of additional flights within the Neighbor Islands. This additional capacity could have the effect of decreasing our share of traffic on our Neighbor Island routes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.'' That's exactly what LUV will do, and for the first time, HA will be forced to guide about it explicitly.\\n\\nTo give an example of the price differential, HA had formerly charged $70 - $100 one-way for these fares. LUV debuted them at $49, forcing HA to match, driving down revenue in a former monopolized market.\\n\\nMoreover, there is no stopping other US carriers from doing the exact same (except operational constraints). Usually what protects geographic areas is something called Fifth Freedom rights, which generally limit the amount of domestic flying an international carrier can do in another country (i.e. why Emirates doesn't fly JFK -> LAX). But Hawaii <is> America. So Fifth Freedom rights wouldn't apply to American, United, Delta, or any other US-based carrier from operating inter-island flights. Each time capacity increases, HA's load factor goes down.\\n\\nMoreover moreover, there are no ultra-low-cost carriers serving hawaii yet (Spirit, Frontier, Sun Country, Allegiant). Any of them could announce service, and HA's hit would be significant.\\n\\n[3] Global competition. Low-cost carriers exist outside of LUV. Air Asia X started flights from Asia, HA's other big market, to Hawaii in 2018, increasing the service level later that year (https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2018/05/29/airasia-to-increase-flight-frequency-from-honolulu.html). The starting price for these tickets is $300 (for example to Osaka), compared to HA's $1,423. Moreover, other Asian carriers are expanding in Hawaii, like ANA's introduction of the A380 on service to Honolulu later this year (https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/hawaii24/airbus380/). According to HA's 10-K, ``During 2018 , approximately 26% of our passenger revenue was generated from our International routes. Our competitors on these routes include both domestic and foreign carriers.'' Losing market share on international routes would be difficult for them to move past. \\n\\n[4] Hawaii itself is expensive to operate in. HNL, Hawaii's biggest airport, is in the midst of a $3 billion renovation (https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2018/11/20/inside-the-hawaii-dots-3-billion-airport.html). Most of that renovation is paid for by increased by landing fees and airport rent rates. Hawaiian hits these costs doubly, as (as described above) a significant portion of its traffic is just flying from one island to another. Taken again from the 10-K, ``The State of Hawaii has begun to implement a modernization plan encompassing the airports we serve within the State. Our landing fees and airport rent rates have increased to fund the modernization program. Additionally, we expect the costs for our Neighbor Island operations to increase more than the costs related to our North America and International operations due to phased adjustments of the airports' funding mechanism. Therefore, costs related to the modernization program will have a greater impact on our operations as compared to our competitors, who do not have significant Neighbor Island operations.'' \\n\\n[5] HA is already slowing down. ``Highlights'' from FY 2018 included\\n\\n* Operating income of $314 million compared to $464 million in the prior-year period.\\t\\n* Pre-tax income of $301 million compared to $391 million in the prior-year period.\\n* GAAP net income of $233 million or $4.62 per diluted share compared to $331 million or $6.19 per diluted share in the prior year period.\\n* Adjusted net income of $275 million or $5.44 per diluted share compared to $289 million or $5.41 per share in the prior year period.\\n\\n[6] Global economic slowdown. Every. Single. Flight. that HA operates ultimately routes to Hawaii. If they guide towards negative economic outlook in 2019, especially if they use the R word, any adverse effect on tourism factors directly into their bottom line. Moreover, this guidance <explicitly concerns areas already slowing down> (i.e. Japan and SE Asia). From the 10-K again, ``Our business is highly dependent on tourism to, from, and amongst the Hawaiian Islands and our financial results could suffer if there is a downturn in tourism levels.''\\n\\n[7] Airlines were reporting major profits through all of 2017-2018, in no small part because oil was historically inexpensive. Prices in fuel have started to rally, which is airlines' biggest expense. Having to guide around fuel costs for the full year will be yet another bear catalyst. \\n\\n[8] The price is ... not terrible. HA recently got a bump in stock price because they released an 8-K that upped the <awful> guidance at the end of last year. Last year, HA guided for RASM to be down 3.0 to 6.0%; the updated guidance trimmed that to 3.0 to 5.0%. This caused the stock to bump $2. This is crucial, as I think it's the same $2+ they are going to lose when they report. \\n\\n---\\n\\nCaveats:\\n\\n[1] The stock has lost a lot already, making it hard to see a gigantic downward movement possible. \\n\\n[2] P/E is well below industry peers, so investors might be a little more lenient with the bear case outlined above. \\n\\n[3] You can search for the bull case based on technicals on your own (or, as a mod said, ``that gay ass link''). Do your own DD. I'm not an expert, and this is not advice. I just like writing. \\n\\n---\\n\\nTL;DR: if you could imagine the worst way to construct an airline for 2019, it would be to base it on a tourist island with little barrier to entry. That's what HA is. 5/17 26 P 0.60. HA might wander up in the next few days, making it even cheaper. Go longer if you want to be safer. HA is a stock I watch that absolutely deserves to be shorted every time it is over $33.\\n\\n---\\n\\nEdit: typos, added price example of inter-island flights.\", 'comments': ['The big killer of HA is Southwest Airlines starting to fly there as well as inter island. Those flights are cheap but it’s also a good amount of HA’s rev.', 'Everytime I see the commercial of their CEO with his corny bs tagline I cringe and think about shorting.
