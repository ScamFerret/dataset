The domain uses privacy protection services, which is not uncommon, and the status codes indicate that the domain is not set to be transferred or deleted. This information does not indicate a scam; however, to be thorough, I should check for customer reviews or any complaints about the website.

No overt signs of scam or fraudulent activity are stated in the search snippets.
