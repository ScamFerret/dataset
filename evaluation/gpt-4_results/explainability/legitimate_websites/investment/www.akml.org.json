    "question": "Please analyze this URL https://www.akml.org/",
    "thought": "To analyze if the URL is a scam, I should start by checking the content of the website. The website is accessible. Next, I should check the content for any of the scam characteristics. The extracted text does not show any immediate signs of the website being a scam. It appears to be related to the Alaska Municipal League, which is an organization for local governance. There are no unusually low prices, claims of free money, targeting of psychological weaknesses, non-existent company information, or inappropriate contact details. I should verify the legitimacy of this organization and check for any other signs of a scam. The search results indicate that the Alaska Municipal League (AML) is a recognized nonprofit organization that represents and supports local governments in Alaska. The URL in question appears to be the official site of AML, as it is listed in the search results and aligns with the other information found about AML. There is no evidence from the search results to suggest that the website is a scam. However, to be thorough, I should check the WHOIS record to ensure the domain's registration details seem legitimate and to see if there are any red flags there. I encountered an error retrieving the WHOIS information for the domain. This could be due to a temporary issue with the WHOIS service or with the domain itself. To continue the investigation, I should check the DNS records to ensure they are consistent with a legitimate organization's website. The DNS records retrieved for akml.org show that it uses domain control nameservers, which are common for many organizations. The presence of an MX record pointing to Outlook's mail protection service suggests that the organization uses a professional email service. The SPF record is also set up correctly to prevent email spoofing. There are no immediate red flags in the DNS records that would suggest the website is a scam. Since the WHOIS service returned an error, I will try to use the RetrieveCertificate tool to check the SSL certificate details for additional validation. The SSL certificate for www.akml.org is issued by Let's Encrypt, a widely-used certificate authority. The certificate is valid, with appropriate validity dates and no signs of abnormalities. Given the information from the search results, the content of the website, the DNS records, and the SSL certificate, there is no evidence to suggest that the website is a scam. It appears to be the official site for a legitimate organization, the Alaska Municipal League. I now know the final answer. The URL https://www.akml.org/ does not appear to be a scam website.",
