    "thought": "To determine if the URL is a scam website, I need to start by inspecting the site itself and its content. The status code 200 means the website is accessible. Next, I should analyze the content of the website to look for signs of a scam, such as unusually low prices, unrealistic financial claims, psychological triggers, and outdated information. The extracted text does not immediately indicate any of the scam characteristics. The website seems to be focused on insurance and retirement planning, which are legitimate services.

The contact information includes a phone number and an email address that match the domain, adding to the website's credibility. The domain is not on hold, indicating that it is active and not involved in legal disputes or issues that would raise red flags. To further confirm the legitimacy of the company, I should check for any complaints or scam reports related to this domain. The search results indicate that American Equity Investment Life Insurance Company has a presence in various financial and insurance review platforms, including Investopedia, SmartAsset, and BBB (Better Business Bureau). The company has been in business for several years, and while there are customer reviews and complaints as expected with any large company, there are no red flags indicating that the company operates a scam website. The reviews and company history suggest that it is a legitimate business. Based on the observations made during the analysis, there are no indicators that the website https://www.american-equity.com/ is a scam website. It has been established for a long time, the company information is consistent across different platforms, and it is registered with a legitimate physical address. The website content and contact information are appropriate for the type of business it claims to represent. I now know the final answer.
