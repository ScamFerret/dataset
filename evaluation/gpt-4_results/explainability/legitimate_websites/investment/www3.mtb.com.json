    "question": "Please analyze this URL https://www3.mtb.com/homepage/about-us/welcome-to-mandt/peoples-united/mobile-and-online-resource-center-personal",
    "thought": "To determine if the URL is a scam website, I will start by checking the content of the page and the status code to ensure the site is currently active and accessible. Since the website is accessible and returned a status code 200, it's time to analyze the content of the page to check for any of the scam characteristics mentioned. The extracted text seems quite extensive and does not show any immediate signs of the typical characteristics of a scam website. It appears to be related to banking information and FAQs, which could be legitimate. However, to further assess the legitimacy of the website, I should look into the domain information and see if there are any red flags there. The WHOIS information shows that the domain mtb.com is legitimately registered to M&T Bank Corp., with a physical address in Amherst, NY, and contact details that match a legitimate business entity. The domain has been registered since 2000 and is not set to expire until 2025, which adds to its credibility. There are no immediate signs of fraud based on the WHOIS data. To further ensure the legitimacy of the website, I will now check for any SSL certificate information to ensure that the website has a valid certificate for secure connections. It appears there is no information available from the RetrieveCertificate action for the domain www3.mtb.com. This could be due to a limitation of the tool or because the certificate information is not publicly available through crt.sh. Since the SSL certificate information is not available, I will proceed to check if there are any customer reviews or discussions on social media or forums that might indicate whether the website is a scam. This could include complaints or warnings from other users. The SearchReddit action did not return any results, which suggests that there may not be any significant discussions on Reddit regarding the URL www3.mtb.com being a scam. This could indicate that the website has not been flagged by users on this platform as suspicious. To corroborate the findings so far and to look for any broader user experiences or reports, I will now search on another social platform. The SearchX/Twitter action resulted in an error, preventing me from gathering information from Twitter regarding the website in question. Given the information obtained so far, the domain registration details appear legitimate and there is no evidence on Reddit to suggest the website is a scam. The extracted text from the website does not exhibit typical scam characteristics, and the domain has been registered for a long time with a legitimate company. Additionally, no SSL certificate information is available, which is not necessarily a strong indicator of a scam, but it could raise a question regarding the security of the site. Since the error with Twitter prevents me from obtaining further social proof, I will now make a final decision based on the available evidence. I now know the final answer. Based on the evidence gathered, I do not have sufficient reason to classify the URL as a scam website. The domain is legitimately registered to a known bank, and the content of the site does not exhibit scam characteristics. There is no social media evidence to indicate that the website is a scam.",
