    "question": "Please analyze this URL https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/us-eu/chicago.aspx?lang=eng",
    "thought": "The URL provided seems to reference a government site, specifically one related to Canada's international affairs, given the \".gc.ca\" domain. Scam websites typically don't use such domains, but I should verify if the content and domain information match what is expected from a legitimate government site. The status code 200 indicates that the website is live and accessible. I should now look into the domain's WHOIS information to ensure it's a registered government domain and not a spoofed site. The WHOIS data indicates that the domain 'international.gc.ca' is not found, which is unusual for a government website. However, this could be due to privacy practices or restrictions specific to government or official domains. Since it's a government domain, further investigation is required to confirm its legitimacy before making a conclusion. The extracted text seems to be consistent with what would be expected on an official government website. It includes a variety of services and information related to Canadian citizens, including passport services, visa and immigration services, and contact information for the Consulate General of Canada in Chicago. The presence of official government services, structured information, and contact details reduces the likelihood of it being a scam site. Additionally, there are references to Canadian holidays and an official modification date, which suggests the information is updated and maintained. The hyperlinks extracted from the webpage point to other official Government of Canada websites and services, which indicates that the site is part of a larger, legitimate network of government sites. This further supports the legitimacy of the URL in question. Based on the information obtained from the AccessURL, WHOIS, ExtractText, and ExtractHyperlink actions, I have enough evidence to determine the legitimacy of the URL. The URL https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/us-eu/chicago.aspx?lang=eng is not a scam website.",
