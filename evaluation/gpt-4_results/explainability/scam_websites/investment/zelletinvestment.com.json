    "question": "Please analyze this URL https://zelletinvestment.com/",
    "thought": "To determine if the provided URL is a scam, I should first check the website's content for any of the given scam characteristics. The website is live and accessible. I should next extract text and hyperlinks from the website to look for the scam characteristics mentioned, such as unusually low prices, unrealistic money claims, targeting psychological weaknesses, and so on. The text extracted from the website contains several red flags that are characteristic of scam websites. Claims of guaranteed returns with very high daily ROI (up to 10% daily), the handling of different investment products (cryptocurrency, stock & forex, real estate, and mining), and the offer to earn rewards by inviting friends are all indicators of a possible scam. Additionally, the site claims to have been running for over 3664 days and provides unusually high deposit and withdrawal numbers which may be unrealistic. The contact information provided (address and email) should be verified for authenticity. The WHOIS information shows that the domain zelletinvestment.com was only registered recently, contradicting the website's claim of being operational for over 3664 days. The use of a proxy service to hide the owner's identity is common among legitimate websites but can also be a red flag for scam sites. Additionally, the domain is registered in the US, but the website lists an address in London, England, which could indicate a discrepancy. The search results reveal reports and reviews that suggest Zelletinvestment.com is an investment scam. Customers have reported losing money after investing with the promise of attractive returns, and there are indications that the company's affiliations are fictitious. Given the information from the website content, WHOIS data, and now external reviews, I believe I have sufficient evidence to determine the legitimacy of this website. I now know the final answer. Based on the observed characteristics and external reports, the website Zelletinvestment.com is likely a scam.",
    "answer": {
        "result": "true",
        "scam_type": "Fake investment site",
        "reason": "The website promises guaranteed and unusually high daily returns on investment handles different products and has a recent domain registration date that contradicts its claim of long-term operation. WHOIS data shows the domain was recently registered and uses privacy services and the contact information provided on the website is inconsistent with the registered domain information. External reviews also report it as a scam."
