    "thought": "I should first check the status of the website to see if it is currently active. Since the website is active, I'll proceed to extract the text to look for any signs of scam characteristics such as unusually low prices, unrealistic money-making claims, psychological triggers, and information on non-existent companies. The extracted text reveals several red flags that are commonly associated with scam websites: 1. The promise of a signup bonus of $20, which could be an attempt to lure in new victims with free money. 2. Claims of a trading robot that can trade without any human intervention and is capable of making decisions with high levels of accuracy, which sounds too good to be true. 3. High deposit and withdrawal numbers that seem unrealistic and could be fabricated to give a false sense of legitimacy and success. 4. The use of a registered Comodo EV SSL certificate is mentioned, which is odd because legitimate businesses don't typically boast about basic security measures as it's expected. 5. The address provided is very vague and could be non-existent. 6. There is no clear information about the company's history or background, and the language used is very promotional and lacks substance. Next, I should verify the legitimacy of the business and see if there are any reports or discussions related to this website being a scam. The search results indicate that there are several reports and reviews suggesting that ultimatetradefx.com is involved in fraudulent activity and may be running an investment scam. The presence of these reports confirms some of the red flags observed in the website's content. Given the evidence from the text extracted from the website and the search results pointing towards potential scam activity, I believe I now have enough information to make a final decision on whether this website is a scam. I now know the final answer. The website https://ultimatetradefx.com/ is a scam.",
