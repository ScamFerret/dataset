    "question": "Please analyze this URL https://prospera-finance.com/",
    "thought": "I should first check the accessibility of the URL and general information about the website. The website is accessible. Now I should extract text from the webpage to look for any of the scam characteristics mentioned. The extracted text shows several potential red flags for a scam, including promises of daily profits and a very high return on investment (2% daily for 500 days), which is not typically possible in legitimate investments. They also offer a referral program that pays out high commissions, which can be indicative of a Ponzi or pyramid scheme. Before coming to a conclusion, I should look into the domain information to see if the company details are legitimate. The WHOIS information indicates that the website's registration details are hidden behind a privacy service, which is not unusual but can sometimes be a tactic used by scam websites to conceal their identity. The domain was also created very recently and has a short registration period, which can be a sign of a potential scam. Before concluding, I should check for any public complaints or reports about this website. It seems there was an error with the GetSearchResult tool. I will try a different approach to gather public opinion on the website by searching social media platforms. It seems there was no output from the SearchX/Twitter tool. This could mean that there are no recent tweets regarding \"prospera-finance.com scam.\" However, the absence of information on Twitter does not necessarily indicate legitimacy. Given the red flags from the text content and WHOIS data, I should try checking another social platform like Reddit before making a final decision. The Reddit search did not yield any direct claims of \"prospera-finance.com\" being a scam. However, the extracted text from the website and the WHOIS information have given me enough indicators to draw a conclusion. Based on the extracted text and the WHOIS information, I have identified several red flags associated with scam websites. The website promises unusually high and assured daily profits, which is unrealistic and a common trait of fraudulent investment schemes. The referral program with high commissions is indicative of a pyramid scheme. Additionally, the domain registration details are hidden behind a privacy service, and the domain itself is very new with a short registration period. These factors, combined with the unrealistic investment returns, lead me to conclude that the website is likely a scam. I now know the final answer.",

        "result": "true",
        "scam_type": "Fake investment site",
        "reason": "The website promises unusually high daily returns (2% daily ROI for 500 days) uses a high-paying referral program suggestive of a pyramid scheme and has hidden domain registration details indicative of an attempt to conceal identity. Furthermore the website's domain was recently registered and for a short duration which is commonly seen in scam setups."
