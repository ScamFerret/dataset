    "question": "Please analyze this URL https://sharkwale.com/",
    "thought": "I need to gather information about the website to check for scam characteristics. The website is accessible. Now I should look for content that might indicate if it's a scam or not. The extracted text from the website shows several potential red flags consistent with scam websites: 1. The website promises unusually high returns on investment, offering \"Weekly 10%\" and other high-yield investment plans. 2. It targets human psychological weaknesses by promising easy money through investment plans and referral systems. 3. The website claims to be associated with \"the world's leading digital asset trading platforms\" without providing substantial evidence or details about these associations. 4. The section on withdrawing money is vague, mentioning the need to \"follow our procedures\" and an \"understanding between Sharkwale and customers,\" which may indicate ambiguous customer information privacy. 5. The payment method includes an \"automatic gateway\" but lacks details, which could be considered unusual. The WHOIS information shows the domain was recently created, which could be a red flag. It uses a privacy service to hide the identity of the domain owner, which is common among both legitimate and scam websites. However, considering the nature of the promises made on the website, the recent domain creation date makes it more suspicious. Search results indicate that there are reviews and reports suggesting Sharkwale.com operates a fraudulent investment scheme. This aligns with some of the red flags observed in the website's content. With the information gathered from the website's content, WHOIS data, and search results indicating that it is a scam, I believe I can now provide a final answer. Based on the observed characteristics and the external information obtained, it is likely that https://sharkwale.com/ is a scam website.",
