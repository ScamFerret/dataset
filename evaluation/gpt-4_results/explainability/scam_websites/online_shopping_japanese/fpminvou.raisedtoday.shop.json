    "question": "Please analyze this URL https://fpminvou.raisedtoday.shop/",
    "thought": "To determine if the URL is a scam website, I need to gather information about the website's content, domain registration, reputation, and technical details. The website is accessible; I should now extract the text from the webpage to analyze the content for any signs of a scam, such as unusually low prices or suspicious claims. The website does not contain any text because it returned a 404 Not Found error, which indicates that there is no webpage content at the URL provided. This could be a red flag as it suggests the website may not be a legitimate retail or service provider. However, I will need more information to make a final determination. I'm unable to retrieve WHOIS information directly. This could be a temporary issue or it might indicate privacy measures that could be used for legitimate purposes or by scam websites to hide their identity. I should check the DNS record to gather more technical details about the domain. The DNS record contains only an HINFO record with \"RFC8482\", which is a placeholder response and does not provide any meaningful information about the domain's DNS setup. This could be a strategy to obscure the domain's real DNS information. Given the current findings, I need to investigate the domain's reputation and see if there are any reports of it being involved in scams. The search results suggest there are complaints and warnings about low prices and potential scam activities associated with the domain raisedtoday.shop. The Better Business Bureau warning and other reviews indicate that this domain may be involved in scamming activities. Given that the website returned a 404 error when attempting to extract text and there are no hyperlinks to analyze, it seems that the website may not have content or it may be intentionally hiding its content, which could be consistent with a scam operation trying to evade detection. The certificate information shows that the domain has a valid SSL certificate issued by Let's Encrypt, which is common for both legitimate and scam websites. The presence of an SSL certificate alone cannot confirm the legitimacy of a website. Based on the observations from the DNS record, WHOIS retrieval error, the 404 Not Found error for the website's content, and the search results indicating complaints and warnings about potential scam activities, I have enough information to make a determination about the website. I now know the final answer. The URL https://fpminvou.raisedtoday.shop/ is likely a scam website.",
    "answer": {
        "result": "true",
        "scam_type": "Fake shopping site",
        "reason": "The website returned a 404 Not Found error indicating no content which is suspicious for an e-commerce site. The DNS record contained only an HINFO RFC8482 placeholder suggesting an attempt to obscure actual DNS information. Search results revealed warnings and complaints associated with the domain suggesting scam activities. These factors align with several characteristics of scam websites such as lack of updated information targeting human psychological weaknesses and handling different products from common e-commerce websites."
