    "question": "Please analyze this URL https://nice-beach-0e8ff0b10.5.azurestaticapps.net/Win08ShDMeEr0887/index.html",
    "thought": "To analyze if the provided URL is a scam, I should first check the accessibility and content of the website. Since the URL returned a 404 status code, it means the page could not be found. However, this does not immediately confirm whether the site is a scam or not. It could be that the page is temporarily down or has been removed. To further investigate, I should check the domain's WHOIS information to understand the registration details and see if there are any red flags. The WHOIS information indicates that the domain is registered to Microsoft Corporation, which appears to be legitimate. However, the specific subdomain and path provided in the URL might be used for malicious purposes despite the main domain being owned by a reputable company. To further investigate, I should check if there are any commonalities with known scam websites or any reports of scams related to the URL provided. The search results indicate that there are reports and discussions about scams using Microsoft Azure's static web apps service, which aligns with the domain in the URL provided. Given this context, I should now look for any specific mentions or reports connected to the exact URL or pattern of the URL in question. There are no specific Twitter mentions of the exact URL provided that could indicate a scam. However, based on the previous observation that there are known scams using a similar domain pattern, further investigation is needed. It would be prudent to retrieve certificate information to see if there are any irregularities that could suggest a scam. There is no certificate information available for the subdomain provided. This is unusual for a legitimate website, especially one under the azurestaticapps.net domain, which should have a valid SSL/TLS certificate if it was actively being used for secure and legitimate purposes. While the lack of certificate information alone does not confirm a scam, it does raise suspicion when combined with the previous findings. Given the information I have gathered so far, I should now search Reddit to see if there are any reports or discussions related to this URL or similar patterns. There are no Reddit discussions or reports related to the exact URL provided. However, the absence of such discussions does not necessarily mean the site is legitimate, especially considering the previous observations about scams using similar domain patterns on Microsoft Azure's service. It is important to note that the URL could be part of a very recent or low-key scam operation that hasn't been widely reported yet. Given the lack of specific information about the URL, I will need to rely on the general indicators of scam websites and the context provided by the search results and WHOIS information to make a final determination. I now know the final answer. Although there is no direct evidence of scam activity associated with the exact URL provided, the context of known scam patterns using similar Azure static web apps and the lack of certificate information for a domain that should typically have it suggest that the URL could be part of a scam operation. Since the URL is not currently accessible and there is no concrete evidence of legitimate activity, I am inclined to classify it as a potential scam based on the provided characteristics. The URL https://nice-beach-0e8ff0b10.5.azurestaticapps.net/Win08ShDMeEr0887/index.html is potentially a scam website.",
    "answer": {
        "result": "true",
        "scam_type": "Fake shopping site",
        "reason": "The URL follows a pattern known to be used in scams associated with Microsoft Azure's static web apps service as indicated by search results. The WHOIS information does not raise immediate red flags but the lack of certificate information and the inaccessibility of the URL suggest it could be part of a scam operation especially considering the domain should normally have a valid SSL/TLS certificate if used for legitimate purposes."
