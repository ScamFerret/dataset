During the trade in process i marked that it was damaged, and it still said i will be getting $800. Few weeks later after they got my trade in and i got my new phone, they took the promo completely off and i owed full price. I had to call into customer support for 2 hours for them to tell me i will actually be getting $500 for my damaged phone. Not ideal, but i thought i'll take what i can get.

So i called into att support again, got all the way up to a manager, and they essentially told me too bad. Every employee i spoke to told me i would get a certain trade in value, and now that the time is here they just go back on their word? I can't believe att can just do that to people, it feels like they're scamming me.
