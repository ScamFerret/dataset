Furthermore, the domain's registrant information is redacted for privacy, and there's no clear information available about the business or individual behind the website. The domain is also registered through WhoisGuard, which is commonly used to provide privacy; however, it can also be a tactic to hide the identity of a potentially fraudulent site operator. The fact that the domain is set to be deleted soon is questionable for a legitimate business. Given the suspicious nature of the domain status and the lack of transparency in ownership, it is reasonable to suspect that this site may not be trustworthy.
