After a bit of inquiring, he said that it was for $46/hour w/ no experience necessary, and that he was going to try to get it too. It sounded too good to be true, but it was none of my business.\\n Fast forward to today, he told me his girlfriend got the job, and they sent her a check that she was about to cash (~$2400) to buy equipment. IMMEDIATELY I remembered that post, and fortunately I was able to find it and show him this is a common scam. I didn\\'t want to rain on their parade or seem jealous that she got a \"well paying job\", so I told them just to call the bank on the check just to be sure.

They send you a fake check, but the bank lets it go through for your own convenience; you then buy the scammer\\'s \"equipment\" (the vendor you get the equipment is also a scam, just to get your money, you never get the supplies that you payed for), but the bank eventually figures out the check is bogus, takes the full amount out of your account, even if you go negative in which case they\\'ll demand you pay the amount asap or forgo repercussions.\\n', 'comments': ['I think the biggest takeaway from these types of scams is the check.

So I press 2 and a woman is on the other line saying she works at Verizon Wirelss and fraudulent activity may have been found on my account. She asks me if I ordered an Iphone XS to North Caroline.

I then hung up on her and called Verizon with the number from their website just to be sure there was no fraud, and of course there wasn\\'t.\\n\\nWhat these people did is they went to VerizonWireless.com and entered my phone number into the username/password login form. You can login with your number on vzw. So they put in my number and click forgot password, which resets your password and texts you a new one.
