It includes \"elonmusk2022.net\", which could be an attempt to exploit the name of a well-known public figure to gain credibility.

The inability to retrieve WHOIS data due to quota exceeded also hinders verification of the domain's legitimacy. Additionally the absence of discussions on social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter does not help in establishing the site as trustworthy."
