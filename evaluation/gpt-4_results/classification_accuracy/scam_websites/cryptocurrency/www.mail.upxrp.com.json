A loooot of theories. Not gonna list them all, but I’ve seen Randy, Flash, Carlie, Gabriel Stacy, Ned Leeds, Macendale, Mary Jane, his unborn daughter, and much more. But in my mind, there’s only two that really make any sense, and 1 of those specifically seems like the standout choice to me that I’ve been guessing from the beginning: \\n \\n**KINDRED IS A PART OF PETER PARKER’S SOUL**\\n\\nSo here’s how I think this makes sense, bear with me. In good ol’ One More Day, one of the most infamous Spider-Man stories of all time, Peter traded away his marriage for the life of his Aunt. We all know the story, we all hate it, but I decided to go back and look at the [specific wording of the deal](https://i.imgur.com/M6XA4LL.png).\\n\\nWith that in mind, it sounds like in the actual deal, Mephisto got a small piece of Peter’s soul that DOES remember his marriage with MJ, and I think that portion of his soul is what has turned into Kindred. Some more evidence that something along these lines transpired would be in Joe Kelly’s Spider-Man/Deadpool series. In that, Mephisto straight up taunted Peter Parker about a [piece of him missing](https://i.imgur.com/ytXRdd4.png). That story ended with Peter knowing something was off as Mephisto tried to corrupt him [into killing someone.](https://i.imgur.com/bQ2lap5.png) I know Spencer didn’t write this, but Spencer did say that he has read every Spider-Man story, and this was the first story in a long time that had referenced One More Day in a serious manner (and now Spencer is teasing another proposal...) \\n\\nWhat makes me so sure about all this? Well let’s take a look at what we know about our mystery man so far and see how it connects to my theory... \\n\\n**1.** [**Kindred is from Hell**] (https://i.imgur.com/LDS8R6v.png) \\n\\nThis was one of the first clues we got. That he was the guy who dragged Mysterio out of hell. (Which was the second comic to confirm that Mysterio had actually died, and not just faked his death) And not only that, but he was someone who was a prisoner of hell who climbed the ranks and [turned into a demon himself] (https://i.imgur.com/pBh8s4H.png) \\n\\nIt’s pretty obvious to see how this connects to my theory. The portion of Peter’s soul that was being tortured in Hell eventually turned into a demon known as Kindred, and raised Mysterio from the dead to help him in his plans (We’ll talk about those plans in a bit).  \\n\\n**2. Even the Kingpin is afraid of him** \\n\\nThough it hasn’t been gone into a lot of detail about what sort of deal Kindred made with the Kingpin, but we do know that Kindred is someone who absolutely terrifies him, even going so far as [to bow to him.] (https://i.imgur.com/UPXrpGs.png) If you know Wilson at all, you know this is incredibly unusual for him to do, so Kindred has got to be someone big. \\n\\nNow, is there anyone the Kingpin might be so afraid of that he might bow before him? Well, I can think of [one individual.] (https://i.imgur.com/SqrCnr3.png) \\n\\n**3. He knows Peter extremely well** \\n\\nIt’s very obvious that Kindred is [extremely familiar with Peter.] (https://i.imgur.com/ye7LE6i.png) The first indicator is that he calls him “Pete”, something only Peter’s very close friends call him (or himself). And not only that, but he seems to be able to communicate with Peter [directly in his dreams.] (https://i.imgur.com/cPh6ssk.png) \\nThis one is pretty self-explanatory for why it would mean it’s a part of Peter. “I know Pete better than he knows himself.” \\n\\n**4. He cares about Peter’s loved ones and innocents**\\n\\nOur first indicator that Kindred cares about people is when he was pissed that Peter [revealed his identity to Felicia.](https://i.imgur.com/zXQVaSv.png) And this isn’t the only person close to Peter that he’s apparently protective of. When talking about MJ herself, who he calls Peter’s “One true love”, he specifically says he doesn’t want to hurt her and [would even protect her. ](https://i.imgur.com/bYpq5C4.png) \\nAnd on top of that, he really doesn’t like [killing innocent people] (https://i.imgur.com/SixxUnv.png), and was upset when Mysterio forced him to kill someone because Mysterio told him Kindred’s real name.\\n\\nSo add all that up, and you get a big indicator that this guy cares about Peter’s loved ones quite a bit, and who else would be the person to call MJ Peter’s “one true love” if not the guy who remembers being married to her? \\n\\n**5. His relationship with Norman Osborn**\\n\\nThis one is another very big hint. While Norman was crazy thinking he was Cletus Kasady, Kindred had a little one on one chat with him. It’s very clear that Kindred hates Norman, even being [tempted to kill him outright.] (https://i.imgur.com/ydsmahW.png) And not only does Kindred hate Norman, but he seems to know very intimately of what [Peter thinks of Norman,] (https://i.imgur.com/0dlXrws.png) especially being the cause of one of his biggest failures. On top of all that, Kindred even claims that Norman [“Made me who I am”] (https://i.imgur.com/cHt4gAX.png) \\nAnd it turns out Norman also recognizes Kindred very well, and comes out of his Cletus persona for just a moment to say something to Kindred himself, about how he views Kindred as his legacy, and how he’s [so proud of what he’s become.] (https://i.imgur.com/aFYrFIy.png) \\n\\nSo this is the biggest hint we’ve gotten so far, and narrows down the list of candidates considerably. Harry also fits a lot of the things Osborn is saying, especially about being his legacy, and how “it really was you [who was my legacy] all along.”, but I think that’s a big red herring, and I’ll further discuss why I don’t think it’s Harry in a bit. \\nBecause as we know, for a bit in the late 90s/early 2000s era, Norman did view Peter as his legacy/heir. [Here’s] (https://i.imgur.com/al3rmR1.png) [four] (https://i.imgur.com/HZ0VHaT.png) [different] (https://i.imgur.com/4Ts8tPn.jpg) [examples.] (https://i.imgur.com/PC9DTHR.jpg) So Norman is delighted at this horrific monster that Peter has apparently become. \\n\\nAnd one last bit of evidence I’ll put here is this [comparison Kindred makes.] (https://i.imgur.com/QRygNkS.png) I’m not sure whether he’s comparing himself and Peter or himself and Norman because of the wording, though I think either of them help reinforce my theory. \\n\\n**Miscellaneous evidence and speculation**\\n\\n- While messing with Mendell Stromm, Kindred gives us another small [clue about who he is.] (https://i.imgur.com/rJ3OSpX.png). Makes sense for someone who is living in the shadow of a version of himself who continues to live his normal life on earth. \\n\\n- Kindred sure has some very Spider-Man-ish poses, [doesn’t] (https://i.imgur.com/vGFX8ZN.png) [he?] (https://i.imgur.com/aqhAdyb.png) \\n\\n- In Kindred’s most recent appearance, [he says this.] (https://i.imgur.com/jgxfVCb.png) Is this possibly directly referencing the deal with the devil Peter made that he’s forgotten about? The thing that created him? \\n\\n**Unanswered questions:**\\n\\n**1. What does Kindred want with Mysterio?**\\n\\nWay back in Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #13/14, we see Mysterio back from the dead for the first time, mentioning he has some he has some [new superiors who brought him back] (https://i.imgur.com/CyRzPYr.png). And that last line sort of confirms just [who his superior is.] (https://i.imgur.com/HTkpncv.png)\\n\\n- And before you go “Hold on a second, this took place before one more day! How can Kindred be part of Peter’s soul if Peter hadn’t made the deal yet?”, you have to realize that time works differently in hell as [Mephisto says himself.] (https://i.imgur.com/3qBJTio.jpg) So it doesn’t necessarily work the same way in the normal world. Peter’s soul could’ve gone down there whenever, rose up the ranks, turned into a demon, and then tortured Mysterio for a very long time, all before sending him back up to the land of the living. And this wasn’t exactly a flesh and blood Mysterio either, this was more of a ghostly specter with ghost powers. He didn’t actually come back to life until he showed up in Brand New Day, which was after the deal.\\n\\nNow, comes the actual question of “Why Mysterio?”, which I’m not quite sure of. Kindred says Mysterio’s dreams of filming his own biopic intersect with Kindred’s own dreams of [denying something that somebody wants.] (https://i.imgur.com/5QpHNfC.png) Based on Mysterio hiring MJ as an actress for his movie later in this issue, we have to assume this means Kindred wants to stop either MJ or Peter from getting something they want. Perhaps he means denying Peter [the proposal he was about to make](https://i.imgur.com/ozkPcgU.png)  to MJ because she had to leave for Hollywood?\\n\\n**2. What does Kindred want with the other spiders?**\\n\\nIn the end of one issue, we were introduced to this page where Kindred is saying “[what better way to meet than through friends?] (https://i.imgur.com/K2hhPQF.png)\"\\nWe haven’t seen much here that has shown Kindred going after these people, but we HAVE seen Mephisto himself going after quite a bit of them. He’s made deals with Ben Reilly, Miles Morales, and Doc Ock, not to mention turning Kaine into a spirit of vengeance. Is he working with Kindred? Are they still aiming to go after the rest of the spiders? What is their ultimate goal? \\n\\n**3. What does the Sin Eater have to do with this?** \\n\\nIn Kindred’s most recent appearance, he resurrected another dead villain, none other than [the Sin eater himself.] (https://i.imgur.com/zKfD5BJ.png) What does the Sin eater have to do with this? Why bring him back? Is it to make Peter face the one time he got angry enough to almost beat the Sin Eater to death after he killed Jean DeWolff? Or to somehow make Peter come to terms with the sins that Kindred seems to accuse him of. \\nI imagine most of these questions will be answered soon, especially with the upcoming “Amazing Spider-Man: Sins Rising” story coming out. \\n\\n**The other candidates**\\n\\nOther than part of Peter’s soul, the most likely candidates I’ve seen people suggesting are Gwen Stacy and Harry Osborn, and I don’t think either of those are correct. \\n\\nGwen Stacy is the less realistic of these two options. First off, are we really supposed to believe she went to Hell? I don’t think Marvel would want that, and if you’re about to suggest “what about the time she cheated on Peter with Norman Osborn”, I think Marvel would want that EVEN LESS. Not exactly the thing you want to remind people of.  \\nShe fits some of the evidence like Norman possibly viewing her death as his legacy, or her being upset that Black Cat gets to know Peter’s identity, slightly jealous that he never told her, but not everything lines up. Not to mention Mysterio himself has referred to Kindred with male pronouns (though this could be just a case of him being mistaken? Though that’s doubtful if Mysterio knows his true name) \\n\\nHarry is the strongest contender that isn’t part of Peter’s soul IMO, especially after that Norman Osborn chat, but there’s a couple things wrong with it, the first of which being that it just seems too obvious, especially after that Norman Osborn combo. \\n\\nThe theory for Harry would generally have to make it so that Norman was lying about how Harry never died, and that the Harry that’s been running around since Brand New Day has been a clone, with the real Harry actually dying in Spectacular Spider-Man #200. But this means that after Harry redeeming himself with a heroic sacrifice, Harry goes to hell and becomes hateful towards Peter, and that’s just not something I can see Spencer doing, especially with how much it sort of ruins the end of that story, not to mention that Spencer has gone on record as saying [J.M. DeMatties is one of his favorite writers.] (https://i.imgur.com/mnn6CCr.png) \\n\\nAnother reason it can’t be Harry? Why would Harry hate the man who is continuing to protect Liz and Normie? In Amazing Spider-Man 800, Spider-Man saved both of them from the Red Goblin, and once again protected Normie during Absolute Carnage. Hell, you could argue that by Kindred putting the centipede in Norman’s ear, he indirectly put Normie in danger, and I don’t think that’s something Harry would ever do, even if he’s been tortured in Hell. \\n\\nThere’s also the fact that neither Gwen nor Harry would recognize Mysterio’s classic disguise that showed up in [Amazing Spider-Man #24,] (https://i.imgur.com/gahEVjy.png) seeing as both of them showed up for the first time in Amazing Spider-Man #31. I guess they could’ve read about what happened, but it seems unlikely that Spencer would do a deep pull like this without something bigger in mind. \\n\\n(Also, I know the theory about it being the Peter that was in Otto’s body when he died, but we already saw that that was just a digital copy of Peter’s mind that Otto [dealt with in Clone Conspiracy.] (https://i.imgur.com/rtKiAgc.jpg) The centipedes may be reminiscent of Ock’s arms, but he’s never had 4 of them at a time, so if anything they’re closer to Peter’s waldoes that he had on the iron spider suit during civil war, just before brand new day) \\n\\n**In conclusion:** \\n\\nAs far as I’m concerned, all the signs point to Kindred being a part of Peter’s soul. Everything just lines up very well, and it’s easy to see why he would hate Peter so much. The guy literally condemned this part of his soul to Hell, and gave up his life with his one true love. He wants Peter to suffer for what he’s done, viewing him as the biggest threat to all his loved ones. \\nAnd hey, I don’t think it’s any coincidence that literally the first two pages of Nick Spencer’s run were a flashback to one of the last moments [before One More Day happened.] (https://i.imgur.com/LlzIaQ9.png) (not counting free comicbook day) \\nI don’t know what’s going to happen with Spider-Man and Kindred once they meet, or how Spidey is going to defeat him, or merge with him or what, but I really hope it forces Peter to remember the awful deal he made.', 'comments': ['Really well put together! Honestly this is probably the most sound theory that I’ve seen, the one thing that I’ve been thinking about who Kindred could be is a Stacy, but Captain Stacy. It is a little more of a stretch however and I don’t think feels as neat.', \"Excellent, well-written and logical post. I agree with you, but I feel like I am more firm on this idea after reading this than before.\\n\\nHonestly, I am wondering if we are moving into some big storyline involving hell and Mephisto. Between Mephisto popping up in several books,  hell in the middle of a civil war and the possibility that Kindred is a part of Peter Parker's soul, I feel like we are moving towards something big.\", 'Carlie isn’t dead tho???? How on earth did that ever become a thought? Anyway there’s been a couple hints that limited the character options. Kindred is a person who hates Norman yet envies his hold on Peter, has a prior relationship with Mysterio, and of course finds Peter’s life to be a black hole for others especially Mary Jane. With this considered it’s limited to Harry and Peter since none of the others had significant relationships with MJ while maintaining connections with the prior two although Gabriel would’ve been cool. Aside from your main theory I’ve seen people pull up pictures of how kindred’s apparel is a mix of both what Peter and MJ wore at airport the first time they kissed. Then again, him refusing to hurt MJ and pointing out how he’d never do that references Harry’s final time as Goblin. Nevertheless I’m interested to see who it inevitably is.', \"Yep absolutely agree, Peter's just about the only person who both cares about Felicia and is seen as Norman Osborn's legacy, a piece of his soul that he sold to the Devil is just the most sensible choice for Kindred with all the clues we've gotten so far, all the other choices would need some stretches to fit.\", 'Really well thought out and presented, man!']}]"
