Claims of high leverage (100X), promises of a stable and guaranteed weekly income, and a mention of a \"guaranteed\" range of options to make the most off your investment are unrealistic and target human psychological weaknesses for quick and easy money. The presence of these claims warrants a deeper investigation into the legitimacy of the website.",
