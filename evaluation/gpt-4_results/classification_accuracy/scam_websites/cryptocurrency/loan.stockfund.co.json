This situation is highly unusual for a legitimate business website, as they would ensure their domain registration is active and not at risk of deletion.

The domain was registered in 2019 and appears to have been updated recently in 2024, but this does not negate the current pendingDelete status. Given the current state of the domain and the lack of information on the website itself, it is plausible to suspect that the website might have been involved in scam activities or is not a legitimate business.
