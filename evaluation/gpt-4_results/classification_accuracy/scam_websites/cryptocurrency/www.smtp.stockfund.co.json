Another result mentions an investment plan with an unusually high return (101% after 1 day), which is a common characteristic of Ponzi schemes and could indicate a scam. This result is more relevant as it directly references stockfund.co. Given the WHOIS status of pending deletion, the previous suspension of the domain, and the search result suggesting an investment scam, there is enough evidence to conclude that the URL is likely associated with a scam.
