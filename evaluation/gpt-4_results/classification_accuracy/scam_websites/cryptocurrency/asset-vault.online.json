Yes, there are some optimizations that only programers can do like reworking the shadow algorithms, or optimizing the 3D rendering pipline... However, there are plenty of other tasks where artists are involved that would improve the performance and the experience of the game:\\n\\n### 1.Recreate 3D assets with lower polycount and textures with less resolution\\n\\n\\nThe number of polygons of 3D objects and the resolution of textures are a huge factor in making assets look good but also have a negative impact on performance. However that\\'s just the canvas the artists work on, you can make better or worse art with it. **It is possible to spend effort into remaking the current assets to obtain results that are just as good as the originals but use a fraction of its original polygons/pixels**. And considering this game has a lot of **cheaply bought assets this should not be hard to achieve** for a full-time dedicated art team.\\n\\nWe have an example of this when Riot Games reworked their main map a few years ago. You can read their dev-blog explaining how the artists helped make the map not only **more beautiful but also more performant** here:\\n\\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/dev-blog-optimizing-rift\\n> Usually, when players think about how a game performs on their rig, they mostly look at the game’s tech. In reality, performance involves tight collaboration between artists and engineers, aimed at finding ways to implement art in an efficient fashion.\\n\\n\\n### 2. Programmers are not artists, optimizing how good something looks and feels involves artists\\n\\nWe, as players, take for granted the work that goes into game engines. We just assume that you model some objects, paint some textures, create some animations and together with some gameplay programming you got a game. However when you get to it the engine you bought only gets you so far and there is a lot of tech and tools that you need custom built for your needs. Like a custom animation transition system (remember how long vaulting took?). Or detection to make characters properly step on stairs steps. Or all the tech involving particles and VFX.\\n\\nThese and many other examples are tasks that involve the collaboration between programmers and artists. That is why there are devs in the role of **\"Technical artist\"** which bridge these hybrid needs. \\n\\nHere\\'s some talks of artists explaining how they created efficient art using new tech or smart implementations.\\n\\n[Technical Artist Bootcamp: The Elder Scrolls Online\\'s Character Tools and Pipeline](https://youtu.be/EdDotYUpydE?t=309)\\n\\n[Technical Artist Bootcamp: The VFX of Diablo](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1017660/Technical-Artist-Bootcamp-The-VFX)\\n\\n[The Animation Pipeline of Overwatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr7oO8kDu8g)\\n\\n[[PDF] Between Tech and Art: The Vegetation of \\'Horizon Zero Dawn\\'](https://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/gdc2018/presentations/gilbert_sanders_between_tech_and.pdf)\\n\\n### 3. There is a LOT of pending art work to do in the game.\\n\\nEven beyond the subject of performance, there is a lot of art that needs work, for example:\\n\\n* The trees move. That\\'s because the different levels of detail (LOD) models of the tree are not properly aligned. Have your junior modeler align them. Also this happens because the trees are cheap assets. They should replace all of those bad assets. **A game this size should not have this much in common with an \"asset-flip game\".**\\n\\n* \"Mushy\"/melted buildings happen because the engine has to algorithmically come up with a low level of detail version of the buildings. They should make those low LOD assets instead of running with the default approximation. Making some simple cubes with well defined low res textures would be a HUGE step up from mushy buildings.\\n\\n* Remeber when Bluehole proudly presented their custom healing animations? Yeah, the thumb goes through the syringe when applying a first aid while prone. They had one job, make a few animations, and this is the quality they can muster?\\n\\n* The game looks ugly for today\\'s standards and runs badly for how ugly it is. Sure having 100 players and a big map are big challenges, but even on situations of low character count and the player staying on the same area the relationship performance-prettyness is horrible.\\n\\n* Have I already said that this game should not be riddled with bought assets? Yeah.\\n\\n### 4. On the other hand, programmers should be working on performance/gameplay/netcode not on the crate system\\n\\nAgain we take for granted how hard is to implement things. The crate system is not rocket science but it needs programming work. From implementing and supporting a store selling crates by the millions. To authenticating crate oppenings and make sure you can\\'t hack those. And implementing memory optimizations and tech to be able to have multiple skins for the same weapon, and weapons changing skins when picked up. As well as implementing and reworking the different UIs to support all crate related systems.\\n\\nAll of that work programming effort could be put into almost any aspect of this game and you would get better results from it. You would get a bigger improvement, at the cost of crate profits (arguably).\\n\\n', 'comments': ['The amount of effort put into shitting on eachother’s posts in this sub is astounding.\\n\\nGood points though.', 'I miss the days when games were primarily monetized through sales. It forced the devs to make a good game and continue making it better to attract new plays.  Now its about tricking your existing playerbase into dumping extra money into it.   The motivations for development completely shift from improving the product, to implementing gimmicks that cost money.', \"In bluehole's defence PUBG is just an asset-flip game that got lucky.\", 'Interesting read - I learned something new thanks.\\nI hope, think and expect optimization to be number 1 prio. \\n\\nOptimizations include:\\n\\nNetcode\\n\\nPerformance (Fps )\\n\\nBug fixes (like the ads bug) \\n\\nGameplay optimizations (proper tweaks to damage model, 556 assault rifles etc etc)', 'This is unusually accurately argumented. The only thing I\\'d just mention here is regarding point #4 - perf/netcode/gameplay optimization is *generally* a different area of expertise than building UI\\'s and backend systems, which is what would be mostly involved in setting up those crate systems and such. As such, they would most likely be separate people working on these aspects.\\n\\n(There is likely to be some spillover from the above work to artists though, but at this point the texturing and modeling related systems are probably 99% in place requiring no further work from \"gameplay developers\")\\n\\nBut other than that, good points.']}, {'title': 'Protecting Your Digital Wealth: The Importance of Offline Crypto Storage', 'subreddit': 'VaultguardVaultG', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultguardVaultG/comments/17lkbo4/protecting_your_digital_wealth_the_importance_of/', 'selftext': '&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7oenj8m9hsxb1.jpg?width=1501&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d7501d6f3e9233034aea8a3538388e44059a68f\\n\\n \\n\\nIn the age of digital currency, safeguarding your crypto assets is paramount. Imagine walking around with thousands of dollars in cash — it’s highly unlikely you would do so, for fear of theft or loss. Similarly, the security of your cryptocurrencies should be a top priority, as they are the modern equivalent of carrying a substantial amount of wealth in your digital wallet.\\n\\nCryptocurrency theft and hacking incidents have become increasingly prevalent, with cybercriminals constantly devising new ways to compromise online wallets and exchanges. For those who understand the gravity of this situation, an offline solution like VaultGuard emerges as a robust fortress of protection.\\n\\n**The Cash Equivalent example**\\n\\nTo put things in perspective, think of your digital assets as a wallet filled with thousands of dollars. Just as you wouldn’t flaunt your cash on the street, carrying your crypto holdings on an online wallet is akin to walking around with a significant sum of money in your pocket. The risk is real, and the consequences of a security breach can be financially devastating.\\n\\nThis is where VaultGuard, an offline hardware security solution, comes into play. VaultGuard is your digital vault, ensuring that your cryptocurrencies are stored in the most secure and impenetrable manner. But what exactly sets it apart, and why is offline storage the key to protecting your digital wealth?\\n\\n**The VaultGuard Advantage**\\n\\n**Air-Gapped Security:** One of the most significant advantages of VaultGuard is its air-gapped nature. Unlike online wallets and exchanges that are constantly connected to the internet, VaultGuard operates in isolation. This means assets are not exposed to online threats. It’s like keeping your wealth locked in an impervious safe, away from prying eyes.\\n\\n**Protection from Hacks:** Cyberattacks on online platforms can lead to massive losses for crypto holders. VaultGuard minimizes the risk of such incidents, as it cannot be hacked remotely. Your assets are stored offline, making it virtually impossible for hackers to gain access to your digital treasure trove.\\n\\n**Physical Security:** Just like you wouldn’t entrust your life savings to a flimsy wallet, you shouldn’t leave your digital wealth vulnerable. VaultGuard provides a tangible, robust solution that you can physically secure in a safe or other secure location. It’s a level of control that online solutions simply can’t offer.\\n\\n**Ownership and Control:** When you use online wallets or exchanges, you’re essentially entrusting your assets to third parties. With VaultGuard, you maintain control over your crypto holdings, and your security is in your hands.\\n\\n**Peace of Mind:** Knowing that your cryptocurrencies are stored in an offline vault-like environment provides peace of mind. You can rest easy, knowing that your digital assets are protected from the uncertainties of the online world.\\n\\nIn an era where digital wealth is as valuable as physical assets, securing your cryptocurrencies is not a choice — it’s a necessity. VaultGuard offers a level of protection that is second to none, ensuring that your investments remain out of reach for potential threats. Think of it as your personal digital fortress, guarding your crypto wealth with unwavering strength. So, don’t leave your digital fortune exposed — lock it away in the impenetrable vault of VaultGuard, and rest easy in the knowledge that your wealth is truly secure.\\n\\nStay safe with vaultguard.  \\n[Vaultguard.io](http://vaultguard.io/)', 'comments': []}, {'title': 'Growth DeFi AMA 🌱🌳', 'subreddit': 'Apeswap', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Apeswap/comments/p9ew6u/growth_defi_ama/', 'selftext': \"Welcome to another Reddit AMA Apes!

Look- I want you to make shitloads of money. The more you make the more this game develops and evolves. Great. Finding the appropriate price point is key to maximizing profits. Would you rather have 10 people buy an $18 Skin or 100 people buy a $2 skin? Countless people have mentioned they would drop $20 if they felt like they were getting more value than just a single atomic shop item. I don’t know the exact numbers but I bet you have the resources to find out!\\n\\n6) Add a subscription fee or a seasonal pass that does something like gets me all the atomic shop items for that month. Make sure it’s a good deal (Akin to 50% off atomic shop retail). That way it’s optional, doesn’t provide in game benefits above free to play and we can support you. This subreddit has 200,000 members. If half of that chose to subscribe for even just $10 a month (a steal for atomic shop items) that is a cool million in bonus capital to throw around each month.\\n\\nI know it can feel like we are shitting on you- but we want you to succeed. We want to give you dollars so you keep making and improving games we love- but you need to adapt to the online game world like ESO did.\\n\\nEdit 3: Bethesda posted an Inside the Vault article that follows similar guidelines to what I recommended. Sincerely, good on them for doing this- we appreciate the communication. \\n\\nThat being said- I stand by what I said earlier. Communication needs to be faster on the more direct channels. I totally understand if you cannot just crank out an Inside the Vault in 20 minutes (although I bet most of it is templated and absolutely could be), but use Twitter, Instagram, Facebook (you can even sync them all so you only have to make 1 post to go to all 3!) or pick one area we can reliably go for live updates (should it be inside the vault, fallout 76 website header, etc).\\n\\nEdit 2: Lots of traffic on this post! Thanks for the great feedback and discussion. \\n\\nFor context I have been playing Bethesda games since Morrowind. My occupation has been that of a General Manager in the hospitality industry for a number of companies, overseeing as much as 120 employees and a $50 million asset, as well as a small business owner. Not the same industry (I have friends who work in tech, developers, etc) but honestly, when it gets down to it many of the fundamentals (Not specifics) regarding budgets, revenue, profit maximization, funding, investors, consumer and employee satisfaction are largely the same. It’s all just about moving different products down a similar line, generating revenue to maximize profits while keeping your employees and consumers happy.\\n\\nI did want to address one point in particular that a lot of folks have taken umbrage with- calling for firing the PR person.\\n\\nI know it’s harsh to call for someone’s termination. I have had to fire probably around 150 people at this point in my life. Firing people really sucks, cause most people are great. And their family is great. But if they are not doing their job consistently then they need to lose their job. If your coder does their work poorly for a year, you fire them. If your customer service rep is mean to customers for a year, you fire them. In many industries PR folks do not work 9-5. Their job is communication with the masses. They adjust their work schedules accordingly. If it’s salary- great. Some weeks you may only have to put in 30 hours. Some will be 70. Most of the folks I have ever known in PR fields are workaholics and like to be on the go constantly. But even all of that is largely irrelevant if you plan accordingly.\\n\\nLet’s take the example of patch 11. You are dropping a new patch that has not been publicly tested. You should know by now it may go wrong as many in the past have. So when it does- communicate. You don’t have to have cold, blanket PR statements. You can have genuine ones with genuine information that you have planned for. Ask yourself the question “How do I communicate with the community at large if this goes bad? How can I reduce the fallout? How can I leave the community feeling good after a negative initial experience?” Remember folks, this is their job. \\n\\nI know that many of you are citing the No Mans Sky interview, but I disagree with that philosophy in general. Sure, maybe it worked for him in his scenario. It’s pretty hard to say if he made the best decision, as the number of people who will not ever play it is sort of a dark statistic. Even then, having your game receive horrible PR on launch is of different scope than what is happening here. We are talking about consistent gameplay patches that have done this for a year. I feel like a year is a generous amount of time to wait before you start calling people out. If the game is broke- tell me you know. When you have an ETA on the game fix tell me (under promise and over deliver on the timeframe). \\n\\nRegarding fans getting more upset about an update: sure that might happen if you are not genuine. But I stand by my assertion, and have watched it happen first hand for many years in my own industry, if you give clear, concise communication with relevant, genuine information it has a much, much better impact than simply remaining silent.\\n\\nEdit 1: Words and letters.', 'comments': ['> 5) Lower the cost of your atomic shop items.

Based on the observations so far, I have found several indicators that suggest \"asset-vault.online\" could be a scam website: 1. The website promises high returns on investments, which could be indicative of a high-yield investment program (HYIP) scam. 2. The WHOIS information shows a recent domain registration and the use of a privacy protection service to hide the registrant's identity, which can be common among scam websites. 3. The website's content targets human psychological weaknesses by promising wealth and investment opportunities without substantial proof or backing. 4. The physical address format and the year mentioned in the copyright notice are unusual and may not be credible. 5. There is a lack of online discussion or reports found through Reddit and Twitter, which could mean the site is not widely recognized or has not been reported yet. I now know the final answer.
