In a way that trading hasn't pissed me off in a long time. I knew that somebody on the other end was cheating everyone who was consistant with their plan was winning, but because the more emotional traders were losing, they had to game the market to their benifit. This is something that really hasn't happened to me too much untill the covid crash, then the GameStop squeeze #1. Something in the market has Fundimentals changed. \\n\\nIt showed me that the cheaters had gotten drunk off their positions. And they were immune to the thought of loss. They had the Fed by the balls, they have retail by the balls. When the time came when they were about to loose, they double down like a TRUE degenerate. They forgot that they already lost the trade. They failed to realize it. They got stuck. Instead, they cheated the system to make it seem like they won. But as true OG traders know, the illusion of losing is only that. An illusion. It's something you learn to block out as a trader. \\n\\nThe price of the stock is going down. But I already know I won. As a trader, I saw what they did. They lost. And they didn't realise it, and they have been trying to dupe us since. We are talking about money in the order of billions.

The guy drives around in a Mclaren, bottle service at the club, expensive clothes and shoes…. The whole deal. This guy and his group of traders told my cousin that they had enough room for him to open an account with $50k or so and they would trade it for him. My cousin calls me everyday telling me how much he is up and there hasn’t been a day he’s down. His account has grown maybe 25-40% since he opened it just a few months ago. I have been skeptical of this because to me it sounds like a scam. Who is able to get 25-40% returns, almost never experience a loss in a client’s account, etc? But he assures me that it is legit. Doesn’t provide much reasoning why, but he says it’s legit. He mentioned that there’s this guy named Ted and the company is Traders Domain. It took me 15-20 minutes of googling around and reading different articles to immediately start questioning the legitimacy of this forex brokerage firm even further as there are many claims that it is a scam. I come to find out the guy’s full name is Ted Safranko, and found a decent amount of positive and negative information on him. \\n\\nAs a newbie to this, and as my family member is trying to get me to join this firm and leave assets with Ted, I wanted to ask if anybody has heard of Traders Domain, Ted Safranko, or anything else that could help me determine if this is legit?
