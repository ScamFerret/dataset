I now know the final answer based on the analysis of the website content and the limited information from external sources. While I cannot definitively confirm the website as a scam without more concrete evidence, the website does exhibit several characteristics consistent with scam websites. Based on the observed information and the absence of conclusive evidence from external sources, it is reasonable to suspect that https://trustdigitglobalinvestment.com/ could potentially be a scam website.

The lack of presence on social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter is also concerning for a company that claims over 10 years of experience."
