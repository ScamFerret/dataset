However, the fact that the domain was registered recently (about six months ago from the time of the analysis) could be a potential red flag, as many fraudulent sites are not longstanding. Additionally, the domain is registered until 2024, which is not too far in the future, but this does not necessarily indicate fraud on its own. The fact that the domain uses privacy protection services is not inherently suspicious, as many legitimate businesses also use such services to protect their privacy. Considering the findings so far: the unusually high discounts, lack of specific contact information, ambiguous privacy policy, and recent domain registration, there are several indicators that https://www.discountsshoe.com/ could potentially be a fraudulent site. While not all of these points are conclusive on their own, collectively they suggest that caution is warranted. I now know the final answer.
