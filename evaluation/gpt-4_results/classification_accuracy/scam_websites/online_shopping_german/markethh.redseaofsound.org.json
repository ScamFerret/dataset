Additionally, the use of generic product descriptions and the lack of brand names for some items (e.g., \"Unbranded coin purse\") raise suspicions. The presence of multiple language options and various currencies suggests an attempt to appeal to a broad audience, which is common for scam sites looking to target as many victims as possible. The site also lists very low prices with high discounts, such as $27.88 from a \"normal price\" of $82, which could be an unusually low price and a tactic to lure in customers.
