There's also mention of free shipping for more than 100,000 parts. The text seems to target human psychological weaknesses by emphasizing discounts and free shipping. However, further analysis is needed to make a definitive conclusion. The website content alone is not enough to label it a scam.

However, this doesn't contribute to confirming or denying the legitimacy of the site. Based on the observations from the website content, lack of social media presence, and the claim of unusually low prices with free shipping, I am leaning towards the possibility that this could be a scam website. The absence of feedback on social media platforms could either mean the site is new or not widely known, both of which are common with scam sites. The lack of any concrete evidence of scam activity, however, means I do not have definitive proof. I now know the final answer. {",
