I have requested the mods keep this post a sticky until June 3, which is when most retailers end their Memorial Day sales. Keep in mind that not all US retailers will ship internationally and any savings you get can be wiped out from import duty, tariffs and taxes from your home country.\\n\\n**Keep in mind inflation has caused many items to have 10-30% price increases as warned by** [**u/explorerzam**](https://www.reddit.com/u/explorerzam/)**\\'s** [**post from**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampingGear/comments/qdnlzi/psa_from_an_outdoor_retailer/) **2021**. Prices will continue to go up as inflation gets out of control, so this could be a better time to buy camping gear than waiting till later in the year.\\n\\nNew for 2022/2023 I am streamlining the deals thread so we can add additional retailers and cut down on clutter. I will list the retailer, example deals and if the retailer participates in cashback sites. Return policy, company background, credit card offers, free shipping etc will no longer be listed as that can be looked up on the retailer\\'s website. This will make the threads appear on less posts and hopefully will flow a bit better. Thanks to several of you who offered this suggestion. I am also adding direct vendor sales as sales start (Marmot, Outdoor Research, Sierra Designs, Outdoor Vitals etc).\\n\\nThis thread focuses on retailers and e-commerce sites in the United States who sell multiple brands, are reputable businesses (ie not scam sites) and they ship and sell to anywhere in the US. I encourage you to check with the vendors directly and to use cashback sites like [Activejunky.com](https://activejunky.com/) and [Topcashback.com](https://topcashback.com/) to save as much money as possible in addition to these links.\\n\\nCheckout [Cashbackholic.com](https://cashbackholic.com/) and [cashbackmonitor.com](https://cashbackmonitor.com/) to see what cashback sites are offering the highest cashback for whatever site you wish to shop at. Typically [activejunky.com](https://activejunky.com/) is the highest paying cashback site, but sometimes Maxrebates.com , [topcashback.com](https://topcashback.com/) and [rakuten.com](https://rakuten.com/) can be higher.\\n\\nThank you to everyone who contributed to this sales thread for last year. I hope to have helped save fellow Redditors as much money as possible to help get more people into camping and the Backcountry.

I have requested the mods keep this post a sticky until September 9, which is when most retailers end their Labor Day sales. Keep in mind that not all US retailers will ship internationally and any savings you get can be wiped out from import duty, tariffs and taxes from your home country.\\n\\n**Keep in mind inflation has caused many items to have 10-30% price increases as warned by** [**u/explorerzam**](https://www.reddit.com/u/explorerzam/)**\\'s** [**post from** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampingGear/comments/qdnlzi/psa_from_an_outdoor_retailer/)**2021**. Prices will continue to go up as inflation gets out of control, so this could be a better time to buy camping gear than waiting till later in the year.\\n\\nNew for 2023 I am streamlining the deals thread so we can add additional retailers and cut down on clutter. I will list the retailer, example deals and if the retailer participates in cashback or not and credit card cashback offers. Return policy, company background, free shipping etc will no longer be listed as that can be looked up on the retailer\\'s website. This will make the threads appear on less posts and hopefully will flow a bit better. Thanks to several of you who offered this suggestion. I am also adding direct vendor sales as sales start (Marmot, Outdoor Research, Sierra Designs, Outdoor Vitals etc).\\n\\nThis thread focuses on retailers and e-commerce sites in the United States who sell multiple brands, are reputable businesses (ie not scam sites) and they ship and sell to anywhere in the US. I encourage you to check with the vendors directly and to use cashback sites like [Activejunky.com](https://activejunky.com/) and [Topcashback.com](https://topcashback.com/) to save as much money as possible in addition to these links.\\n\\nCheckout [Cashbackholic.com](https://cashbackholic.com/) and [cashbackmonitor.com](https://cashbackmonitor.com/) to see what cashback sites are offering the highest cashback for whatever site you wish to shop at. Typically [activejunky.com](https://activejunky.com/) is the highest paying cashback site, but sometimes [Maxrebates.com](https://maxrebates.com/) , [topcashback.com](https://topcashback.com/) and [rakuten.com](https://rakuten.com/) can be higher.\\n\\nThank you to everyone who contributed to this sales thread for last year.

I have requested the mods keep this post a sticky until June 4, which is when most retailers end their Memorial Day sales. Keep in mind that not all US retailers will ship internationally and any savings you get can be wiped out from import duty, tariffs and taxes from your home country.\\n\\n**Keep in mind inflation has caused many items to have 10-30% price increases as warned by** [**u/explorerzam**](https://www.reddit.com/u/explorerzam/)**\\'s** [**post from last year**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampingGear/comments/qdnlzi/psa_from_an_outdoor_retailer/). Prices will continue to go up as inflation gets out of control, so this could be a better time to buy camping gear than waiting till later in the year.\\n\\nNew for 2022 I am streamlining the deals thread so we can add additional retailers and cut down on clutter. I will list the retailer, example deals and if the retailer participates in cashback or not and credit card cashback offers. Return policy, company background, free shipping etc will no longer be listed as that can be looked up on the retailer\\'s website. This will make the threads appear on less posts and hopefully will flow a bit better. Thanks to several of you who offered this suggestion. I am also adding direct vendor sales as sales start (Marmot, Outdoor Research, Sierra Designs, Outdoor Vitals etc).\\n\\nThis thread focuses on retailers and e-commerce sites in the United States who sell multiple brands, are reputable businesses (ie not scam sites) and they ship and sell to anywhere in the US. I encourage you to check with the vendors directly and to use cashback sites like [Activejunky.com](https://activejunky.com/) and [Topcashback.com](https://topcashback.com/) to save as much money as possible in addition to these links.\\n\\nCheckout [Cashbackholic.com](https://Cashbackholic.com) and [cashbackmonitor.com](https://cashbackmonitor.com/) to see what cashback sites are offering the highest cashback for whatever site you wish to shop at. Typically [activejunky.com](https://activejunky.com) is the highest paying cashback site, but sometimes Maxrebates.com , [topcashback.com](https://topcashback.com) and [rakuten.com](https://rakuten.com) can be higher.\\n\\nThank you to everyone who contributed to this sales thread for last year. I hope to have helped save fellow Redditors as much money as possible to help get more people into camping and the Backcountry.

        "thought": "The search results provide some insight into the typical characteristics of scam websites, such as overly good-to-be-true deals, lack of company reputation, and site security issues. One search result specifically mentions the domain \"marmot-outlet.com\" and assigns it a risk score of 40.8/100, which indicates potential risks associated with the website. Additionally, another result notes that the domain was only 67 days old at the time of the review, which could be a red flag considering the relatively recent domain registration. These observations point towards a need for caution.
