Given the red flags observed so far, this absence of social proof could be concerning. However, I need to make a decision based on the information I have gathered. Based on the evidence and observations from the actions taken, including unusually low prices, misleading copyright date, lack of clear contact details, use of a privacy service for domain registration, and absence of user discussions on social media platforms, I conclude that https://www.orderumbrella.com/ is likely a scam website.",

The copyright date was incorrectly listed as a future year indicating outdated or misleading information. The contact details were vague and the domain registration used a privacy service which can be a tactic to avoid easy tracing of the website's operators. Additionally there is a lack of social media presence and user feedback which could suggest a lack of legitimacy or an attempt to avoid detection."
