Click the link below to download the free ScamAdviser Browser Extension. Download Now Full review Company Rating We see that the owner of the website is using a service to hide his/her identity. This may be because the owner does not want to get spammed. However, it also makes it difficult to identify the real owner of the website. As a result, websites hiding their identity get a slightly lower score. Webshop Analysis According to Tranco this site has a low Tranco rank. This means that the number of visitors to this website is quite low. You can expect this from a small, starting or niche website. A popular website however should have a higher ranking. How to recognize a scam Technical Analysis The online store does not seem to have an SSL certificate. An SSL certificate makes the communication between your computer and the server of the online store secure. Now, if you type in your contact details or payment information, this is communicated across an open line, allowing others to access this information. Having an SSL certificate has become the norm for any website, especially online stores. We consider this a strong negative finding.
