This is not typical for an e-commerce site, which usually has more comprehensive DNS records including A, MX, and possibly TXT records for various purposes such as website hosting, email, and verification records. The lack of substantial DNS records is another red flag. I have now observed several potential scam indicators: unusually high discounts, a lack of user feedback on social media, and insufficient DNS records. However, I have not found conclusive evidence of other common scam characteristics such as targeting psychological weaknesses, non-existent company information, inappropriate contact details, ambiguous privacy policy, unconventional payment methods, or outdated information. Given the information available and the unusual aspects observed, I am leaning towards identifying the site as suspicious. However, I must recognize that the evidence is not fully conclusive, as legitimate new e-commerce sites can also have limited social media presence, and use free SSL certificates. I now know the final answer Based on the evidence gathered and the unusual characteristics observed, it appears that https://mahsooni.shop/ may be a scam website.",

There is also a complete lack of user feedback on social media platforms such as Reddit and Twitter which is suspicious for an e-commerce site. Additionally the DNS records are not typical for a legitimate e-commerce site and only contain an HINFO record with a placeholder response which is not standard for a site conducting business online. These factors combined raise enough suspicion to classify the website as potentially fraudulent."
