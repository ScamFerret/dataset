The lack of these records might be unusual and could potentially indicate a less established website. Given the information I have gathered so far, it might be time to conclude the analysis. With the information collected, including the unusually low prices, a low trust score on Scamadviser, recent domain creation, and lack of substantial DNS records, I have enough evidence to suggest that eaterysale.com could potentially be a scam website. Despite having a valid SSL certificate, the other indicators raise enough red flags to be cautious. I now know the final answer.
