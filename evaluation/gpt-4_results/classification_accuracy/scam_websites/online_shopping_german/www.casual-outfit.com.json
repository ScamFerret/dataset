This has been perplexing because of all the Matty clues in this songs lyrics.  But also, Swifties misidentified Taylor\\'s outfit in Jack\\'s instagram video of her recording The Black Dog as being in May, while she was still with Matty. She recorded it in late June. They had the wrong outfit.\\n\\nHere\\'s the evidence.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dhaiu3k1xawc1.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fe480462864f9143a464c97578d2a732094039d\\n\\nThe Black Dog (bar) is downtown Cork, where The 1975 played a show on June 13. (note her lyric says \"bar\")\\n\\nThe Black Dog (pub) in London (south side of the river) is not in one of the neighborhoods Joe is known to frequent (north London and west end neighborhoods).\\n\\nTaylor and Matty probably split sometime before June 2, as she was visibly shaken and crying at Soldier Field.\\n\\nTaylor\\'s outfit when recording The Black Dog in the studio video Jack posted is: white tee and black bike shorts with a white logo down the side, hair in ponytail. There are no pap pics of her in black bike shorts with a white logo.

There are a bunch of other Matty clues in this song - her rain-soaked body (Gillette - he was there), the smoking, The Starting Line song, and the younger woman because Matty pretty much exclusively dates much younger women). It all really leans towards this song being about Matty.\\n\\nThat\\'s it!

The entire album is called The Tortured Poet’s Department, and if you listen to the lyrics of that song carefully, you’ll understand why. *They’re* the tortured poets, according to Taylor. They’re the only ones who “get” each other. I read on TikTok that she got some pushback about the title because it is so long and wordy and clunky in your mouth. But she was adamant. Probably because it means something specific to Matty and her. The whole thing is a message to him.', \"Thank you for putting this together!\\xa0It makes so much more sense now...

Over time cloak designs have been changed to match fashion and available textiles. Cloaks generally fasten at the neck or over the shoulder, vary in length, from hip all the way down to the ankle, mid-calf being the normal length. They may have an attached hood and may cover and fasten down the front, in which case they have holes or slits for the hands to pass through.

We\\'ve been casual friends since college, but only began dating after she graduated. We get along really well. When I say princess syndrome, I don\\'t mean that she is spoiled or entitled, because she isn\\'t. Her clothes seem to take over her life.\\n\\nShe dresses like a sort of fairytale princess on a near daily basis, excluding at work. Long, frilly skirts, lacey blouses, things like that. It works for her because she is very pretty and can pull it off. At first I found it to be very endearing, but then I became aware of how much time she spends on her outfits.\\n\\nShe runs a blog that has a sizeable amount of followers, and she is constantly posting outfit pictures, links to clothing items, and what not. She spends a few hours a day on her blog, at least. Then she spends time sewing items for new outfits or for her etsy store.\\n\\nWhen we go out, we get a lot of stares at what she\\'s wearing. I\\'ve also caught people sneaking pictures of her on their cell phones. This attention makes me uncomfortable. I have asked her to tone it down a bit, but she took that to mean not wearing anything in her hair when we\\'re out together.\\n\\nI have told her several times that I love her just the way she is, but she seems to brush it off. I had hoped when she started her new job in the career of her choice that she would become more serious, but her new boss and co-workers encourage her. I worry that people won\\'t take her seriously, or miss how kind and intelligent she is. How can I talk to her about dressing more appropriately without hurting her feelings?\\n\\n**tl;dr**: Girlfriend dresses like a princess, how do I talk to her about it?\\n\\n***Relevant Comments:***\\n\\nCommenter: Sounds like you have to get over your insecurities. This is her hobby, her interest, and she\\'s getting positive reactions. You shouldn\\'t be trying to change her, especially when it was something that initially drew you to her.\\n\\n>**OOP:** I guess I\\'m having trouble seeing clothing as a hobby? I play video games as a hobby, but that doesn\\'t cause strangers to take pictures of me when I\\'m trying to shop at the supermarket.  \\n>  \\n>I get your point that it initially drew me to her, because it did. That\\'s fair. I guess I didn\\'t think that it would be such a constant thing in her life, especially after she graduated.\\n\\nCommenter: So, you love her just the way she is but you\\'re assuming she\\'ll take that to mean she should change how she is? That doesn\\'t make sense.\\n\\nThis IS how she is. She enjoys dressing up like this. Shit, she posts outfit photos online because she enjoys it so much. Other people encourage her because they DO like how she is.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t like the attention ask her sometime to just go out with you while she\\'s wearing a casual outfit, but keep in mind that she already loves what she\\'s normally wearing.\\n\\n>**OOP:** This is my problem! How do I ask her to dress more casually around me without her misinterpreting what I mean again AND also not hurting her feelings? I can think of ways to say one half of that, but it doesn\\'t work with the other half.\\n\\nCommenter: If you love her the way she is, why do you want her to change? Just curious.\\n\\n>**OOP:** She doesn\\'t need all the frilly stuff, she\\'d still look like a princess. And it\\'s one thing for an artsy college student to dress alternatively, but she\\'s a 23 year old woman now. I feel like her clothing masks how smart she is and makes her appear shallow.\\n\\n*Is it for attention?*\\n\\nI do think it\\'s an attention thing. She says she doesn\\'t care about what people think about her, but she spends so much time on her blog, replying to comments and such, I kind of doubt it. She also has told me that she loves being approached by little girls while she\\'s dressed up, which definitely makes me think it\\'s about attention.\\n\\nShe doesn\\'t dress inappropriately by those standards, she is well groomed and doesn\\'t show much skin. But is it appropriate to wear lacey dresses and flower crowns to the supermarket. Again, it attracts unnecessary attention.\\n\\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2edlrp/updates_me_24_m_with_my_gf_23_f_girlfriend_has/) **1: August 23, 2014 (11 days later)**\\n\\nI didn\\'t plan on updating, but things changed. I realized from my last post that I needed to be more supportive, but also communicate on how she could dress down on certain occasions so we could both be comfortable. Well, I never got a chance to talk to her about it.\\n\\nLast week she called and wanted to stop by my apartment after work. When she got there I offered to make dinner, but she said she couldn\\'t stay and we had to talk. I jokingly asked if she was breaking up with me, and she looked really guilty. You can see where this is going.\\n\\nWe talked about how we were in different places in life and had different goals for the future. Well, she talked, but I agreed. It was a pretty amicable break up, even though I felt blindsided. We agreed to stay friends. I\\'ve never been dumped before, and it\\'s fucking awful.\\n\\nI\\'m having trouble with the whole social media thing post break up. I want a way to keep in touch with her, but as soon as her relationship status changed all these \"alternative\" looking guys have been liking her posts and commenting on her pictures. I don\\'t think she\\'s seeing these guys, but it still hurts.\\n\\nMy friend wants to set me up on a date, but I don\\'t know if it\\'s a good idea.\\n\\n***Relevant Comments:***\\n\\nCommenter: Fickle is the head that wears the flowered lace crown. It was never going to work out, anyway. You had some laughs and some good times, enjoy that and move on.\\n\\n>**OOP:** I understood some of her reasoning. Mainly, I want to move out of the city once my lease is up, and I wanted her to move in with me. I was worried about long distance. She didn\\'t want to leave the city, though.  \\n>  \\n>She said something about me be controlling, too, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the case at all.\\n\\n*Block her:*\\n\\nWe agreed to stay friends, so I don\\'t want to block her.\\n\\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bvxvuj/update_me_24m_with_my_gf_23f_girlfriend_has/) **2: April 4, 2024 (9 years, 8 months later)**\\n\\nI was going through an old email and found this account again. I was surprised I could still log in, and even more by the amount of people who had reached out to me.\\n\\nIt\\'s a bit embarrassing to relive this break up from almost 10 years ago. In retrospect, it wasn\\'t meant to be and I think I was reeling more from getting dumped than the loss of the relationship.\\n\\nI am 33 now and married to a wonderful woman (31F) for 4 years. I learned my lesson about supporting my significant other\\'s hobbies. My wife loves running and baking. We have a daughter who is turning 3 this year. I want her to be free to express herself how she likes (as long as it is safe, of course!). I would do anything for them.\\n\\nI am still friends with my ex on social media. We don\\'t talk but will \"like\" each other\\'s posts. She is married to another woman now who also dresses differently. It\\'s not as frilly as she used to dress, but still unusual. Her pictures look like something out of Anne of Green Gables. She seems very happy on their farm together.\\n\\nTL;DR: Was dumb in my early 20s. Got over an old break up and now I am married and happily supporting my wife\\'s hobbies.\\n\\n***Relevant Comment:***\\n\\nCommenter: Can we expect an update in 10 years when your daughter has become a teenager and developed princess syndrome?\\n\\nAlso congratulations on your life.\\n\\n>**OOP:** Well, she does love pink and purple!\\xa0', 'comments': ['This almost reminds me of that post/update of the guy who was dating a woman who dressed like Miss Frizzle and he had a major problem with it. Much like this story here, I’m not surprised they broke up.', 'Seeing that shes married to a woman now is maybe the least shocking thing to ever happen to me', \"I'm 30 and I'm trying to find clothes that are frilly and pretty and princessy but still wearable for every day. Like I love fancy dresses but hate full length. But short fancy dresses look too junior high prom. I wish i could see the ex's outfits to see if it's what I'm looking for lol\\n\\n\\nEdit: thanks for all the suggestions, everyone!\", '10 years ago i was also in the Japanese lolita alt fashion scene and there were tonnnns of stories like this where boyfriends were constantly “why can’t you dress normal girly and not princessy” because they literally couldn’t fathom hyperfemme fashion that _wasn’t_ also designed to appeal to men who were into feminine/“traditional” girls. Lolita fashion takes a fighter jet across that line and tons of guys hated it, to the point that in Japan specifically, girls would love the style because it was super fulfilling for them but a turnoff for men.\\n\\nAlso to no one’s surprise, tons of girls in the style turned out to be queer, because female-dominated alt fashion hobbies where the focus was on meticulous expression for other girls’ attentions tended to attract girls who liked other girls. Lemme tell you how funny it was that these gals were also rubbing shoulders with a lot of American Christian purity/tradwife types who were into “modest dress” (in terms of not showing skin) but wanted to peacock around and show the other Sunday prayer ladies what was up … lotta them also turned out gay too lol', 'When I read the words \"Princess Syndrome\" I assumed this post was gonna be about someone who is selfish, entitled, and expects the world to revolve around them. And in a way, it was.']}]"
