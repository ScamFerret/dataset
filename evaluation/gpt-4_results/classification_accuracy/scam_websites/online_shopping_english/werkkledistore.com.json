The registrant information is protected by a privacy service, which is not uncommon but can sometimes be used by fraudulent sites to hide their true identity. The phone number listed is a generic number that could be used for privacy services. The recent creation date and the use of a privacy service, combined with the red flags raised by the website content and the search results, are concerning.
