There is a mention of a \"Warranty\" which is vague and the copyright year is 2024, which is not possible as my knowledge cutoff is in 2023, indicating outdated or incorrect information.

The website was only 20 days old at the time of the report, and it was noted that there was no customer service contact number provided. Products on the site were reported as dubious, suggesting the use of substandard materials. This aligns with several characteristics of scam websites. Based on the search result indicating direct complaints about zacharylishop.com being a counterfeit store and the observations made from the WHOIS information, website content, and hyperlinks, I can conclude that this website is likely a scam.
