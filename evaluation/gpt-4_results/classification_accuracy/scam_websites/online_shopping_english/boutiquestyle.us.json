However, the common names listed in the certificates are peculiar. One of the common names includes 'www.myrhythmic.us.imtanveer.com', which seems unrelated to the domain in question and could potentially be a sign of a misconfiguration or something more dubious, like an attempt to appear legitimate by associating with other domains. At this point, considering the factors I’ve examined: - The website content does not match what one would expect from a legitimate e-commerce site. - The domain was recently created, which can be a red flag for new scam websites. - There is no specific online reputation or user reports to indicate it as a scam, but also no evidence confirming its legitimacy. - The SSL certificate includes a common name that seems unrelated to the boutique website, raising concerns about the website's authenticity. Although I do not have concrete proof of a scam, the observations so far suggest that the website might not be trustworthy. With the information I have, I am inclined to err on the side of caution and consider it potentially fraudulent. I now know the final answer.
