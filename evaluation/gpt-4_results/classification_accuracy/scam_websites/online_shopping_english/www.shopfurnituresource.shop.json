The presence of only internal links is not uncommon for e-commerce websites, but it does not help in determining the legitimacy of the site. Given the information I have gathered, the unusually low prices, the lack of detailed DNS information, and the unsuccessful WHOIS retrieval, I need to make a decision based on these observations. Since I have not found conclusive evidence of a scam, but there are several red flags, I will make a cautious determination. I now know the final answer. The URL https://www.shopfurnituresource.shop/ exhibits some characteristics of a scam website, such as unusually low prices and a lack of detailed DNS information. However, the absence of customer reviews or discussion about the website being a scam, the presence of a valid SSL certificate, and the lack of external hyperlinks make the determination less certain. Based on the available information and the observed red flags, I would err on the side of caution and suggest that the website could potentially be a scam, but without more concrete evidence, this determination is made with a degree of uncertainty.",
