I should now consider the information I have gathered to determine if I can conclude whether the website is a scam. I have observed unusually low prices and claims of high discounts, as well as a suspicious copyright date in the future. The lack of contact information hyperlinks and the inability to retrieve WHOIS data raise additional red flags. Although the SSL certificate is valid, this does not ensure legitimacy. The lack of social media discussion could simply mean the site is not well-known, but given the other red flags, it seems more likely that it might be a scam.
