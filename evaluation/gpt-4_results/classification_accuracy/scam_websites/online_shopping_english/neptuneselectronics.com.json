P.S. One of the scam bros said they love their job, meaning they love lying and stealing from hard-working people. I don\\'t know maybe they\\'ve been abused by their own parents since I can\\'t comprehend how one can be proud of abusing weaker.\\n\\nAnyway, maybe for someone, a sum of 400 600 Euros is not much but some people work very hard for their money ....\\n\\nBut yeah long story short (again) as soon as they get the money they keep promising to have the item sent by the end of the week, and this continues for a while. Then they will provide you with a tracking code that will never have any use since the status will always be \"parcel hasn\\'t been handed in by the sender\". They keep doing this until they try to ask for more money via link and the item will arrive yaddi yaddi yadda. In the end, people of course get frustrated and ask for a refund, and this continues until you give up. It\\'s always \"almost there\" and usually by the end of the week, you are supposed to receive your refund.\\n\\nI filed plenty of complaints to European Customer Protection and some local authorities, but that helps when you are dealing with actual companies, not rats that are hiding behind Frontapp. Some companies said they could provide help but their cost is above what was lost so it doesn\\'t make much sense, my mom doesn\\'t care anymore since this has been going on for half a year now and she completely gave up.

        "thought": "The Reddit post presents a compelling case of an individual's mother who was scammed by the website in question. The post details how the addresses listed on the website are inaccurate and belong to unrelated businesses, and that customer support is non-responsive. Additionally, it mentions a pattern of deceitful behavior, such as promising shipping that never occurs and providing useless tracking codes. The poster also expresses frustration with the difficulty of taking action against such scammers. This aligns with the scam characteristics outlined, notably the information on non-existent companies and targeting psychological weaknesses through continuous promises. The Reddit post provides strong evidence that neptuneselectronics.com is operating as a scam. I now know the final answer. Based on the evidence and observations, it is highly likely that the website https://neptuneselectronics.com/ is a scam.",
