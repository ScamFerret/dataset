Read more Add to wishlist Compare The Plamer navel orange is a type of sweet orange that is seedless and has a rich, juicy flavour that is delicious for eating out of hand. The fruit is large and has a deep orange colour. It peels easily and the tender flesh provides a rich and pleasant flavour. The navel is recognised as the primary eating orange throughout the world. A Grade Fresh Orange The ‘Midknight’ Valencia orange is a South African variety of the standard Valencia orange. There are both positive and negative differences between ‘Midknight’ Valencia, and standard Valencia oranges and their respective trees. ‘Midknight’ trees are slower growing, and more susceptible to copper deficiency and frost than standard Valencia trees, but grow larger, juicier fruit with virtually no seeds; the Valencia orange is easier to peel and produces larger yields. Other characteristics of the ‘Midknight’ Valencia orange include its somewhat oblong shape, good juicing quality, earlier ripening than other Valencias, and its large, broad leaves. Witkrans Oranges The fruit shape is usually round to oval, with a smooth peel and a closed navel end. The fruit is juicy with good internal quality and soft fibre.The Witkrans Late navel was chosen exclusively for its late ripening time, good fruit size, good internal fruit quality, high fruit production, firm fruit and smooth peel.

        "thought": "There are some potential red flags in the text extracted from the website. Claims such as \"100% Money Back 30 Days Return Policy\" and \"Free Shipping On All local Orders\" could be considered unusually good offers, which is characteristic of scam websites. Additionally, the presence of a wide range of products such as oranges, peas, beans, garlic, canary seed, watermelon, and avocado is somewhat unusual for a single wholesale website and could indicate handling different products like a common e-commerce website. The use of a mobile messaging service like WhatsApp for customer service is unconventional for professional business communication. Moreover, the copyright year is listed as 2024, which has not yet occurred, indicating potentially outdated or incorrect information. To further investigate, I'll check the WHOIS information to see if the company information is available.",
