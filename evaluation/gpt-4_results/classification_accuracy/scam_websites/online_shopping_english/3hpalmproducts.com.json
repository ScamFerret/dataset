What do the WHOIS details tell us? How do I get my money back from 3hpalmproducts.com? Creating fake websites is easier than making real ones. Bad actors often copy everything from a genuine website that someone spent a lot of time building. They then just change the name to create a new, made-up website. 3hpalmproducts.com is one of these deceptive websites. The people behind it have several such sites, all stolen from real online stores. Their goal is to trick people into paying for things that they never actually plan to deliver.

Get in touch with the company or bank that gave you the credit or debit card. Tell them about the unauthorized charge and request them to cancel the transaction and refund your money. Did you use a gift card for payment? Reach out to the company that issued the gift card. Inform them that the card was used in a scam, and request a refund. Make sure to retain both the gift card and its receipt. Did you use a company like Western Union or MoneyGram to send money via a wire transfer? Get in touch with the company you used for the wire transfer. Let them know it was a scam, and request them to undo the transfer and return your money.

If you connected the app to your credit card or debit card, inform your credit card company or bank about the fraud and ask them to cancel the charge. Did you use cryptocurrency to make a payment? When you use cryptocurrency to pay, it’s usually not possible to reverse the payment. If you want your money back, the person you paid needs to send it back to you. However, you can still try reaching out to the company you used to send the money. Let them know it was a fraudulent transaction and ask if they can undo it for you.
