While the presence of an SSL certificate is a good sign, it is not enough to establish the legitimacy of a website.

This could be seen as another red flag since scam websites often have a short lifespan and may not build up a significant online presence before being exposed or shut down. With the information gathered so far, there are several red flags: unusually low prices and discounts, a future copyright date indicating outdated or incorrect information, no accessible WHOIS data, no clear contact information or privacy policy visible from the extracted hyperlinks, and a lack of social media presence or user discussions which might indicate a new or obscure website. Based on these observations and the lack of credible, verifiable information about the website, I am inclined to conclude that this website is suspicious and could potentially be a scam. I now know the final answer. Based on the analysis, the URL https://www.shopidcus.shop/ is likely a scam website.",
