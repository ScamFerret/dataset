The absence of a certificate could indicate that the site is not secure, which is often the case with scam websites. However, it is not definitive proof on its own. Since there is no SSL certificate, and combined with the recent registration date of the domain, the lack of any substantial online presence or discussion, and the fact that the website content is inaccessible, I am leaning towards the conclusion that this URL may be part of a scam website. However, I do not have direct evidence of scam characteristics from the website content itself due to the 404 error. It's important to consider that while the evidence suggests a likelihood of a scam, without direct observation of scam characteristics from the website content, the conclusion would be based on indirect indicators. I now know the final answer based on the evidence gathered from the WHOIS information, DNS records, lack of SSL certificate, and the absence of any social media discussions or reports. Based on the indirect evidence gathered, it is likely that the URL https://fortu.priorery.cfd/ is part of a scam website, although direct scam characteristics from the website content could not be confirmed due to the 404 error.",
