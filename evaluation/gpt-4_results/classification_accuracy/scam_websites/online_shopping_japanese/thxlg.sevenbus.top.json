The website has a 404 error despite being accessible, the WHOIS data shows a recently registered domain with privacy redactions, there is no social media presence, and there is no SSL certificate. These factors align with several scam website characteristics. I now know the final answer. The URL https://thxlg.sevenbus.top/ is a scam website.",

These factors combined strongly suggest that the website is a scam."
