Given the inability to access the website, the privacy-protected WHOIS information, the recent creation date of the domain, and now the DNS query result, I am inclined to suspect that the site may have been a fraudulent one. However, due to the limitations in accessing more direct evidence such as site content or public feedback, my conclusion will be based on these observations. I now know the final answer Given the inaccessible status of the website, privacy-protected WHOIS information, recent creation date, and the NXDOMAIN status of the DNS records, the URL https://ijwq.wedscale.top/ seems highly suspicious and could be a fraudulent site based on the available evidence.",
