Typically, a legitimate shopping website would have multiple hyperlinks to product pages, terms and conditions, privacy policies, contact information, and more. This lack of hyperlinks adds to the growing suspicion that the site may not be legitimate. Given the combination of all observations: - The website returned a status code of 200 but displayed a 404 error when attempting to access the content. - The WHOIS information could not be retrieved. - The website has a valid SSL certificate, but that alone does not guarantee legitimacy. - There is no public discourse or sentiment about the site on Reddit or Twitter. - The DNS record shows an HINFO record with \"RFC8482,\" which could indicate an attempt to hide server details. - There are no hyperlinks on the webpage, which is not typical for a legitimate e-commerce site. These points, when considered together, suggest that the website may be a scam. However, I have not observed direct evidence of unusually low prices, claims of free goods, claims of impossible amounts of money, or targeting human psychological weaknesses, which would be more conclusive. I now know the final answer. Based on the observations and the known characteristics of scam websites, it is likely that https://tijoqh.awesomecost.shop/ is a scam website.",
