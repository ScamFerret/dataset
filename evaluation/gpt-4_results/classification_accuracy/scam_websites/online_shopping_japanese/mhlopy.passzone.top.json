This can be a tactic used by scam websites to minimize their footprint and avoid easy tracking. At this point, based on the observations made so far, it appears that there are several indicators that suggest the website could be a scam: - The site returned a 200 status code but showed a 404 Not Found error, indicating potential deception or content hiding. - The domain registration information is recent and contains redacted information, which is common in scam operations to avoid detection. - There is a lack of public information or discussion about the website, which could indicate it's not well-known or new, possibly set up recently for scamming purposes. - There is no SSL certificate information available, which is a critical security feature for legitimate e-commerce sites. - The site does not contain any hyperlinks, which is unusual for an e-commerce site and could mean it's avoiding detection. I now know the final answer. The URL https://mhlopy.passzone.top/ is likely a scam website.",
