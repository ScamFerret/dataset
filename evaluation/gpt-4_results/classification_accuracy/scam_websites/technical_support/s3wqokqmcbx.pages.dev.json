The extracted text from the site contains scare tactics typically associated with scam websites, such as warnings about infections and urging the user to contact support immediately. The lack of hyperlinks on the page and the use of a 'null' phone number are also suspicious. Although the WHOIS information is redacted and there is no social media chatter to provide further context, the characteristics observed from the website content itself are indicative of a scam. I now know the final answer. Based on the characteristics listed and the observations made, the URL https://s3wqokqmcbx.pages.dev/smart89/ appears to be a scam website.",

These observations align with the characteristics of scam websites as outlined."
