I've made it for every family gather with the in-laws since and it's a real winner. Cannot recommend cinnamon babka enough!\\n\\nEdit: Wow, what a response! Due to popular demand I will be adding my recipe to this very comment in a future edit tomorrow morning, as I do not want to wake up my flatmates by going looking in the kitchen for the recipe right now. Thank you for your patience, and for taking an interest in the healing powers of the cinnamon babka.\\n\\nFinally found the scrap bit of paper I wrote the recipe on. I've written it out properly for y'all here. \\n\\nCinnamon Babka Recipe:\\n-------------------------\\n\\nRecipe yield: 2 roughly forearm length loafs of cinnamon babka \\n\\nDough Ingredients:\\n550g flour\\n75g brown sugar\\nbetween 10g and 15g yeast (you do you)\\n85g butter\\n3 or 4 eggs\\na bit of salt\\nsome food oil\\n\\nFilling Ingredients:\\n150g brown sugar\\n150g butter\\n2 table spoons cinnamon\\n\\nTopping Ingredients:\\nAbout 100g brown sugar\\n\\nEquipment needed:\\n2 Bread forms (or a jerry-rigged equivalent if you wanna get creative)\\n2 large bowls for baking\\nRolling pin\\nSomething to whisk with\\nA frying pan\\n(optional) machine to knead the dough for you (though I just use my hands, so that is fully doable if you don't have a machine)\\n\\nTo make the dough, start by mixing the flour, brown sugar, yeast and a pinch or two of salt in a big bowl. Once it's mixed, add the butter at room temperature or a little bit warmer, along with 160ml of warm (but not too warm) water and 3 to 4 eggs depending on the size of the eggs. Knead the dough for a good while. The dough should be smooth but sticky. \\n\\nLightly brush a new bowl with some food oil to avoid the dough from drying out, and move the dough over. Put a clean towel or some plastic wrap over the top and let the dough rest for between 1½ hours to 2 hours in room temperature. You can also let it rest in the fridge overnight. The dough should roughly double in size. (If you choose to leave it in the fridge overnight, you might need to let it sit in room temperature for 30 minutes to an hour before continuing to work with it.)\\n\\nTo make the cinnamon filling, whisk together the sugar, room temperature (or a bit warmer) butter, and ground cinnamon together until it reaches a smooth, spreadable consistency. \\n\\nNow the fun part! Split the dough in two. Cover a clean kitchen surface with flour to avoid the dough sticking. Take one of the halves and use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a roughly 3:4 ratio rectangle. The long side of the dough should be about as long as your forearm, or in that ballpark at least. Spread the cinnamon filling over the entire surface of the dough evenly. Roll the dough from the long side into a long sausage. Cut the sausage in two lengthwise so you have two long strands. Lay one of the strands over the other forming a plus sign. Braiding one half at a time, tightly twist the two strands around eachother and tuck the thinner ends into or under the loaf. Put baking paper into a bread form and move the braided dough into the bread form. Repeat the process with the second half of the dough. \\n\\nLet the dough rise in the bread forms for 30 minutes before baking them in the oven at 175°C for 35-40 minutes.\\n\\nWhile the babka is in the oven, prepare the sugar topping. Dump 100g brown sugar and about 120ml water into a frying pan and put it on medium-high heat. Stir to avoid burning for about 10-15 minutes. Once it seems that enough of the water has evaporated and you're left with a smooth brown sludge, take it off the heat. Once you take the babkas out of the oven, lightly cover the top of the babka with this sugary caramely topping, and really let it seep into the dough. \\n\\nAnd there you have it! Your very own babka.
