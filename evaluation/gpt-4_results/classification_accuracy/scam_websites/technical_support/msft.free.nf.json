This isn\\'t a ss of the verbal agreement between me  him and fatality but it is a screenshot of me and his agreement, just wanted to throw it out there since his only real defense is that \"he only has one screenshot\". A screenshot that provides more than enough evidence of foulplay at that... http://i.imgur.com/LIdz4vq.png it also shows up top where he claims to be a CSGOJackpot mod**\\n\\n\\n**Edit: I am 100% certain this is the fatal I am referring to - http://steamcommunity.com/id/FATALITY420 and this is 100% the Mach!ne I am referring to - http://steamcommunity.com/id/mach1ne1h... Fatality conveniently moves all his skins to a different account after I finally post the link to his lmao**\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s my intial post on csgojackpot: http://np.reddit.com/r/CSGOJackpot/comments/32o44m/machne_mod_fatality_scammed_me_lol/\\n\\nBackstory: Me and Mach!ne decided to bet together and split 50/50, nothing seemed sketchy seeing that he was a CSGOJackpot Mod and a streamer. He added me to his TS3, we chatted and then bet. Well we won a few pots, split evenly no big deal. After a while Fatality joined in in the teamspeak. He asks if he can also get in on the 3 way splits and both Mach!ne and I agreed. We go in, the pot is like 4k and Fatality wins so we all verbally agree on splitting 3 ways. \\n\\nAs we\\'re waiting for CSGOJackpot to send the returns, Fatality sends me a private message on TS3 asking if I want to go 50/50 on the pot and my response is screenshot\\'d and shown here (http://i.imgur.com/Upp6I2x.png). Not long after Mach!ne messages me on steam accusing me of trying to scam him, and as I respond with what really happened he blocks me on steam and bans me from his TS3 without even waiting for my response or screenshots (TS Info removed, sorry guys). Shortly after I see both Mach!ne and Fatality going back in on pots... with my winnings as well lmao.\\n\\nSo here\\'s the gist of it, I frankly don\\'t care that I lost the skins it\\'s just virtual shit that I didn\\'t have real money invested in anyway because it was all gained from betting BUT these two guys are supposedly well known streamers and those who support their streams need to know that they are also supporting scammers.\\n\\nLastly, I know someone (or alot) of people will be like \"blah blah thats what you get for trying to snipe pots blah blah\" Realize that just about every big CSGOJackpot streamer also goes in with friends and splits. In fact we were basically competing against the Dino team all night. Regardless, Fatality and Mach!ne are crooked scammers and it should be known being that they are well known streamers. I digress, later doods.\\n\\nEdit: As far as I know the mach!ne mentioned is certainly the one everyone presumes him to be but as far as fatal1ty or fatality whatever it is, the only information I remember him giving me verbally is that he is from Denmark \\n\\nEdit:  **I want to clarify that I hardly believe this to be the fatality I am referring to (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fatalitycsgo/). The last thing I\\'d want to do is tarnish the name of someone who was not involved and I highly doubt this is the guy.
