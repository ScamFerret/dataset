Either way, feuerzone is still way up front and not oversold so even if you\\'re at the back of it, you still have a prime spot.\\n\\n*Remember people in the first rows of feuerzone and GA MIGHT do a moshpit (which kinda sucks for people enjoying the show/small women, etc. Ideally there would be none but some people can\\'t help themselves. Also remember there could always be that one idiot who just FIGHTS with people in the pit so ..stay clear of moshpit areas / front rows unless you\\'re prepared to deal with bullshit) \\n\\n\\nAlso good to remember/consider the following, as I\\'ve met people who had their night ruined and also experienced it myself in the past : \\n\\n-Do I want to go REALLY early with the best spot possible but by the time 8PM comes, I might be exhausted and not enjoy the show so much ?\\n\\nOr\\n\\n-Do I compromise my spot a bit, but have full energy to enjoy the show?\\n\\nIt all depends on everyone\\'s physical state but the latter makes for a really great night. At the Montreal concert, we experienced the front of GA and for the encores, the back of GA and can confirm we had more of a good time being free to move around and dance in the back. A Rammstein concert is still a crazy good time even at the back.\\n\\n\\nYES YOU SHOULD WEAR EARPLUGS! Hearing loss is no joke.\\n-\\n\\n\\nFinally, if anyone wants to meet me, I\\'ll gladly hang and enjoy the concert with any fans sharing GOOD VIBES. I know every lyric and will bring it! (Don\\'t worry I sing well :)) Also if we can help each other, etc., always cool to do what we can. I\\'m aiming to enter around 6pm, general admission, friendly Canadian, 6ft5, will be wearing yellow cap, black glasses, full beard and this shirt :\\nhttps://cdn.media.amplience.net/s/hottopic/18865557_hi?$productMainDesktop$\\n\\nCan\\'t wait !', 'comments': [\"All photos, videos, questions, and general comments from a specific concert have to be posted in their corresponding megathread.

Too bad it will likely get deleted. 😤', \"General parking info for Gillette Stadium: \\nI know a lot of people are thinking that they can park in the retail lots for free and just go to the concert and then leave without paying. As someone who goes to Gillette more times a year than he can count (Revolution matches, Patriot games, etc...) that is not a risk anyone should take. The tow trucks will be in the lots and they will be chalking tires. You will not get a ticket, they will tow you. It will be an expensive fee to get your car out.\\nIf you have GA or FZ tickets pre-pay for your parking in lots 3 and 4. They are the closest to the Ticketmaster gate. \\n\\nSecurity/entry:\\nThere are scanners at the entrances to the stadium. You do not have to take anything out of your pockets there are security staff watching monitors of everyone that walks through the gate.\\nThe ticket readers are self service turnstiles. You will either scan the barcode in the Ticketmaster/Gillette Stadium app. Or (my personal preference) transfer your ticket to your Apple wallet. There are RFID scanners at the top of the turnstiles that are much faster than trying to scan your barcodes.\\n\\nTeamOps: Honestly they suck. They have zero hesitation to throw anyone out without any warning. \\nPolice Presence: There will be Foxboro PD along with MA State police. Foxboro PD always has a chip on their shoulder. They are very heavy handed. If you have any issues I would look for a Statie over Foxboro PD.\\n\\nConcessions are cashless. Debit/CC/Apple Pay/ Google Wallet. Bud Light. Coors, etc are about $10 a botttle. There are a ton of craft beers around the stadium that range from $13-$16 a can. There are  3 Ale House locations that have a ton of choices. My personal place to go is on the inside of the concourse just below 205. They have Tilted Barn which is a fantastic brewery just south of Providence. Some locations allow mobile ordering and pickup for food but the food here is really not that good.\\nCan't wait for tomorrow!\", 'Debating about going to the show since I’ll be coming solo from about 2 hours away. The parking situation scares me as well. I do hear it truly sucks there.', 'I’m a Walpole/Foxboro local and If you’re interested in taking the Commuter rail from Boston or Providence, there is a train that drops you off basically in front of the stadium on a set schedule. I would highly recommend this instead of taking the train to Walpole, as the station is about 4 miles away and taxi/Uber service isn’t the most reliable. Here’s a link with the schedule\\n\\nhttps://www.mbta.com/destinations/gillette-stadium']}, {'title': 'The_Donald sees communism everywhere, but has somehow never seen the Heineken logo', 'subreddit': 'facepalm', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/dmwbomwbti0z.jpg', 'selftext': '', 'comments': ['I wonder how they feel about the Navy using the red nautical star.', 'Heineken using the Heineken logo, must be up to something!', '[NBC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/NBC_logo.svg/200px-NBC_logo.svg.png) has been pro LGBT for decades!!!\\n\\nOpen your eyes sheeple!', 'To be fair, many of the comments on that picture point this out. \\n\\nI like to browse T_D for fun sometimes.', 'Heineken confirmed Soviet sleeper agent']}]"

However, this lack of information does not rule out the possibility that the website is a scam. Based on the WHOIS information, the recent creation of the domain, and the content that does not align with what would be expected from a legitimate Verizon customer service website, I am inclined to believe that this website could be a scam. I do not have concrete evidence of scam activity, but the signs are pointing towards it. I will proceed to the final step to see if there's any unusual payment method mentioned on the website, which could be another strong indicator of a scam.",
