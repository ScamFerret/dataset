One review explicitly states that they \"faked being several companies to scam my elderly mother,\" which is a strong indication of fraudulent activity. This aligns with the characteristic of providing information on non-existent companies. Moreover, the fact that there's a report of them claiming to be different companies suggests that they may not be a legitimate business. To further solidify my analysis, I should check for any additional online presence or complaints, such as on social platforms or forums like Reddit.",
