The damage dealt by her Skill is increased via Crystal Shrapnel Charges, which are gained through the Crystallize reaction and her Elemental Burst. Although Navia’s damage is focused on her Skill, the rest of her kit is also important as her Burst provides off-field Geo application and her A1 Passive provides Geo Conversion to her Normal Attacks.\\n\\nIn practice, this means that Navia should open with her Burst, swap off so her teammates can use their abilities, and swap back on-field to use her Skill and Normal Attack combos.\\n\\n| **Pros** | **Cons** |\\n|:-|:-|\\n|  Unique kit that utilizes the Crystallize reaction|  Navia’s kit does not have much AoE|\\n|  Good, front-loaded damage with her Skill|  Difficult ER requirements without enough Favonius weapons, proper batterying, or Constellation 1|\\n|  ATK scalings mean Navia can benefit from many buffs like Bennett’s Burst, 4pc Noblesse Oblige, and 4pc Tenacity of the Millelith|  Best supports — Zhongli and Geo Traveler — may require some practice with construct placement|\\n|  “Elegant yet lethal Gunbrella”|  Short rotations (16.5s) can be awkward for buffs and teammate abilities with longer cooldowns, such as Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers and Furina (20s)|\\n\\n \\n\\nQuickswap DPS\\n\\nNavia as a quickswap DPS has little field time, only swapping in to cast her Burst and later her Skill. In teams where the on-field DPS is not Geo, Crystal Shrapnel Charges are dependent on Navia’s Burst. As such, Navia’s ER requirements are quite high and she does not gain as many Crystal Shrapnel Charges compared to her on-field playstyle (2–3 instead of 4–6).\\n\\nWhile quickswap teams with on-field Geo units (such as Noelle and Ningguang) are viable, they do not make the best use of Navia’s kit and will not be covered in this quick guide.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Talents\\n\\n \\n\\n### Talent Priority\\n\\n*  Skill > Normal Attack ≥ Burst \\n\\nNavia’s Elemental Skill makes up the majority of her damage, so leveling her Elemental Skill should be prioritized. Her Normal Attack and Elemental Burst contribute less damage, but they are still relevant in her damage profile and should still be leveled. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n### Talent Overview\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Normal Attack | Blunt Refusal**\\n\\nWith her A1 Passive, Navia gains a Geo Conversion and a buff to her Normal Attacks, allowing her to trigger Crystallize and obtain Crystal Shrapnel Charges. Outside of the Geo Conversion, Navia’s Normal Attacks deal mediocre Physical damage. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Elemental Skill | Ceremonial Crystalshot**\\n\\nNavia’s Elemental Skill is her main method of dealing damage. It possesses a stacking mechanic called Crystal Shrapnel, where Navia can hold up to 6 Crystal Shrapnel Charges at a time. Charges are obtained via any teammate picking up Crystallize shards or granted periodically when Navia’s Burst hits an enemy.\\n\\nHer Tap Skill consumes all Crystal Shrapnel Charges to fire a ranged shot of Rosula Shardshots, dealing Geo damage which pierces through enemies in its path. Her Hold Skill causes her to enter aiming mode, absorbing nearby Crystallize shards before consuming all Crystal Shrapnel Charges to fire the Rosula Shardshots. Navia’s Hold Skill absorbs nearby Crystallize shards fairly quickly and in waves of three. If there are Crystallize shards nearby and Navia does not have max Crystal Shrapnel Charges, a brief Hold Skill should be used. Note that Navia may struggle to hit aerial enemies as her Hold Skill cannot aim upwards. Both the Tap and Hold variations generate 3–4 Energy Particles.\\n\\nThe damage from Navia’s Skill is **based on how many Rosula Shardshots hit the enemy**. Each additional Shardshot that hits is a multiplicative increase to the base multiplier listed on the Talent description (671.16% at Talent Level 9) — see the table below. At 0/1/2/3 Crystal Shrapnel Charges, Navia fires 5/7/9/11 Rosula Shardshots. If all 11 Shardshots land, her Elemental Skill deals 200% of the base damage. For 4/5/6 Charges, she will gain an additional 15/30/45% Geo DMG Bonus for the used Skill.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n| **Shrapnel Charges** | **Rosula Shardshots** | **% of Base Damage** |\\n|:-|:-|:-|\\n|0|5| 120% |\\n|1|7| 140% |\\n|2|9| 166.6% |\\n|3|11| 200% |\\n|4|11| 200% + 15% Geo DMG Bonus |\\n|5|11| 200% + 30% Geo DMG Bonus |\\n|6|11| 200% + 45% Geo DMG Bonus |\\n\\nNavia’s Skill has a cooldown of 9s and 2 charges (uses); only 1 Skill charge recovers cooldown at a time. Her Skill also summons a Surging Blade that deals Ousia-aligned Geo damage on a 7s cooldown. \\n\\n \\n\\n* **Elemental Burst | As the Sunlit Sky’s Singing Salute**\\n\\nNavia’s Elemental Burst deals initial AoE Geo damage and afterwards provides Fire Support, which deals AoE Geo damage periodically for 12 seconds. Fire Support persists even if Navia swaps off and hits once every \\\\~0.7s for a total of 17 hits over its duration. It also grants Navia 1 Crystal Shrapnel Charge when it hits enemies, with a 2.4s cooldown.\\n\\nNavia’s Elemental Burst has a 15s cooldown and 60 Energy Cost. Fire Support has non-standard Internal Cooldown — every 3 hits — and is a dynamic ability (e.g., it will lose Bennett’s buff when Navia swaps off-field). While the damage is fine, Navia’s Burst is more important for increasing Crystal Shrapnel Charges, either directly by hitting enemies or by triggering Crystallize via its Geo application.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Ascension 1 Passive | Undisclosed Distribution Channels**\\n\\nNavia’s Normal Attacks, Charged Attacks, and Plunging Attacks receive a Geo Conversion for 4s after using her Elemental Skill, while also granting her a 40% DMG Bonus to Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks. This allows Navia to trigger Crystallize and therefore gain Crystal Shrapnel Charges while she is on-field. Because of its low duration, Navia generally does not stay on-field as long as other on-field DPS units. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Ascension 4 Passive | Mutual Assistance Network**\\n\\nNavia naturally wants to team with Pyro/Electro/Cryo/Hydro characters for Crystallize, so this is a small but welcome damage buff. Note that the two Elements do not need to be unique (e.g., two Hydro characters still grant two stacks). \\n\\n \\n\\n# Constellations\\n\\nCalcs for Constellation comparisons can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Zs5p7pVBSAoKeeYKBhWvFNhe7XXwgwfTcgu1oYKSho/edit#gid=334085131) (last updated for Version 4.3). \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Constellation 1 | A Lady’s Rules for Keeping a Courteous Distance**\\n\\n*\"Each stack of Crystal Shrapnel consumed when Navia uses Ceremonial Crystalshot will restore 3 Energy to her and decrease the CD of As the Sunlit Sky’s Singing Salute by 1s. Up to 9 Energy can be gained this way, and the CD of “As the Sunlit Sky’s Singing Salute” can be decreased by up to 3s.\"*\\n\\nAs Navia nearly always uses 2 Skills per rotation, each with \\\\~6 Crystal Shrapnel Charges, this Constellation effectively reduces her Burst cost from 60 to 42 and drastically lowers her ER requirements.\\n\\nThe Burst cooldown reduction is unfortunately insignificant since Navia’s rotations generally do not support using her Burst more than once, not to mention the increase in ER% needed to do so.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Constellation 2 | The President’s Pursuit of Victory**\\n\\n*\"Each stack of Crystal Shrapnel consumed will increase the CRIT Rate of this Ceremonial Crystalshot instance by 12%. CRIT Rate can be increased by up to 36% in this way.*  \\n*In addition, when Ceremonial Crystalshot hits an opponent, one Cannon Fire Support shot from As the Sunlit Sky’s Singing Salute will strike near the location of the hit. Up to one instance of Cannon Fire Support can be triggered each time Ceremonial Crystalshot is used, and DMG dealt by said Cannon Fire Support this way is considered Elemental Burst DMG.\"*\\n\\nThis Constellation effectively provides Navia’s Skill with a 36% CRIT Rate boost. In addition, it calls 1 shot of Fire Support when she uses her Skill, which can directly provide a Crystal Shrapnel Charge and potentially trigger Crystallize. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Constellation 3 | Businesswoman’s Broad Vision**\\n\\n*\"Increases the Level of Ceremonial Crystalshot by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15.\"*\\n\\nA decent damage increase, boosting the Talent levels of Navia’s main source of damage — her Elemental Skill. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Constellation 4 | The Oathsworn Never Capitulate**\\n\\n*\"When As the Sunlit Sky’s Singing Salute hits an opponent, that opponent’s\\xa0Geo RES\\xa0will be decreased by 20% for 8s.\"*\\n\\nA good damage increase. C4 decreases enemy Geo RES by 20% for 8s after Navia’s Burst hits. Since her Burst lasts 12s, this effectively provides 20s of Geo RES Shred, which benefits both Navia and her Geo teammates. Combined with Geo Resonance, this is roughly equivalent to 4pc Viridescent Venerer’s RES Shred but for Geo. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Constellation 5 | Negotiator’s Resolute Negotiations**\\n\\n \"*Increases the Level of As the Sunlit Sky’s Singing Salute by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15.\"*\\n\\n A minor damage increase. Navia’s Burst only makes up a small portion of her damage profile. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Constellation 6 | The Flexible Finesse of the Spina’s President**\\n\\n*\"If more than 3 stacks of Crystal Shrapnel are consumed when using Ceremonial Crystalshot, each stack consumed beyond the first 3 increases the CRIT DMG of that Ceremonial Crystalshot by 45%, and any stacks consumed beyond the first 3 are returned to Navia.\"*\\n\\n \\n\\nA very powerful capstone Constellation that provides large benefits to Navia’s Skill.\\xa0\\n\\nNavia’s Constellation 6 refunds any Crystal Shrapnel Charges consumed past 3, effectively making the max Charges consumed 3 instead of 6. For each Charge consumed beyond the first 3, Navia’s Skill will gain 45% CRIT DMG (additive). In other words, when C6 Navia fires her Skill with 6 Crystal Shrapnel Charges:\\n\\n* 11 Rosula Shardshots will be fired.\\n* Her Skill deals 200% the base damage + 45% Geo DMG Bonus (same as C0).\\n* Her Skill gains an additional 135% CRIT DMG.\\n* The net number of Charges consumed is 3.\\n\\nOverall, C6 is around a \\\\~40% increase to her Skill’s damage, and the refund mechanic helps smoothen rotations while making it far easier for Navia to gain and maintain max Charges on her Skill.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n#  Teambuilding\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[ Navia — Geo — Elemental Flex — Elemental Flex ](https://preview.redd.it/tgl6jb6xzrxc1.jpg?width=1279&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69f0ceb5c96c683302a65b5254ccd2c33c5485e9)\\n\\nNavia’s A4 and Skill take advantage of the Crystallize reaction, so she is incentivized to run with two Elemental teammates (Pyro, Electro, Cryo, and/or Hydro). A Geo unit is highly appreciated to reduce Navia’s ER requirements and also enable Geo Resonance; Navia has high uptime on the Geo Resonance buffs and debuffs due to all the Crystallize shields. Note that these Crystallize shields are not good as the sole form of survivability, so one of the teammates should provide survivability.\\n\\nAlthough Navia is an on-field DPS, she does not have extremely long field time. Because her Skill has 2 charges (uses), one of her Skills’ cooldowns is always counting down during the rotation, meaning she can shorten the rotation time to 16.5s. This desynced Skill cooldown catches up after \\\\~4 rotations, where Navia then swaps to 18s rotations. While shorter rotations increase DPS, it is often awkward to accommodate buffs and teammates with 20s cooldowns — such as Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers and Xingqiu — into Navia’s teams.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n **General Guide to Rotations**\\n\\n| **Geo Unit E¹ > Navia Q > cycle through teammates’ abilities > Navia 2\\\\[E N3D N2\\\\]** |\\n|:-|\\n| ¹Funnel the particles from the Geo teammate’s Skill to Navia, if possible. |\\n\\nNavia’s very first Skill use usually has \\\\~4 Crystal Shrapnel Charges. Her second Skill and all later rotations should have 6 Crystal Shrapnel Charges. Use a brief Hold Skill if there are nearby Crystallize shards and Navia does not have max Crystal Shrapnel Charges. Otherwise, Tap Skill is perfectly fine.\\n\\nDepending on the rotation, Navia may want to swap out between her Skill uses (e.g., for Geo Traveler to funnel more particles to Navia). Also note that the last \\\\[D N2\\\\] after Navia’s second Skill can be omitted for a tighter rotation, if preferred.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Notable Teammates**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n| **Zhongli** |Zhongli provides a strong shield for survivability and Universal RES Shred. He can also generate particles with Favonius Lance and his pillar, but note that missing or breaking his pillar is detrimental to Navia’s ER needs. |\\n|:-|:-|\\n| **Geo Traveler** |Geo Traveler is very good at generating particles with their Skill, and they provide a CRIT Rate buff at C1. Proper placement of their constructs requires practice. For information on Geo Traveler’s mechanics and construct placement, please see the [Geo Traveler Extended Guide](https://keqingmains.com/geo-traveler/#Rock_Tech). |\\n| **Albedo** |Albedo is easy to use and also has good particle generation, provided that his flower construct does not break. Although ATK buffs for Navia will not benefit Albedo’s DEF scalings, his personal damage is still respectable. |\\n| **Ningguang** |Ningguang as a support sacrifices her own personal damage to hold Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers and provide a small Geo DMG% buff with her A4. Although Ningguang’s C2 gives her a second charge on her Skill, her 6s particle cooldown prevents her from being a better Geo battery than the other options. |\\n| **Yun Jin** |**Not recommended.**Yun Jin also does not have great particle generation and has her own Energy issues. While Yun Jin’s buff to Normal Attacks is nice, Normal Attacks are not the main source of Navia’s damage. |\\n| **Gorou** |**Not recommended.**Gorou is anti-synergistic with Navia since he incentivizes having three Geo teammates, contrary to Navia’s A4 Passive. Additionally, Navia’s ATK scalings do not benefit from Gorou’s DEF buffs. |\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Elemental Flex**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n| **Bennett** |Bennett condenses healing and buffing in one slot. His ATK buff is a massive benefit to Navia and potentially her teammates. The other flex unit should have consistent off-field Elemental application (for Crystallize) and damage since Bennett does not provide much of his own. |\\n|:-|:-|\\n| **Furina** |Due to Furina’s HP mechanics, a strong healer is necessary to take full advantage of Furina’s buffs (see [Notable Teammates in Furina’s Quick Guide](https://keqingmains.com/q/furina-quickguide/#Notable_Teammates)). Furina’s Skill also has an awkward 20s cooldown and 30s duration, forcing you to either extend the rotation to 20s or cast Furina’s Skill every other rotation (with some downtime).Nevertheless, if you can work around these caveats, Furina provides a very useful DMG% buff as well as some off-field Hydro application and damage. |\\n| **Off-Field DPS Units** |Navia appreciates any character who provides good off-field Elemental damage and application. Some characters who fulfill this role include [Fischl](https://keqingmains.com/q/fischl-quickguide/), [Xiangling](https://keqingmains.com/q/xiangling-quickguide/), [Yelan](https://keqingmains.com/q/yelan-quickguide/), [Xingqiu](https://keqingmains.com/q/xingqiu-quickguide/), [Rosaria](https://keqingmains.com/q/rosaria-quickguide/), and [Yae Miko](https://keqingmains.com/q/yae-quickguide/).Fischl is particularly notable since her cooldowns synergize well with Navia’s. |\\n\\n \\n\\n**Example Teams**\\n\\nThis is not a comprehensive list of teams. The inclusion or exclusion of any given team does not necessarily reflect its power level. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Navia — Zhongli — Fischl — Bennett** \\n\\nOne of Navia’s best teams. Zhongli, Fischl, and Bennett are all synergistic with Navia for the reasons stated earlier in the Notable Teammates section. Fischl should alternate between Skill and Burst each rotation, and Oz can snapshot Bennett’s ATK buff. Using a Normal Attack after Zhongli’s Hold Skill helps trigger Favonius Lance’s passive. \\n\\n**Sample Rotation**  \\nZhongli ED N1 > Navia Q > Bennett EQ > Fischl E/Q > Navia E N3D N2 E N3 > Bennett E N1 \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n*  **Navia — Ningguang — Furina — Kokomi** \\n\\nFurina provides a powerful DMG% buff, while Kokomi’s healing is necessary to take full advantage of Furina’s kit.\\n\\nThis team prefers a 20s rotation since Furina’s Skill and Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers (on Kokomi) both have 20s cooldowns. Kokomi uses her Burst and a few Normal Attacks to refresh her Skill’s jellyfish and provide some team healing. Since Kokomi already holds Thrilling Tales, Ningguang can be built more for damage, although her ER requirements can be significant if she is funneling two sets of Skill particles to Navia.\\n\\n**Sample Rotation**  \\nFurina ED Q > Ningguang Q E > Navia Q > Kokomi E > Navia E N3D N2 > Kokomi Q N2D N2 > Ningguang E > Navia E N3 \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n*  **Navia — Zhongli — Furina — Bennett** \\n\\nFurina provides a massive DMG% buff while Bennett provides a massive ATK buff. Bennett is recommended to be on a healer build so that he can overheal and proc Furina’s A1. Using a Normal Attack after Zhongli’s Hold Skill helps trigger Favonius Lance’s passive, and he should also be swapped into during Bennett’s Burst to receive healing.\\n\\n**Sample Rotation**  \\nZhongli ED N1 > Furina ED Q > Navia Q > Bennett EQ > Navia E N3 > Zhongli E > Navia E N3 > Bennett E N1\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Community Links \\n\\n**Our Community Resources and Credit\\'s**\\n\\n* [Navia Gacha Megathreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/naviamains/comments/18mjdw4/navia_mains_banner_gacha_rolls/)\\n* [Navia Mains Discord](https://discord.gg/naviamains)\\n* Art Credit\\'s both [old.reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/naviamains/) (Banner) & [new.reddit](https://new.reddit.com/r/naviamains/) (Background) by [@Shade of a cat](https://www.hoyolab.com/article/21503835)\\n* Sidebar art New Reddit by [@pponnya](https://twitter.com/pponnya/status/1693946625113423949)\\n* Emoji on Comment\\'s Section Permission to Use by [Navia Mains Discord](https://discord.gg/naviamains)\\n* Icon Subreddit Permission to Use by [Navia Mains Discord](https://discord.gg/naviamains)\\n* [Navia Quick Guides by KQM](https://keqingmains.com/q/navia-quickguide/#Artifact_Stats)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Guides & Helpful Links**\\n\\n* [COMPLETE NAVIA GUIDE!
