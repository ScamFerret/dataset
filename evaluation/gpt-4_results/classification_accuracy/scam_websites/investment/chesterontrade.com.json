Claims of a high success rate which seems too good to be true. 3. The use of technical jargon such as \"powerful equipments\" like \"Antminer S19 Pro ASIC Bitcoin miner\" may target human psychological weaknesses by creating a false sense of security through technical credibility. 4. Offers various investment packages with minimum and unlimited deposits, which is unusual for legitimate investment firms. 5. The presence of testimonials, which can be fabricated. 6. The company claims to have a history of over 23 years, yet this needs to be verified. Next, I need to verify the legitimacy of the contact information, company registration, and the update frequency of the website information.",
