        "thought": "The text extracted contains several red flags that align with common characteristics of scam websites: - Claims of unusually high returns on investment (ROI) with very short time frames (e.g., 4% after 24 hours). - Promises of guaranteed income and high profitability from crypto mining, which is a volatile and uncertain field. - The use of referral programs with high commissions, which is typical of Ponzi schemes. - Claims of being a large and reputable company with a significant number of professionals and data centers, which needs to be verified. - The website offers multiple investment opportunities, which is not typical for specialized investment firms.
