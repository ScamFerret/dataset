While this is a positive sign for website security, it does not necessarily mean that the website is not a scam, as many scam operations also secure SSL certificates to appear more legitimate.

While I do not have direct evidence of fraudulent activity, the observed characteristics align with common scam website traits. Given the information available, I will proceed with caution and lean towards the website being a potential scam. I now know the final answer.
