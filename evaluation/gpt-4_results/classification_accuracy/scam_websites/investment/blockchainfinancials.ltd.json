These principals guide our decision-making throughout the investment lifecycle. From the onset of the investment process, we pursue ideas inspired by environmental, social, and governance ('ESG') issues and participate in industries engaged with these themes. All companies in which we invest are first vetted by our professionals, who work closely with expert advisors, to identify and mitigate potential ESG conflicts. Our ESG due diligence program requires an assessment of ten key ESG areas which may impact the current or future performance of a company. One Equity Partners will forego any investment that fails to meet its ESG standards. Once invested, One Equity Partners reviews and monitors all its portfolio companies to ensure they adhere to its ESG policy, which is periodically reviewed to incorporate best practices as risks evolve. This process allows One Equity Partners to quickly detect and preempt or manage any difficulties that may arise during the investment period.
