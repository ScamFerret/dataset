There are also inconsistencies in the content, like mentioning \"ASTRO TRADES\" and \"Greenplanners\" interchangeably, and the use of generic testimonials. Furthermore, the website claims to offer a variety of unrelated products like agriculture, gold, Bitcoin mining, and real estate investments, which is suspicious. The text also contains unrelated news articles, which could be a way to manipulate SEO rankings. The contact email seems generic and not appropriate for a legitimate business. These observations align with characteristics 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of a scam website.",
