The only limiting factor is time, and CiG's willingness to assign a team of devs to work on it.\\n\\n*Disclaimer : This list isn't about bugs that need to be fixed nor expected features that aren't in the game yet. Just some small QoL changes that, in my opinion, would make the experience way better for everyone, especially new players.*\\n\\n# Save the last configuration when we leave the pilot's seat\\n\\nCiG should make it so the pilot's configuration remains unchanged upon leaving the seat. Whether it's the weapon control groups, panel displays, or the count of charged flares/missiles, it would be a great QoL change if any adjustments made could be automatically saved. This way, we won't have to reset everything each time we briefly step away from the pilot's seat.\\n\\nFor instance, upon entering my glaive, I have to undergo a painful series of manual tasks : disabling the S1 repeaters, adjusting the preloaded flares, customizing screen panels to my preference, preparing missiles if necessary... While I don't mind spending a minute in interaction mode for these actions, I find it bothersome to repeat these steps simply because I momentarily left my seat. \\n\\nI took the glaive as an example, but this issue becomes even more frustrating on larger ships, especially during situations where we're getting attacked while we're not on the pilot seat and we have to get ready for combat as quickly as possible. \\n\\nMoreover, certain landing gear interactions, like the Corsair's wings failing to unfold or the hover mode not activating by default on larger ships when raising or lowering landing gear, should also be considered.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Sunglasses / flight helmet with tinted visor.\\n\\nThat's one of the features that has been asked the most in the last few years. It's a wonder why it hasn't been implemented yet.\\n\\nThere could be two types of 'light-dimming' items : sunglasses when walking around to enjoy the landscapes without being blinded by the sun, and flight helmets with tinted visors for ship gameplay.\\n\\nI made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/14xdv91/cig_for_the_love_of_god_give_us_sunglasses_or/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about it a few months ago, and I still think that it would be awesome to get an item that allow us to reduce natural brightness.\\n\\nI understand why the gear system has been completely left to the side, and like the ship weapons, why it has been standardized. However, it wouldn't require much work to add a single helmet with a tinted visor that can dim high luminosity.\\n\\nCurrently, we have 5 types of gear : clothes, flight, light, medium, and heavy. CiG mentioned that, later, we wouldn't be able to fly all ships in heavy armor (which makes sense), but it would be nice if they could make the flight helmets relevant.\\n\\nRight now there is no point in wearing flight helmets, so giving them small QoL improvement—compared to other fps helmets—to help pilots would be a nice way to make them relevant. Without going too far into it, just being able to dim the sun's light or even the bright planets/moons' atmosphere would be insanely useful.\\n\\nAnother interesting idea would be to add graphic settings that can affect the planets/moons atmosphere brightness. I know CiG wants their game to be realistic, but if you want to use the lore as an excuse then it's kind of a joke that people hadn't developed the *ultra-mega-rare-and-advanced* technology called '**sunglasses'** in the 30th century.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Let us change the color of our ships' HUD.\\n\\nNo need to push the customization too far, just let us change the base color of our HUD.\\n\\nWhether you're in a Vanduul ship and can't see the party chat while in space, or you're in another ship with a brighter HUD and can't see your pip without sticking your face to your screen when you're flying around Crusader, Microtech, Yela, etc... We can all agree that it's a pain in the ass.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Let us buy/retrieve the sets of armor we pledged with real money in the game.\\n\\nNgl, pledged gear may be the biggest trap for new players who just started to play Star Citizen. If there's one thing that can be considered a real scam, that's the fps gear being sold in the pledge store (especially those that can be obtained in-game for a few thousand aeuc).\\n\\n**There are different ways to approach this issue :**\\n\\n**- 1st option :** let players buy the armor they pledged for with real cash in-game, in the common armor shops. It would be the easiest way since it wouldn't require much work on the coding side compared to the following options. CiG could even put a use-restriction on those armors if they don't want players to buy tons of armors just to sell them to other people in-game.\\n\\n**- 2nd option :** Similar to the first one, but a bit more time-consuming to implement. It would be to create new selling points that only sell armor/weapons you got from the pledge store. Same mechanics as above, but more work would be required.\\n\\n\\\\- **3rd option :** This one is more of an emergency patch than a permanent solution. It would be to make the game automatically transfer any pledge gear you had equipped from your dead body to the inventory of where you respawned. Kinda like what we already have when we end up in jail.\\n\\nNote that this option would be less stable and subject to more bugs. Also, it would only be a quick way to fix this issue until they implement awaited content such as armor pods.\\n\\n\\\\- **nt. :** just as I was writing this, a dev from CiG commented about this issue on Spectrum. Here's what he said : ***'We're adding functionality to retrieve lost gear from the pledge store in the upcoming Freight Elevator update. We'll share more information on exactly how it will work as we get closer.'***\\n\\nNow, the question is when is that Freight Elevator update lmao.\\n\\nAlso, I'm not sure that 'retrieval' is what players want since it would mean that whoever killed you wouldn't be able to loot your corpse, which wouldn't encourage ground gameplay.\\n\\nAllowing the armor to be bought again would make more sense, but that's just my opinion.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Interactions with your party member's ship, such as selling cargo or bed logging.\\n\\nThis one is self-explanatory. I know CiG is planning to revamp how the party system works, I just hope they will let us use our friend's ship freely as long as we're in the same party and/or the owner of the ship is in our friend list.\\n\\nThere could also be a system of authorization where you can allow x or y player to interact with your ship.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Add a cursor when aiming down sight with the multi-tool.\\n\\nSince the last update that affected tractor beams, it would be nice to have a little cursor (like a cross or a dot) when we ADS with the multi-tool. In space and orbit where there is no (or little) gravity, it would save us from inadvertently moving the ship instead of the cargo box we were aiming at.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Update the cargo grid for all ships, especially the oldest ones.\\n\\nBy update, I don't mean to completely rework all ships that have cargo space, but just to let us grid large boxes (24 & 32 SCU) in the ships that have more than enough space to accept them.\\n\\nFor example, we can't manually grid 32 SCU boxes in our own Caterpillars, even though it works perfectly fine on NPC Caterpillars.\\n\\nAnother example would be the Corsair which has enough place for at least 2 x 32 SCU boxes, and yet we can't grid them.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# ___\\n\\n*These suggestions are just based on my personal experience with the game, and I'm only sharing my opinion about them.

I will post all my account details so my strategy can be seen/copied. I will do this using only three or four trading setups. All of which are simple enough to learn. I will start trading on 10th January.\\n\\n\\\\----\\n\\nAs I see it there are two mains ways to understand how to make money in the markets. The first is to know what the biggest winners in the markets are doing and duplicating what they do. This is hard. Most of the biggest players will not publicly tell people what they are doing. You need to be able to kinda slide in with them and see if you can pick up some info. Not suitable for most people, takes a lot of networking and even then you have to be able to make the correct inferences.\\n\\nAnother way is to know the most common trades of losing traders and then be on the other side of their common mistakes. This is usually far easier, usually everyone knows the mind of a losing trader. I learned about what losing traders do every day by being one of them for many years. I noticed I had an some sort of affinity for buying at the very top of moves and selling at the very bottom. This sucked, however, is was obvious there was winning trades on the other side of what I was doing and the adjustments to be a good trader were small (albeit, tricky).\\n\\nThus began the study for entries and maximum risk:reward. See, there have been times I have bought aiming for a 10 pip scalps and hit 100 pips stops loss. Hell, there have been times I was going for 5 pips and hit 100 stop out. This can seem discouraging, but it does mean there must be 1:10 risk:reward pay-off on the other side of these mistakes, and they were mistakes.\\n\\nIf you repeatedly enter and exit at the wrong times, you are making mistakes and probably the same ones over and over again.  The market is tricking you! There are specific ways in which price moves that compel people to make these mistakes (I won’t go into this in this post, because it takes too long and this is going to be a long post anyway, but a lot of this is FOMO).\\n\\nMaking mistakes is okay. In fact, as I see it, making mistakes is an essential part of becoming an expert. Making a mistake enough times to understand intrinsically why it is a mistake and then make the required adjustments. Understanding at a deep level why you trade the way you do and why others make the mistakes they do, is an important part of becoming an expert in your chosen area of focus.\\n\\nI could talk more on these concepts, but to keep the length of the post down, I will crack on to actual examples of trades I look for. Here are my three main criteria. I am looking for tops/bottoms of moves (edge entries). I am looking for 1:3 RR or more potential pay-offs. My strategy assumes that retail trades will lose most of the time. This seems a fair enough assumption. Without meaning to sound too crass about it, smart money will beat dumb money most of the time if the game is base on money. They just will.\\n\\nSo to summarize, I am looking for the points newbies get trapped in bad positions entering into moves too late. From these areas, I am looking for high RR entries.\\n\\nSetup Examples.\\n\\nI call this one the “Lightning Bolt correction”, but it is most commonly referred to as a “two leg correction”. I call it a “Lightning Bolt correction” because it looks a bit like one, and it zaps you. If you get it wrong.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t4whwijse2721.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9050529c6e2472a3ff9f8e7137bd4a3ee5554cc\\n\\nOnce I see price making the first sell-off move and then begin to rally towards the highs again, I am waiting for a washout spike low. The common trades mistakes I am trading against here is them being too eager to buy into the trend too early and for the to get stopped out/reverse position when it looks like it is making another bearish breakout.  Right at that point they panic … literally one candle under there is where I want to be getting in. I want to be buying their stop loss, essentially. “Oh, you don’t want that ...okay, I will have that!”\\n\\nI need a precise entry. I want to use tiny stops (for big RR) so I need to be cute with entries. For this, I need entry rules. Not just arbitrarily buying the spike out. There are a few moving parts to this that are outside the scope of this post but one of my mains ways is using a fibs extension and looking for reversals just after the 1.61% level. How to draw the fibs is something else that is outside the scope of this but for one simple rule, they can be drawn on the failed new high leg.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cd682kve2721.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4d081c9faff49d0976f9ffab260aaed2b570309\\n\\nI am looking for a few specific things for a prime setup. Firstly, I am looking for the false hope candles, the ones that look like they will reverse the market and let those buying too early get out break-even or even at profit. In this case, you can see the hammer and engulfing candle off the 127 level, then it spikes low in that “stop-hunt” sort of style.\\n\\nSecondly I want to see it trading just past my entry level (161 ext). This rule has come from nothing other than sheer volume. The amount of times I’ve been stopped out by 1 pip by that little sly final low has gave birth to this rule. I am looking for the market to trade under support in a manner that looks like a new strong breakout. When I see this, I am looking to get in with tiny stops, right under the lows. I will also be using smaller charts at this time and looking for reversal clusters of candles. Things like dojis, inverted hammers etc. These are great for sticking stops under.\\n\\nImportant note, when the lightning bolt correction fails to be a good entry, I expect to see another two legs down. I may look to sell into this area sometimes, and also be looking for buying on another couple legs down. It is important to note, though, when this does not work out, I expect there to be continued momentum that is enough to stop out and reasonable stop level for my entry. Which is why I want to cut quick. If a 10 pips stop will hit, usually a 30 pips stop will too. Bin it and look for the next opportunity at better RR.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhkgy35ze2721.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=a18278b85b10278603e5c9c80eb98df3e6878232\\n\\nAnother setup I am watching for is harmonic  patterns, and I am using these as a multi-purpose indicator. When I see potentially harmonic patterns forming, I am using their completion level as take profits, I do not want to try and run though reversal patterns I can see forming hours ahead of time. I also use them for entering (similar rules of looking for specific entry criteria for small stops). Finally, I use them as a continuation pattern. If the harmonic pattern runs past the area it may have reversed from, there is a high probability that the market will continue to trend and very basic trend following strategies work well. I learned this from being too stubborn sticking with what I thought were harmonic reversals only to be ran over by a trend (seriously, everything I know I know from how it used to make me lose).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ytz2431f2721.png?width=1322&format=png&auto=webp&s=983a7f2a91f9195004ad8a2aa2bb9d4d6f128937\\n\\nA method of spotting these sorts of M/W harmonics is they tend to form after a second spike out leg never formed. When this happens, it gives me a really good idea of where my profit targets should be and where my next big breakout level is. It is worth noting, larger harmonics using have small harmonics inside them (on lower time-frames) and this can be used for dialling in optimum entries.  I also use harmonics far more extensively in ranging markets. Where they tend to have higher win rates.\\n\\nNext setup is the good old fashioned double bottoms/double top/one tick trap sort of setup. This comes in when the market is highly over extended. It has a small sell-off and rallies back to the highs before having a much larger sell-off. This is a more risky trade in that it sells into what looks like trending momentum and can be stopped out more. However, it also pays a high RR when it works, allowing for it to be ran at reduced risk and still be highly profitable when it comes through.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bx83776f2721.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c76c3085598ae70f4142d26c46c8d6e9b1c2881\\n\\nFrom these sorts of moves, I am always looking for a follow up buy if it forms a lightning bolt sort of setup.\\n\\nAll of these setups always offer 1:3 or better RR. If they do not, you are doing it wrong (and it will be your stop placement that is wrong). This is not to say the target is always 1:3+, sometimes it is best to lock in profits with training stops. It just means that every time you enter, you can potentially have a trade that runs for many times more than you risked. 1:10 RR can be hit in these sorts of setups sometimes. Paying you 20% for 2% risked.\\n\\nI want to really stress here that what I am doing is trading against small traders mistakes. I am not trying to “beat the market maker”. I am not trying to reverse engineer J.P Morgan’s black boxes. I do not think I am smart enough to gain a worthwhile edge over these traders. They have more money, they have more data, they have better softwares … they are stronger. Me trying to “beat the market maker” is like me trying to beat up Mike Tyson. I might be able to kick him in the balls and feel smug for a few seconds. However, when he gets up, he is still Tyson and I am still me. I am still going to be pummeled.\\n\\nI’ve seen some people that were fairly bright people going into training courses and coming out dumb as shit. Thinking they somehow are now going to dominate Goldman Sachs because they learned a chart pattern. Get a grip. For real, get a fucking grip. These buzz phrases are marketeering. Realististically, if you want to win in the markets, you need to have an edge over somebody.\\n\\nI don’t have edges on the banks. If I could find one, they’d take it away from me. Edges work on inefficiencies in what others do that you can spot and they can not. I do not expect to out-think a banks analysis team. I know for damn sure I can out-think a version of me from 5 years ago … and I know there are enough of them in the markets. I look to trade against them. I just look to protect myself from the larger players so they can only hurt me in limited ways.  Rather than letting them corner me and beat me to a pulp (in the form of me watching $1,000 drop off my equity because I moved a stop or something), I just let them kick me in the butt as I run away. It hurts a little, but I will be over it soon.\\n\\nI believe using these principles, these three simple enough edge entry setups, selectiveness (remembering you are trading against the areas people make mistakes, wait for they areas) and measured aggression a person can make impressive compounded gains over a year. I will attempt to demonstrate this by taking an account of under $100 to over $1,000 in a year. I will use max 10% on risk on a position, the risk will scale down as the account size increases. In most cases, 5% risk per trade will be used, so I will be going for 10-20% or so profits. I will be looking only for prime opportunities, so few trades but hard hitting ones when I take them.\\n\\n**I will start trading around the 10th January. Set remind me if you want to follow along**. I will also post my investor login details, so you can see the trades in my account in real time. Letting you see when I place my orders and how I manage running positions.\\n\\nI also think these same principles can be tweaked in such a way it is possible to flip $50 or so into $1,000 in under a month. I’ve done $10 to $1,000 in three days before. This is far more complex in trade management, though. Making it hard to explain/understand and un-viable for many people to copy (it hedges, does not comply with FIFO, needs 1:500 leverage and also needs spreads under half a pip on EURUSD - not everyone can access all they things).  I see all too often people act as if this can’t be done and everyone saying it is lying to sell you something. I do not sell signals. I do not sell training. I have no dog in this fight, I am just saying it can be done. There are people who do it. If you dismiss it as impossible; you will never be one of them.\\n\\nIf I try this 10 times with $50, I probably am more likely to make $1,000 ($500 profit) in a couple months than standard ideas would double $500 - I think I have better RR, even though I may go bust 5 or more times. I may also try to demonstrate this, but it is kinda just show-boating, quite honestly. When it works, it looks cool. When it does not, I can go bust in a single day (see example [https://www.fxblue.com/users/redditmicroflip](https://www.fxblue.com/users/redditmicroflip)).\\n\\nSo I may or may not try and demonstrate this. All this is, is just taking good basic concepts and applying accelerated risk tactics to them and hitting a winning streak (of far less trades than you may think). Once you have good entries and RR optimization in place - there really is no reason why you can not scale these up to do what may people call impossible (without even trying it).\\n\\nI know there are a lot of people who do not think these things are possible and tend to just troll whenever people talk about these things. There used to be a time when I’d try to explain why I thought the way I did … before I noticed they only cared about telling me why they were right and discussion was pointless. Therefore, when it comes to replies, I will reply to all comments that ask me a question regarding why I think this can be done, or why I done something that I done. If you are commenting just to tell me all the reasons you think I am wrong and you are right, I will probably not reply. I may well consider your points if they are good ones. I just do not entering into discussions with people who already know everything; it serves no purpose.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Addition.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI want to talk a bit more about using higher percentage of risk than usual. Firstly, let me say that there are good reasons for risk caps that people often cite as “musts”. There are reasons why 2% is considered optimum for a lot of strategies and there are reasons drawing down too much is a really bad thing.\\n\\nPlease do not be ignorant of this. Please do not assume I am, either. In previous work I done, I was selecting trading strategies that could be used for investment. When doing this, my only concern was drawdown metrics. These are essential for professional money management and they are also essential for personal long-term success in trading.\\n\\nSo please do not think I have not thought of these sorts of things Many of the reasons people say these things can’t work are basic 101 stuff anyone even remotely committed to learning about trading learns in their first 6 months. Trust me, I have thought about these concepts. I just never stopped thinking when I found out what public consensus was.\\n\\nWhile these 101 rules make a lot of sense, it does not take away from the fact there are other betting strategies, and if you can know the approximate win rate and pay-off of trades, you can have other ways of deriving optimal bet sizes (risk per trade). Using Kelly Criterion, for example, if the pay-off is 1:3 and there is a 75% chance of winning, the optimal bet size is 62.5%.  It would be a viable (high risk) strategy to have extremely filtered conditions that looked for just one perfect set up a month, makingover 150% if it was successful.\\n\\nLet’s do some math on if you can pull that off three months in a row (using 150% gain, for easy math). Start $100. Month two starts $250. Month three $625. Month three ends $1,562. You have won three trades. Can you win three trades in a row under these conditions? I don’t know … but don’t assume no-one can.\\n\\nThis is extremely high risk, let’s scale it down to meet somewhere in the middle of the extremes. Let’s look at 10%. Same thing, 10% risk looking for ideal opportunities. Maybe trading once every week or so. 30% pay-off is you win. Let’s be realistic here, a lot of strategies can drawdown 10% using low risk without actually having had that good a chance to generate 30% gains in the trades it took to do so. It could be argued that trading seldomly but taking 5\\\\* the risk your “supposed” to take can be more risk efficient than many strategies people are using.\\n\\nI am not saying that you should be doing these things with tens of thousands of dollars. I am not saying you should do these things as long term strategies. What I am saying is do not dismiss things out of hand just because they buck the “common knowns”.  There are ways you can use more aggressive trading tactics to turn small sums of money into they $1,000s of dollars accounts that you exercise they stringent money management tactics on.\\n\\nWith all the above being said, you do have to actually understand to what extent you have an edge doing what you are doing. To do this, you should be using standard sorts of risks. Get the basics in place, just do not think you have to always be basic. Once you have good basics in place and actually make a bit of money, you can section off profits for higher risk versions of strategies. The basic concepts of money management are golden. For longevity and large funds; learned them and use them! Just don’t forget to think for yourself once you have done that.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate -\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOkay, I have thought this through a bit more and decided I don't want to post my live account investor login, because it has my full name and I do not know who any of you are.

One will be FIFO compliant. It will trade only single trade positions. The other will not be FIFO compliant, it will open trades in batches. I will link up live account in a week or so.

Is it a scam? Is it a gamble? … No, it’s maths.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nCommon sense risk disclaimer: **Don’t be a dick! Don’t risk money you can’t afford to lose.**  Do not risk money doing these things until you can show a regular profit on low risk.\\n\\nLet’s talk about Crazy Kelly Compounding (CKC).  Kelly criterion is a method for selecting optimal bet sizes if the odds and win rate are known (in other words, once you have worked out how to create and assess your edge). You can Google to learn about it in detail. The formula for Kelly criterion is;\\n\\n((odds-1) \\\\* (percentage estimate)) - (1-percent estimate) / (odds-1) X 100\\n\\nNow let’s say you can filter down a strategy to have a 80% win rate. It trades very rarely, but it had a very high success rate when it does. Let’s say you get 1:2 RR on that trade. Kelly would give you an optimum bet size of about 60% here. So if you win, you win 120%.  Losing three trades in a row will bust you. You can still recover from anything less than that, fairly easily with a couple winning trades.\\n\\nThis is where CKC comes in. What if you could string some of these wins together, compounding the gains (so you were risking 60% each time)? What if you could pull off 6 trades in a row doing this?\\n\\nHere is the math;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3u6teqd7c721.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b958747b37b68ec2a769a8368b5cbebfe0e97ff\\n\\nThis shows years, substitute years for trades. 6 trades returns $11,338!  This can be done. The question really is if you are able to dial in good enough entries, filter out enough sub-par trades and have the guts to pull the trigger when the time is right.  Obviously you need to be willing to take the hit, obviously that hit gets bigger each time you go for it, but the reward to risk ratio is pretty decent if you can afford to lose the money.\\n\\nWe could maybe set something up to do this on cent brokers. So people can do it literally risking a couple dollars. I’d have to check to see if there was suitable spreads etc offered on them, though. They can be kinda icky.\\n\\nNow listen, I am serious … don’t be a dick. Don’t rush out next week trying to retire by the weekend. What I am showing you is the **EXTRA rewards** that come with being able to produce good solid results and being able to section off some money for high risk “all or nothing” attempts; using your *proven strategies.*\\n\\nI am not saying anyone can open 6 trades and make $11,000 … that is rather improbable. What I am saying is once you can get the strategy side right, and you can know your numbers; then you can use the numbers to see where the limits actually are, how fast your strategy can really go.\\n\\n**This CKC concept is not intended to inspire you to be reckless in trading, it is intended to inspire you to put focus on learning the core skills I am telling you that are behind being able to do this.**\", 'comments': ['Very good stuff men, I will follow your progress.

To do this, you should be using standard sorts of risks. Get the basics in place, just do not think you have to always be basic. Once you have good basics in place and actually make a bit of money, you can section off profits for higher risk versions of strategies. The basic concepts of money management are golden. For longevity and large funds; learned them and use them! Just don’t forget to think for yourself once you have done that.', 'I want to be apart of this journey.', \"IDK how many people would be interested in a cTrader copy version of this.

Regulations typically force US traders to only trade at US brokerages, while international traders have more choice. After considering location you need to consider how much capital you will start trading with as many have minimum deposit levels. Once you’ve narrowed that down you can compared spreads and execution. ECN brokers execute your orders straight through to their liquidity providers, while market maker brokers may pair up your trades with other clients. Market maker brokers typically will partially hedge your positions on the interbank market. Many consider this to be a conflict of interest and prefer to trade at an ECN broker who would have an active motive to see you succeed. Lastly, brokers run inherently risky business models so it is important to consider the risk of bankruptcy.\\n\\nwww.forexpeacearmy.com - Aggregates broker reviews.

Your best bet is using your bank or an online exchange service. Be prepared to pay a hefty fee.\\n\\n**I have money in one currency and need to exchange it into another sometime in the future, should I wait?** \\n\\nDon’t ask us this. We speculate intraday in FX and shouldn’t be relied on to tell you what’s best for you. Exchange the money when you need it.\\n\\n**I have an FX account, should I start trading demo or live?**\\n\\nThis is highly debatable. You should definitely demo trade until you have mastered how to use the trading platform on desktop and mobile. After that it’s up to you. Many think that the psychology of trading live vs demo trading is massively different. So it may pay to learn to trade live. Just be warned that most FX traders lose almost their entire first account so start with a low affordable balance.\\n\\n**What’s money management?**\\n\\nMoney management is a form of risk management and is arguably the most important aspect of your trading when it comes to long term survival. You should always enter trades with a stop loss - the distance of the stop allows you to calculate how large of a percent of your account balance will be lost if your trade stops out. You can run a monte carlo simulation to figure out the risk of having a number of trades go against you in a row to drain your account. The general rule is that you should only risk losing 1-4% of your account per trade entered. \\n\\nMore on this here: www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/06/fxmoneymgmt.asp[35] \\n\\nwww.swing-trade-stocks.com/money-management.html[36]\\n\\n**What about automated trading?**\\n\\nRetail FX traders have been known to program “Expert Advisors” (EAs) to automate trading. It’s generally advisable to stay away from that until you’re very experienced. Never buy an EA from a developer because the vast majority of them are scams.\\n\\n**What indicators are best?**\\n\\nThat’s up to you to test and find out. Many in this forum dislike oscillating indicators since they fail to capture the essence of what moves price. With experience you will discover what works best for you. In my experience indicators that are most popular with professional traders are those that provide trading “levels” such as pivot points, fibonacci, moving averages, trendlines, etc.\\n\\n**What timeframe should I trade?**\\n\\nPrice action can vary in different timeframes. In longer term timeframes the price action and fundamentals are much more clear. Unfortunately it would take a very long time to figure out whether or not what you’re doing is successful on longer timeframes. In shorter timeframes you can often tell very quickly if what you’re doing is profitable. Unfortunately there’s a lot more “noise” on these levels which can prove deceptive for those trying to learn. Therefore the best bet is to use a multi-timeframe analysis, working from top-down to come up with trades.\\n\\n**Should I trade using fundamental analysis (FA) of technical analysis (TA)?**\\n\\nThis is a long standing argument in these forums and elsewhere. I’ll settle it here - you should have an understanding of both. Yes there are traders who blindly ignore one of the other but a truly well rounded trader should understand and implement both into the analysis. The market is driven in the longer term through FA. But TA is necessary to give traders a place to enter and exit trades from a psychological risk/reward standpoint.\\n\\n**I’ve heard trading Binary Options is an easy way to make money?**\\n\\nThe general advice is to stay away from binaries. The structure of binary options is so that when you lose the broker wins. This incentive has created a very scammy industry where there are few legitimate binary options brokers. In addition in order to be profitable in binaries you have to win 55-65% of the time. That’s a much higher premium over spot FX.\\n\\n**Am I actually exchanging currencies?**\\n\\nYes and no. Your broker handles spot FX is currency pairs. Although they make an exchange at the settlement date they treat your position in your account as a virtual currency pair. Think of it like a contract where you can only buy or sell it as a pair. In this sense you are always long one currency while short another. You are merely speculating that one currency will appreciate or depreciate vs another.\\n\\n\\n**Why didn't my order fill?**\\n\\nEven if price appears to cross over a line on your chart it does not guarantee a fill. Different charting platforms chart different prices - some chart the bid price, some the ask price and some the midpoint price. To fill a limit order price needs to cross your limit's price plus the spread at the time that it is crossing. If it does not equal or exceed the spread then it will not fill. Be wary that in general spreads are not fixed. So what may fill at one time may not at another.\", 'comments': ['Great info!!']}, {'title': 'Ads for 2017-04-24 (1 / 2)', 'subreddit': 'PotentialHailCorp', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/PotentialHailCorp/comments/67czgq/ads_for_20170424_1_2/', 'selftext': '| Subreddit | Title | Brand |\\n|:----------|-----|:-----:|| mildlyinteresting | [These striped apples at Target came into the store this way](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/675nsk/these_striped_apples_at_target_came_into_the/) | Target |\\n| todayilearned | [TIL Microsoft paid 75 million dollars to Rockstar games in order to get Grand Theft Auto IV on their Xbox 360 and prevent from being exclusive to Sony\\'s PlayStation 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/675o12/til_microsoft_paid_75_million_dollars_to_rockstar/) | Microsoft |\\n| todayilearned | [TIL Microsoft paid 75 million dollars to Rockstar games in order to get Grand Theft Auto IV on their Xbox 360 and prevent from being exclusive to Sony\\'s PlayStation 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/675o12/til_microsoft_paid_75_million_dollars_to_rockstar/) | Xbox |\\n| movies | [Fast 9 Poster Posted on Tyrese\\'s verified Facebook page](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/675p1y/fast_9_poster_posted_on_tyreses_verified_facebook/) | Facebook |\\n| worldnews | [Why Rome sends trains filled with rubbish to Austria - BBC News](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/675pgt/why_rome_sends_trains_filled_with_rubbish_to/) | BBC |\\n| AskReddit | [SeriousFor background check, how to contact Walmart for employment verification from 12 years ago for company bought by WalMart?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/675pqx/seriousfor_background_check_how_to_contact/) | Walmart |\\n| LifeProTips | [LPT Wells Fargo automatically \"readjusts\" lowers your monthly student loan payments if you\\'ve made significant steps to lower your overall principle.
