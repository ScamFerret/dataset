        "thought": "The extracted text contains several red flags that align with characteristics of scam websites: 1. Claims of very high returns (e.g., \"High Yield\", \"Accruals every hour\", \"10% for 24 hours\", etc.) which are generally not possible and target psychological weaknesses. 2. The total deposit amount listed is unrealistically high, which is a common tactic used by scam websites to create an illusion of a successful platform. 3. The address provided \"41 Wigmore Street, Marylebone Company № 11768290\" could be fabricated or belong to a non-existent company; this needs to be verified. 4. The website offers an \"affiliate program\" which is a common tactic used by scam sites to spread their reach through referral systems. 5.

        "thought": "The WHOIS information shows that the domain was recently registered and the registrant details are redacted for privacy, which is not uncommon, but it can be used by scam websites to hide their identity. Also, the state/province listed is \"Anambra,\" which is in Nigeria—a country often associated with online scams. This information, combined with the red flags from the website's content, increases suspicion. Given the suspicious high yield claims, unrealistic total deposit amount, potentially false physical address, and privacy redacted WHOIS information, I am leaning towards the URL being a scam. However, I would like to perform a few more checks to confirm the website's legitimacy, like checking for customer feedback on external platforms and the website's SSL certificate.",

I would like to suprise them with the surge 2 for Christmas.', 'I\\'d like to have Darksiders Genesis (May 2021) please.\\n\\nI love the franchise and have been playing since its initial release on the PS3. At that time, it was too difficult for me (especially the part where I have to chuck the exploding eggs toward the dragon boss) and I put it down until Darksiders 2 was announced and I saw Death, and Death is EPIC. More so than War. I immediately picked my game up again and finished the thing and got into as much media as I can suck up until the release of Darksiders 2. Well, the release of Darksiders 2 was a mixed bag to me. I didn\\'t like the more colorful hues it brought to the world and I didn\\'t like how there\\'s sooooo much puzzles in every square inch of the map. Though I really like the combat. It\\'s so deep and expressive.\\n\\nThere was a long hiatus until Darksiders 3 was announced, and its shift to a more Soulslike formula got me really hooked! I just finished platinuming Bloodborne and I was craving for lots more games to \"git gud\" at. So I also got it day 1 and it was a blast to play. \\n\\nThe only entry in the series I haven\\'t played yet is Genesis, featuring Strife. But that was because it was barely on any sales and if it was, the price was still a bit too steep for me. Would be a big blessing if I win this one. Cheers!', \"CONTROL STANDARD EDITION from March 2021 games would be great.\\n\\nBecause I've always loved a game with a great story and from what I've heard it's got one of the best stories out there. Something that will keep me on the edge of my seat and I love such games as they are the one's I always don't have to make any effort to finish. Also this game has been evading me forever as it was given free in Amazon gaming for free but unfortunately the service isn't available in my country. \\n\\nI've heard that the gameplay is also very unique and would be grateful if given the chance to dive into it.\\n\\nThanks for doing this and take care.\"]}, {'title': 'Can someone with a bit of troubleshooting experience please help me?', 'subreddit': 'KerbalSpaceProgram', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1833r9u/can_someone_with_a_bit_of_troubleshooting/', 'selftext': 'I\\'ve been playing with mods for a while to figure out mods i would like to include, I\\'m mostly happy with how it looks except for random crashes.

Scale is hard to tell but this is clearly a suborbital vertical take-off vertical landing test article possibly for development of technologies related to re-usability with just a simple nosecone without much volume space. Propellant/Oxidizer cylindrical tank size is 1:1 and pressurant tanks are small so engine on this vehicle could be pump fed and likely uses hypergolic propellant. The fins indicate this vehicle could have some atmospheric flight time later in development and not just short hops from A to B but at the same time control surface doesn't look actuated.\\n\\nAll this and ISRO's way of working suggests this test vehicle might have some shared heritage and looking at inter-tank region I can't help but see in render its close resemblance to L40 strap-ons of GSLV Mk II (2.1 meter diameter), that is where those toroidal water tanks are. Toroidal water tanks ([blue donuts](https://imgur.com/a/rxZKj)) in GS2/PS2 and L110 are at the bottom of stage above Vikas engine(s) (sprayed water is used to control temperatures in gas generator). Apart from that there is some bits in inter tank area not sure if for roll control or something else. Vikas engine gimbal on L40 Strap-ons is limited to single plane so that would change for this vehicle among other things.\\n\\nLegs look one time deployable. May be at some time in development they'd be in stowed configuration during launch. Talking about launch and development tests what facilities and high ceiling test areas are suitable for this? Mahendragiri doesn't fit the the bill for flight tests, Challakere in Chitradurga district doesn't have much at the moment so SDSC SHAR (Sriharikota) again could be an obvious choice.\\n\\nHere is [side by side comparison with L40 strapon.](https://i.imgur.com/KrgkwAQ.png)\", 'comments': [\"This is a really interesting find!

I would like to suprise them with the surge 2 for Christmas.', 'I\\'d like to have Darksiders Genesis (May 2021) please.\\n\\nI love the franchise and have been playing since its initial release on the PS3. At that time, it was too difficult for me (especially the part where I have to chuck the exploding eggs toward the dragon boss) and I put it down until Darksiders 2 was announced and I saw Death, and Death is EPIC. More so than War. I immediately picked my game up again and finished the thing and got into as much media as I can suck up until the release of Darksiders 2. Well, the release of Darksiders 2 was a mixed bag to me. I didn\\'t like the more colorful hues it brought to the world and I didn\\'t like how there\\'s sooooo much puzzles in every square inch of the map. Though I really like the combat. It\\'s so deep and expressive.\\n\\nThere was a long hiatus until Darksiders 3 was announced, and its shift to a more Soulslike formula got me really hooked! I just finished platinuming Bloodborne and I was craving for lots more games to \"git gud\" at. So I also got it day 1 and it was a blast to play. \\n\\nThe only entry in the series I haven\\'t played yet is Genesis, featuring Strife. But that was because it was barely on any sales and if it was, the price was still a bit too steep for me. Would be a big blessing if I win this one. Cheers!', \"CONTROL STANDARD EDITION from March 2021 games would be great.\\n\\nBecause I've always loved a game with a great story and from what I've heard it's got one of the best stories out there. Something that will keep me on the edge of my seat and I love such games as they are the one's I always don't have to make any effort to finish. Also this game has been evading me forever as it was given free in Amazon gaming for free but unfortunately the service isn't available in my country. \\n\\nI've heard that the gameplay is also very unique and would be grateful if given the chance to dive into it.\\n\\nThanks for doing this and take care.\"]}, {'title': 'Can someone with a bit of troubleshooting experience please help me?', 'subreddit': 'KerbalSpaceProgram', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1833r9u/can_someone_with_a_bit_of_troubleshooting/', 'selftext': 'I\\'ve been playing with mods for a while to figure out mods i would like to include, I\\'m mostly happy with how it looks except for random crashes.

Scale is hard to tell but this is clearly a suborbital vertical take-off vertical landing test article possibly for development of technologies related to re-usability with just a simple nosecone without much volume space. Propellant/Oxidizer cylindrical tank size is 1:1 and pressurant tanks are small so engine on this vehicle could be pump fed and likely uses hypergolic propellant. The fins indicate this vehicle could have some atmospheric flight time later in development and not just short hops from A to B but at the same time control surface doesn't look actuated.\\n\\nAll this and ISRO's way of working suggests this test vehicle might have some shared heritage and looking at inter-tank region I can't help but see in render its close resemblance to L40 strap-ons of GSLV Mk II (2.1 meter diameter), that is where those toroidal water tanks are. Toroidal water tanks ([blue donuts](https://imgur.com/a/rxZKj)) in GS2/PS2 and L110 are at the bottom of stage above Vikas engine(s) (sprayed water is used to control temperatures in gas generator). Apart from that there is some bits in inter tank area not sure if for roll control or something else. Vikas engine gimbal on L40 Strap-ons is limited to single plane so that would change for this vehicle among other things.\\n\\nLegs look one time deployable. May be at some time in development they'd be in stowed configuration during launch. Talking about launch and development tests what facilities and high ceiling test areas are suitable for this? Mahendragiri doesn't fit the the bill for flight tests, Challakere in Chitradurga district doesn't have much at the moment so SDSC SHAR (Sriharikota) again could be an obvious choice.\\n\\nHere is [side by side comparison with L40 strapon.](https://i.imgur.com/KrgkwAQ.png)\", 'comments': [\"This is a really interesting find!
