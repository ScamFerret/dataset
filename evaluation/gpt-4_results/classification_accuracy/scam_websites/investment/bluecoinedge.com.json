        "thought": "The text extracted from the website contains several potential red flags that align with common characteristics of scam websites. Claims of high returns with little risk, such as \"Fan Token Trade 5% After 1 Day\" and \"HedgeSwap Trade 9.6% Hourly for 24Hours,\" are usually unrealistic and could be indicative of a scam. Additionally, the site claims to be a \"SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT AGENCY\" and offers a range of investment plans with high returns, which is suspicious. I should verify the legitimacy of the company and its claims by checking their registration and contact information.",
