        "thought": "The extracted text from the website provides several points to consider. The website seems to be promoting investment in gold and cryptocurrency with high returns, which can be a red flag. Claims like \"20% AFTER 3 DAYS\" and \"$300,000 IN 6 MONTHS\" are unusually high returns and could indicate a scam. Additionally, the mention of a \"certified and licensed\" company in Romania, instant withdrawals, and high referral commissions are also suspicious. The use of emotional testimonials without verifiable background information targets psychological weaknesses. It is also unusual for a legitimate investment company to have a minimum withdrawal limit. The next step is to verify the legitimacy of the company and the website.",
