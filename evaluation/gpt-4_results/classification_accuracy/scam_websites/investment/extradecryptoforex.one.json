        "thought": "The extracted text shows several red flags that are common in scam websites: 1. Promises of high returns with phrases like \"min. Expected profit: $3,500\" from a $500 deposit and \"max. expected profit: $50,000\". 2. Claims of a high success rate in trading signals, \"95% Success Rate\", which is unusually high and unrealistic in the financial trading world. 3. The use of psychological triggers with phrases like \"Get more freedom\", \"Not Just by Words. Our experts ensure...\", and \"Trade with confidence\". 4. The presence of multiple financial instruments and markets, which is not typical for a specialized trading platform. 5. The contact email support@extradecryptoforex.one seems generic and unprofessional for a business. 6. The privacy policy and legal terms are mentioned, but no specifics are provided in the extracted text. 7. The website mentions \"Globally Licensed & Regulated\" but does not specify any regulatory body or license number.",
