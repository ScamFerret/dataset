There are claims of unusually high and consistent investment returns, which are generally not possible (10% EVERY 24 HOURS). The text also targets human psychological weaknesses by promising easy wealth and fast withdrawals. The company claims to be registered but provides no verifiable information. The contact information includes a phone number that appears to be a personal number rather than a business line. The privacy policy is not mentioned, which is ambiguous for customer information security.",
