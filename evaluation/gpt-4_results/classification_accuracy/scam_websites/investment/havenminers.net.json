It also mentions high-performing investment packages and large numbers of global investors. These could point to characteristic 2 (claims of high, generally not possible amounts of money) and possibly characteristic 3 (targeting psychological weaknesses for investing confidence). Additionally, the contact email provided seems unprofessional for a business, which aligns with characteristic 6.",
