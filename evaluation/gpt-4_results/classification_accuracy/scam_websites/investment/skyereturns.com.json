It also mentions a multi-level referral program which can sometimes be a red flag for pyramid or Ponzi schemes. Additionally, the promise of \"prompt retreats\" with no maximum limits and a very low minimum withdrawal amount could be concerning.

A low Tranco ranking means that the website has relatively few visitors. For a new website this is logical. The same is true for a highly specialized website. However if the website claims to be a large corporate or popular site, than warning flags should be raised.
