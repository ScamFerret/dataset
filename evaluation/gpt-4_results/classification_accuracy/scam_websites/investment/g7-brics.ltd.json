        "thought": "The text extracted from the website contains some red flags that warrant further investigation. Claims like \"Sign up and get your first stock for free\" and \"Earn 17.30% APY on your uninvested cash\" are unusually high returns that might not be possible and target psychological weaknesses. Additionally, the merging of G7 and BRICS into an investment company seems unrealistic, as these are separate political entities and not a single company. The mention of eradicating ponzi schemes also triggers suspicion, as it could be an attempt to appear legitimate by acknowledging common scams.

Tensions are mounting over whether the Brics should be a non-aligned club for the economic interests of developing countries, or a political force that openly challenges the west, said people briefed on India and China’s positions. South African officials said 23 countries are interested in joining.\\n\\n“If we expand Brics to account for a similar portion of world GDP as the G7, then our collective voice in the world will grow stronger,” said one Chinese official, who declined to be identified.\\n\\nNaledi Pandor, South Africa’s foreign minister, said this month it was “extremely wrong” to see a potential Brics expansion as an anti-western move. However, western capitals are likely to regard the possible additions of Iran, Belarus and Venezuela as a move to embrace allies of Russia and China.\\n\\nArgentina, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia are vying to be the first new members since South Africa was invited into the original group of Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2010.\\n\\nPresident Vladimir Putin will not join other Brics leaders in Johannesburg. This will spare Pretoria from having to carry out its legal obligation to arrest the Russian leader after the International Criminal Court indicted him over war in Ukraine.\\n\\nPutin is likely to attend by video link and he spoke to Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi on August 17 about Tehran’s application to join the Brics, according to the Kremlin.\\n\\nXi Jinping will travel to Johannesburg on Monday for the summit and other discussions with African leaders, China’s foreign ministry said, marking a rare trip abroad for the Chinese president this year. Xi’s only other international travel so far in 2023 was to Russia in March.\\xa0\\n\\nBrazil’s President Luiz\\xa0Inácio\\xa0Lula da Silva has recently spoken in favour of opening Brics membership to neighbours Argentina and Venezuela, as well as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\\xa0\\n\\nA senior diplomat in Brasília said it wanted clear conditions established as the basis for any expansion. One could be a requirement for entrants to join the New Development Bank, the Shanghai-based lender founded by the Brics. Saudi Arabia is in talks to become the multilateral bank’s ninth member.\\n\\n“It’s important that criteria are defined for the entrance of these new members,” the diplomat said. It was unlikely that all 23 countries would join at the same time but “they need to know why the decision was taken \\\\[and\\\\] so that, if future expansions happen, the candidates know the priority issues”.\\n\\nOfficials shepherding pre-summit talks have said criteria for admitting new members will have to be agreed by Brics leaders.\\n\\nThey added that a common currency is not on the agenda, despite growing resentment of the US dollar’s dominance among members.\\n\\nInstead of a broader push towards de-dollarisation, the summit could focus on seeking an agreement that Brics members should increasingly settle trade between each other in their local currencies, officials familiar with discussions said.', 'BRICS seems like an organization in search of a goal. It made sense post-2008 with the West taking a bloody nose in the GFC and them more or less all trending in a more liberal direction\\n\\nNow it swings between a forum, and an anti-west pact, to mediation between its members squabbling.\\n\\nI can’t imagine adding more voices will help this except for a photo op of 60 leaders at a conference with Russia and China that the Western press will freak out about', 'If China gets their way and admits all 23 plus whatever number would be needed to rival the GDP of the G7, how does Beijing believe they can bring all those varying interests into a common voice/policy? \\n\\nIf I were a western leader within the G7, I would be quietly hoping China let’s in as many developing nations as they can because that would only serve to weaken the BRICS’ common voice and direction, not strengthen it.', 'The role of India in BRICS is gonna be very interesting. It is no secret that they have bad blood with China because of their Border issues, but an open and wholehearted embrace of the West to just become another Japan or South Korea is probably not what the Indians want. Also Indonesia joining is probably gonna be huge as well, as I can definitely see Indonesia become a Top 10 economy in the world in the next 15-20 years.
