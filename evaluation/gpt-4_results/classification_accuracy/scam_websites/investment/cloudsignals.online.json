It also offers a variety of complex financial products and services, which could be an attempt to appear legitimate. Furthermore, the mention of a nominal debit card from a popular European bank to operate cryptocurrency seems unusual. However, there's no clear evidence of unusually low prices or claims to get an amount of money that is generally not possible from the extracted text alone.
