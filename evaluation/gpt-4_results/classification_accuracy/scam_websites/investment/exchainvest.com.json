        "thought": "The text extracted contains several red flags that are typical of scam websites, such as promises of high returns with low risk, a very high insurance claim amount, and a focus on the safety and profitability of investments. There are also high minimum investment amounts which is unusual. Furthermore, the company claims to be legally registered but does not provide verifiable details. It mentions having a certificate, which should be checked for authenticity. The mention of very high investments made just recently could be a tactic to lure in new investors by showing that others are investing large sums. Let's verify the legitimacy of the company by checking its WHOIS information and looking for any social proof or reports of scams related to this URL.",
