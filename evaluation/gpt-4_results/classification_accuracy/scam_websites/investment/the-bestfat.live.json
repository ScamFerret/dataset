Be aware.*\\n\\nHere is my review of Falcon Trading Guidance (Falcon FX)9 who is owned by Mark Hutchinson22\\n\\nI joined falcon fx11 after reaching out to a few of the key members who were largely active on instagram at the time, all of which said it was the best decision they’d made.\\n\\nA lot were in very similar circumstances to me, and had left IP because it didn’t suit their personalities / styles, whatever you want to call it.\\n\\nI liked the idea of what they were portraying, a simplistic approach to trading, no indicators, just pure price action and trendlines.\\n\\nThis was ideal to me as i’d just come from trying to force myself on complex analysis and complex entry styles.\\n\\nThe main premise of falcons11 teachings is to do with trend trading. This removes a lot of opportunities immediately to trade ranging markets, where typically markets tend to spend more time, instead of trending. Removing trading range-bound markets removes a great deal of opportunity, and from my experience, when you do actually try to apply trending strategies to range bound markets, you get hosed, so even if some are attempting to force these patternistic entries, they’ll have a hard time doing so.\\n\\nBelow is an example of their core teachings, simply put you are learning to recognise patterns and the behaviour of the price action. Simple enough, enter in a corrective pullback pattern, and ride out the huge gain in the impulse stage. Easy as that.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xl2pancm7l141.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=3257943b588de50b52ef77c6b8b932ca72677c4c\\n\\nLike many others, I loved the idea of making these spectacular gains, because everyone loves a carrot dangling in front of them right?\\n\\nThis was great marketing from a business perspective because A) everyone loves simple things to learn, and B) everyone loves a big winner don’t they.\\n\\nThe problem (or genius depending on who’s side your analysing this from) is that teaching pattern recognition is, in and of itself, a never ending task. You will never learn repeated patterns which fall across different asset classes, or instruments, because they all move differently.\\n\\nAdditionally, placing too much emphasis on the very fundamental part of the impulse stage versus the corrective stage will actually mean you end up missing out on so much opportunity. Below is an example of USDCHF.\\n\\nA great impulse down forms, with a lot of corrective nature following it giving falcon11 its bias to short because of the actual nature of the price action. You are taught not to trade against the preferred direction of the price action, in this case to the downside, so you are taught not to take long trades.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztxbpzbo7l141.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=d429f91afe2f1e4e4d14da7df35e301f28964aa2\\n\\nThe above signifies why their teaching is flawed.\\n\\nAs the channel would be forming, falcon11 members will be watching marking on trendlines, and forever ‘evolving’ them as Mark22 puts it, which means once it continues correcting just move the trendlines to reflect current price action.\\n\\nAll red arrows denote failed short attempts within the channel because of the bias only being to the short side. Green arrows denote higher low entries which would’ve been perfectly valid to have gone long from.\\n\\nMy next point to make is the actual execution of the analysis itself. Trading pure price action is what big traders use as their first point of call, however I challenge anybody to find a hedge fund / prop firm / big bank who are trading on pure price action and trendlines without any other indicators or even basic support and resistance.\\n\\nSupport and resistance are not guaranteed areas of turnaround, but they are areas where a lot of traders will be looking. Trendlines are objective and can be drawn a million ways, thus voiding that area of mass psychology.\\n\\nBig traders know who will be looking to aggressively short ‘breakouts’ from trendlines, and they know where you will be doing it. That’s why statistically trendline breakouts often fail 80% of the time.\\n\\nFalcon haven’t found the secret sauce to trading, they’ve found the secret sauce to taking money from mugs basically, and I was one of them.\\n\\nThey dangle the big % return carrot in front of your eyes, showing they ‘made 30% this month’ without a shred of proof, and whenever any members have asked, they’ve either been blocked, removed from slack groups or simply just shunned, much like a cult whenever a doubter speaks up against their leader.\\n\\nNo big trader will take 3 months of sitting on their arse losing 1% here and 1% there trying to get one of these big 30% trades because even though mathematically the risk reward makes sense, they wont be because they’ve got money to make and prop firms would be sacking you if you were making nothing for 3 months because your trendline channel is about to breakout.\\n\\nFrequent smaller wins, in my opinion, are the better alternative.\\n\\nNow, on to the grand master himself, Mark Hutchinson.22\\n\\nThis is the main reason I lost faith in the teachings.\\n\\nFor those who were part of IP in the early days, you will know that Mark22 was infact a student, and actually tried peddling the affiliate links as much as he could (see below photo from July 2016).\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhb2fk0q7l141.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=1962d35a78783eeee15d469b397e6198050c721f\\n\\nBelow here you can see Mark in an **Infinite prosperity** “Ball event” in the **red tie** this is a different trading company which he was a paying member of, which falconFX has copied and called their annual balls.\\n\\n[Mark seen in red tie being a student\\\\/ member](https://preview.redd.it/gpuvqzex7l141.png?width=160&format=png&auto=webp&s=39b059ebd409c6627882d1157342b56abeded6c3)\\n\\n**In the end Mark was a student to a different course/trading scheme and just rebranded their stuff and started his own.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpon looking at Falcons11 main page on their website, it states that ‘between 18 and 22 I worked in Canary Wharf as an investment broker to gain insight and exposure to the financial markets as well as talented proprietary traders, however I didn’t enjoy the lack of freedom that came with working in a high paying normal job’ (another carrot dangling for the students, who doesn’t want to be their own boss? May aswell listen to a Herbalife presentation).\\n\\n‘I have over 8 years experience within the FX market, with the past 4 having been consistently profitable with an average uncompounded return of +117.5% YoY’ that’s bollocks first of all, why would you be learning strategies from IP 2 years ago if you were that profitable.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cehyrd228l141.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=53080b27eb6a38494f647752cdb001d28ab942f5\\n\\nAdditionally, working in Canary Wharf is bollocks, because I remember Mark22 saying in a webinar he worked in an architect (this is backed up by the below news article stating he’d just quit his job in architectural construction)\\n\\nFor those who really do their digging aswell, you’ll find that co-incidentally his mum owns an architectural business which seems suspicious.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tk99q9038l141.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c2c36947a3272d9836ae516774d0a8cabeddd58\\n\\nLast piece of this elaborate money making puzzle is regarding the sudden influx of old IP trading mentors and marketers, all of which have had a sudden change of heart and are not peddling the great money making strategies they once were at IP, they’re peddling the falcon abstract method.\\n\\nThe falcon11 abstract method by the way, is the ability to identify an area there may be some form of turnaround in price, but not to identify any live or in real time, but are able to show a pinpoint entry with almost no draw down, a tiny stop loss and now a huge profit target. Another big orange carrot.\\n\\nI didn’t intend this to be a bashing for IP, however I feel they are intentionally and consciously lying to their students for no other gain than to ensure they continue paying their membership.\\n\\nLike I said earlier, they did teach me one thing, impulse and corrections, and for that I am thankful, but for everything else I think they are intentionally misleading you.\\n\\nI reached out to falcon and gave them the opportunity to settle my concerns, in which case i’d have quite happily backed off, but below is a screenshot of the conversation between myself and falcon.\\n\\n**My email is below:**\\n\\n” Hi Ben,Thanks for getting back to me, please see the following.From May 24th until October 24th i subscribed to the falcon membership because i believed in what was being advertised to myself online. This idea that Mark was an expert in his field and that he had experience to warrant being qualified to teach his craft he specialises in.After 6 months i felt that £97 a month wasn’t providing nearly enough content to warrant the expense, and i’d began to stop believing Mark actually knew what he was talking about.If proof of any trades being placed was provided as evidence to substantiate the claims he’d made 30%+ in certain months then i’d have been more trusting. Unfortunately i chose not to ask when in reality i should have.The community in which I was initially sold on due to its close knit nature, then steadily began to ignore and alienate me, furthering my suspicions that a lot of key members are actually being paid to promote the course. Unfortunately I have been unable to prove this….I believe i am a victim of fraud / a scam and the following points highlight my reasons.\\n\\n**Complaint 1**At no point were any trades taken by Mark actually proved. I.e. a broker statement, live video of metatrader, even a ticket number showing an actual live trade.\\n\\n**Complaint 2**The website is false and can be easily disproved, Mark hasn’t been trading for 8 years, or 9+ as stated on facebook, let alone consistently with his strategy. I have both evidence of previous facebook posts from 2016 showing him trading under infinite prosperity as well as an interview of him in a local newspaper stating he was leaving his job in architectural construction to dedicate time to Silk Bros.\\n\\n**Complaint 3**The website and in the content Mark professes to how he worked in Canary Wharf, this again is false and can be easily disproved with evidence from online.\\n\\n**Complaint 4**Mark has used this community of followers to sell them his goal setting book 3 times, timed well with his purchase of a yacht and 2016 mclaren 540c, again i have my suspicions these are both rented and not even owned.As you can tell from my previous thoughts, i believe that i have been scammed out of my money by using lies and deceit to coax others and myself into a false sense of security.If you can help dispell these concerns then i am happy to leave this where it is and not pursue it further, alternatively a refund of £582.00 is acceptable as this covers the 6 months payments made.I look forward to your response”\\n\\n**Falcon’s response below:**\\n\\n” Hi Tim,As you have raised quite a few different points, I have tried to structure my reply as best as possible.Firstly, you mention that you began to feel alienated and attributed this towards members being paid to promote the course. Falcon does not have any sort of affiliate scheme, nor any type of program which awards students a monetary value. This is the first instance we have heard where a student has found the community to be unhelpful or unwilling to help.\\n\\n**Complaint One – Lack of Proof**You raised the point that you have not seen a broker statement or “proof” of a trade Mark has taken. We would ask that at what benefit would that be to yourself and your trading to see what is the equivalent of someone’s personal statement? The aim of the weekly recurring content isn’t for it to be treated as signals or for the members to copy Marks analysis. The content is designed to teach you how to trade independently.On your social media you have several posts which document the great returns you had experienced whilst trading the Falcon style, whilst also claiming that Falcon was “the last piece of the puzzle” for you. So this doesn’t seem to be in line with your allegation.We would also ask you to refer to our Terms of Service which you agreed to upon signing up, where it states the following in section three:“The material on this site and the Services provided by us are for general information and educational purposes only and should not be relied upon or used as the sole basis for making decisions without consulting primary, more accurate, more complete or more timely sources of information.”Source:Falcon FX - Trading, Simplified.1\\n\\n**Complaint Two – The Website is False**Mark’s background is no secret at all. It is something which he has been very transparent about, including that he had previously been a member of another trading community years back.It would seem that you may have tried to piece together a jigsaw puzzle with a lot of missing pieces. It is also worth noting that it may not be worth your time to cite a newspaper as “evidence”, given that they are notorious for bending the truth and misinforming the public on occasion in order to sell copies.Moreover, we would welcome you to watch an upcoming YouTube video on the Falcon FX YouTube channel, where Mark will discuss his background in further detail and provide some clarity on this which may clear any confusion you have on this topic.\\n\\n**Complaint Three – Working in Canary Wharf**We appreciate that you do not believe Mark worked in Canary Wharf, however we do not intend to provide you Mark’s personal documentation to prove his previous employment history.\\n\\n**Complaint Four – Using The Community as Leverage for Mark’s Book**There has only ever been a handful of books for sale at any one time. The book is promoted via Mark’s Instagram, as well as to the mailing list on Mark’s personal website.Naturally, members of the Falcon community are intrigued to pick up a copy for themselves, however the allegation that the community is being leveraged to sell copies is quite simply outrageous given that Falcon has never marketed the book to Falcon students.\\n\\n**I’m only doing this because genuine, hard working aspiring traders are being misguided by this con artist, who manipulates, misleads and point blank lies to his students, for his own personal gain.**\\n\\nHope anyone found this post useful. This is not my experience but someones I have seen online on babypips but requires some more exposure.\", 'comments': ['I agree, personally. His \"students\" seem more like hype men/women.

Once i saw that it was 97.00 a month i dipped hard. Never gave them my money, luckily. I dont trust ANY schools or programs teaching you how to trade for money.

The  currency trading broker is your connection into the markets and they  will provide the essential cover that allows you to trade with margins.\\n\\nThe  question is how do you select the best Forex brokers. There are at  least 7 criteria points to be considered when you are deciding where  best to shop for a Forex currency trading broker.\\n\\n**1. Dependable**\\n\\nThis  works on multiple levels. You need a broker that you can rely upon to  be trustworthy and who will not all of a sudden vanish like a puff of  smoke from the internet taking with them all of your hard earned money.  The FX market is surprisingly devoid of regulations so there are a vast  number of Forex brokers to choose from and as is like with many things  in life some Forex trading brokers are more honest than others.\\n\\nThe  first step is to check up on the reliability of the currency trading  broker and to confirm your online Forex broker is regulated.\\n\\nCheck for a Forex  currency trading broker with an unblemished record regarding any  complaints logged against them on the National Futures Association  website. Other countries have their own regulatory bodies for example  the Financial Services Authority in the UK performs the same function.\\n\\nAnother  consideration is whether the online Forex broker's trading platform is  reliable. The Forex trading platform is the financial software that will  connect you to the FX markets whenever you want to trade. If the online  Forex trading platform is often offline then this will cause you some  major problems. For example you could miss out on either opening or  closing a trade at the optimum time.\\n\\nIt would be best to check a  number of online Forex trading forums for feedback from individual users  regarding the amount of downtime that they have experienced. Remember  it is like with all online forums do not listen to the loudest voice as  they may have a vested interest either way in recommending or not  recommending who in their opinion are the best Forex brokers\\n\\n**2. Services Provided by the Best Forex Brokers**\\n\\nThe  Forex markets trade for a full 24 hours each day that's from Sunday  evening through to Friday afternoon Eastern Standard Time. Check that  your Forex broker's trading platform is reachable available during all  of these times, The best Forex brokers trading platforms will be  available and they will also offer around the clock customer support on  Forex trading days.\\n\\nCheck that they cover at the seven main  currencies that are USD, JPY, CAD, AUD, CHF, EUR and GBP certainly the  best Forex brokers will.\\n\\nThe best Forex brokers will offer you a  minimum of the following essential tools, which are instant execution of  your Forex trade at the price displayed, technical analysis charts and  financial trading charts. Most will also offer a training program to  teach the basics of using the tools.\\n\\n**3. Forex Broker Costs**\\n\\nOnline  Forex brokers do not make commission charges to their customers so the  way they make their income is from the difference in the Forex trading  spread. The Forex spread is the differences between the buying and  selling prices on any of the currency pairs. The Forex trading spread is  usually any spread between 1 pip and even sometimes less to around 3  pips; this will depend upon the online Forex brokers terms of service  and the currency pair being traded.\\n\\nThe piece of the pie taken by  the spread can make all the difference between achieving a profit or  making a loss in your Forex trading account. This will affect both the  immediate term and also the longer term so you will need to scrutinize  closely at what level the spread will be computed. If you can decide  which pairs you are likely to trade most frequently the spread on those  pairs will be more important to you than on others. For example I prefer  the USD/GBP trading pair, which is known as cable.\\n\\nBeware of  special short term marketing maneuvers like special offers of lower  Forex trading spreads that may not last long once you have committed  your funds.\\n\\nConsideration need to be given on how much is the  minimum amount of capital you can invest in order to open a Forex  trading account. Good advice given to new traders is to start out small,  which means looking for a Forex broker who will let you open an account  with a minimum of $250 or hopefully less.\\n\\n**4. Margins, Which Are Also Known as Deposits**\\n\\nMargins  are a variable that change from Forex broker to Forex broker. A lower  margin requirement means giving you a higher leverage, and higher  leverage can give you the ability to create greater profits, or losses  from a fund of the same size. Margins allow you to magnify the  opportunity to make more money\\n\\n**5. Size of the Trade also known as Lot Size**\\n\\nTrade  size varies from one broker to another. Generally 100,000 trading units  of currency is considered a standard lot, 10,000 of trading units is a  mini lot, and 1,000 trading units is a micro lot. Some brokers do offer  fractions of a lot too, which give you more power to set your own lot  size. This could be perceived as a bonus or just an added complication  depending on your point of view.\\n\\nThere are other matters to be  considered which include the interest paid on the Forex margin account,  the rollover charges when trades continue over to the next trading day  and any other FX trading policies that the broker may have which could  affect your Forex trading account commerciality. These are the main  points that you should be looking out for when choosing the best Forex  trading broker.\\n\\n**6. Customer Service**\\n\\nThis is very important  especially when you have just started out using a Forex trading  platform. Like with all new things there will inevitably be teething  troubles and you will want to be able to speak or email someone and get  an instant response. The best Forex brokers will provide this service.\\n\\n**7. Forex Exit Strategy**\\n\\nThere  will be a time when you want to realize some of the profits that you  have made and be able to withdraw your money quickly and easily. Make  sure that you are able to get your money within a couple of days as some  online Forex brokers insist on a 14 day delay which is totally  unnecessary.\", 'comments': []}]"
