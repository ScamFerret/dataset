The contact information seems inappropriate for business use and the privacy policy is not clearly stated. The payment methods include Perfect Money which is not commonly used by legitimate businesses. The WHOIS information is incomplete which is often the case with scam websites to hide the owner's identity. Additionally the website claims to be a partner of the Bitcoin Foundation which is not verifiable and is a claim often made by scam sites to gain credibility."
