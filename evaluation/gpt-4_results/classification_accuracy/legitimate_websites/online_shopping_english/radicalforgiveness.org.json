It involves acknowledging mistakes without dwelling on them or allowing them to define one's self-worth. Instead of viewing oneself as inherently flawed or unworthy, radical self-forgiveness encourages individuals to embrace their humanity and learn from their experiences. Practices such as mindfulness, self-reflection, and self-compassion are often integral to the process.🥰\\n\\nRadical self-forgiveness also involves recognizing one's innate innocence, understanding that everyone is inherently deserving of compassion and understanding, including oneself. By embracing this perspective, individuals can release the burden of self-blame and judgment, allowing them to cultivate a deeper sense of self-acceptance and inner peace.🌈\\n\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1240732100662250/?ref=share_group_link\", 'comments': ['All forgiveness starts with self forgiveness.
