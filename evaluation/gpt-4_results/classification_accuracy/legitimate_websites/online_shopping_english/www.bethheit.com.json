The domain is registered with Contact Privacy Inc., which is commonly used to protect the privacy of the registrant. There are no red flags in the registration details, and it is updated and not set to expire soon. The name servers also point to Squarespace, a well-known website builder and hosting platform, which adds to the legitimacy of the site. Considering the information from the website content, external search results, and the WHOIS data, there are no indications that bethheit.com is a scam website.
