I have purchased some gel polish on amazon but I don't know what brands are good or how much I should be spending. Some sites price OPI and other gel polish at 25-30$, and I have no idea if it's a complete rip-off (or even real product?) or not.

Zillabeau has some Korean/Japanese brands that are very very good and professional products. Gel is always going to be more expensive than regular polish. $25 for OPI is not a rip off, it is similarly priced to pro beauty supplies like cosmoprof.
