I have started to do my own nails as gel overlays (builder gel, base coat, gel polish, then top coat) but I am struggling with buying polish.

I have purchased some gel polish on amazon but I don't know what brands are good or how much I should be spending. Some sites price OPI and other gel polish at 25-30$, and I have no idea if it's a complete rip-off (or even real product?) or not.

I believe it’s also Hema free but it’s not as clear…', 'Beetles and Kiarasky are good options. For me, OPI is a bit overpriced in their polishes. \\n\\nBeetles sells sets of 5ml bottles with 20 colors or so for less than 40$ and they include two topcoats (one matte) and a base gel too. It’s a good option if you want to try colorful designs :)', 'Nail polish Canada has some good brands like light elegance (which I highly recommend) DND, OPI. Madam Glam is pretty popular. Zillabeau has some Korean/Japanese brands that are very very good and professional products. Gel is always going to be more expensive than regular polish. $25 for OPI is not a rip off, it is similarly priced to pro beauty supplies like cosmoprof.
