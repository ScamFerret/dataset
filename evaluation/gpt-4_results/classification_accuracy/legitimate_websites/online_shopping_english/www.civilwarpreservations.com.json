(Although the brass bits look pretty shiny; have you taken some polish to them?)\\n\\nAs other commentators said, the reason both sides were sharpened near the tip was to help with thrusting (you can see how it comes to a \"spear\" point), like a shashka.\\n\\nWhy your great-great-grandpa had it, of course...no idea.', \"Just to chime in, that sword could be worth a pretty penny, especially since it appears you can provide some decent provenance. I'd recommend making sure that it is properly cared for maintained  if you are not already doing so - even if this is something your family would never consider selling.  (Though, based on the surprising lack of tarnish on the handle and scabbard fittings, it looks like someone might already be caring for the sword).  \\nSome simple things can go a long way. Just keeping a small coat of oil on the blade should be enough to prevent rust from getting established. Where the sword is being stored can be pretty important- avoid storing it in a humid location to protect the steel though storing it somewhere too dry could further degrade the remaining leather. \\nHaving a patina will often make a sword more desirable for collectors, so I would avoid doing any cleaning or restoration without serious consideration. And if you do ever want to restore this sword, is take it to a professional. \\n\\nSorry for the off topic comment, but 19th century military swords are my primary area of interest, and I always think it's a shame when they aren't properly maintained so I feel the need to provide unsolicited advice from time to time.\", 'If your interested in selling it message me :).']}]"
