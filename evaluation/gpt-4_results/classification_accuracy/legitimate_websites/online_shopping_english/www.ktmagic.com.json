There is also a customer complaint on the BBB website, but it is for a different domain (magick.com), not ktmagic.com. The Magic Café forum post seems to provide contact information consistent with the WHOIS data, which could indicate that the domain is involved in legitimate business activities. While the customer complaint on BBB is for a different domain and not directly related to ktmagic.com, it's important to note that the absence of scam reports doesn't necessarily prove the site's legitimacy. However, considering the WHOIS data, the niche nature of the site's content, and the lack of scam reports, there are currently no strong indicators that ktmagic.com is a scam.
