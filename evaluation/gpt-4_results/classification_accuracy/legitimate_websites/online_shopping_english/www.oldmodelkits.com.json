The SS Rex is from the same team that brought you the 1/350 SS Normandie Ocean Liner. This four year project is a 100% new model and represents the Rex in her glory years of the mid 1930s. All design work was done in CAD by Ken Friend, a master modeler, designer and builder of experimental engines and test equipment and an engineer who specialized in CAD/CAM/CAE Systems Management and Implementation.  All of the smaller parts are printed on ultra-high resolution 3D SLA resin printers. These parts meet and often exceed what is possible with injection molded plastic. Only the larger parts (hull, deck pieces and funnels)are cast resin. These are pressure-cast from de-aired molds to minimize air bubbles.  The Italian Line advertised that \"The Southern Route Is the Lido Deck Route.\" By virtue of avoiding the stormy and cold North Atlantic, travelers experienced a true outdoor lifestyle. The Rex was intentionally designed for this. For this model, extensive research and time was spent capturing the exact look of the colorful 1st and 2nd Class Aft Pool Areas- from the changing room & showers, grab rope on the pool, pool slide, stairs & diving boards, tables with umbrellas, recessed (covered) 1st Class Restaurant/Lounge and more.  Because of the superior performance of 3D Printing, over 90% of the usual PE (photoetched) metal parts are now 3D printed resin. This is a vast improvement as they are no longer flat, but are true to the shape of the prototype. This also makes for a nearly complete model \"out-of-the-box.\"  Includes a real wood deck from Scaledecks.  NOTE: railings are the only parts not included with the model shown. They are not required to complete the kit, however 1/350 railings are sold by a vast number of aftermarket sources.  I will refer all buyers to the sources that I believe work the best with the kit. more info > Aurora Lightning P-38 - Famous Fighters of All Nations, 1/48, 99-98 Plastic Model Kit,   Box Condition: Good $125 Rare.  Third issue with rectangular 'Aurora Line' logo and Famous Fighters of All Nations on the box top.  The box has four solid and original corners, no repairs, tags, tag marks or tape (other than the factory sealing tape) but has moderate wear and very light age foxing as shown, hence the grade of 'good.'  Inside, this model is molded in a stunning and beautiful correct gloss medium blue plastic and clear.  It includes the correct early rectangular clear stand and stand arm.  The model has never been started and is inventoried 100% complete with all parts, decals and instructions present.  Even the original factory tissue packing paper is present.  NOTE: the decal were previously stuck to the instructions in several small areas.  The actual transfers are in 'excellent' condition; the damage is to the backing paper only. Monogram US Air Force Refueling Group B-47 And KC-135, 1/240, P409-49 $295 Very rare, one and only issue dated 1960.  When Monogram invested in the tooling for the 18 aircraft \"Air Power\" set, the sales did not meet expectations.  In order to increase revenue from the molds, Monogram issued three separate kits- the \"Refueling Group,\" \"Bomber Group\" and \"Fighter Group\" in the \"Forty Niner\" series with the Tu-16 Badger, F-101 and P-40.  These kits utilized aircraft from the Air Power set with special blue-molded  display stands, unique decals and instructions.  The two aircraft are well molded with recessed panel line detail.  Decals are in amazing 'near mint' condition and the instructions in 'near mint+' condition.  Never started.  Inventoried 100% complete with all parts, decals and instructions present.  NOTE: this kit must be shipped double-boxed for protection. Plant Models Messerschmitt Bf-261 V-2 Adolfine - Ultra-Long Range Aircraft - (Bf261V-2 / Me261 V-2), 1/72, 231 $64 Very high quality kit of the Luftwaffe version of V-2.  The kit features high-definition cast resin parts with fine recessed panel lines, cast white metal main gear struts and tail wheel strut & wheel, very good cockpit & crew stations and high quality vacuformed clear canopies (two) that are in mint condition; perfectly clear and no yellowing.  The kit has never been started.  The parts are all still in the factory sealed bags and includes decals, instructions with aircraft history.   P.1067 was the designation for the design that would fly the Olympic Torch non-stop from Berlin to Tokyo for the 1940 Olympic games.  The specialized, long range monoplane eventually took the name Bf-261 when V1 and V2 were built.  Power was provided by two DB 606A-1/B-1 coupled engines, each of which was a pair of DB601 liquid-cooled mounts driving a very large four bladed propeller.  There was a crew of 5 and bunks were provided.  The work slowed as hostilities picked up.  Without it's intended mission, the 261 was considered for ultra-long range reconnaissance over the Atlantic Ocean, but the difficulty of fixing proper defensive guns caused engineers to give up the project.  The three aircraft were used for performance calibration flights, some of very long range (almost 2,800 miles).  V3 did see action in very long range military reconnaissance.  No further aircraft were built.  The Luftwaffe took all three of the Bf-261s into service with hopes of using them for very long range operations.  V-1 and V-2 were extensively tested and modified for this purpose; their wartime participation is not known, only that both were damaged beyond repair at Lechfeld Airfield and scrapped in 1944 or 45.  It is known that V-3 flew very long range, secret reconnaissance missions to the East and the West while in Luftwaffe colors.  The fate of V-3 is not known. Jo-Han 1956 Plymouth Belvedere Taxi Promo - Short Kit - (Promotional Model), 1/25 $18 Includes the yellow body with 'TAXI' pad printed on the rear doors, green-tinted windshield, two red-tinted clear tail light lenses and chrome plated front & rear bumpers and four wheels/hub caps.  The chrome plating is in 'near mint' condition with only very slight and small flaws.  This is called a 'short kit' because it does not include an interior, steering wheel, rubber tires or axles.  These are from the original Jo-Han molds but are likely reproductions made in the 1990s.  They came with a collection of promo bodies, windshields and chrome parts.  Please note that these are made with a newer plastic that has very good gloss but does not warp.  These are perfect replacements if you wish to restore your warped Plymouth Promo.

Drone Engineering Secret Weapon  - Spectacular Disel Flyer - 38 Inch Wingspan Super Stunt Control Line Model Designed For Diesel Engine Wood Model Kit,   Box Condition: Fair- Very rare and from 1948.  This is a completely prefabricated, balsa and hardwood super-stunt control line design by Leon Shulman.  At that time it was capable of doing every possible maneuver that control line models could perform and some that could not be done, such as a loop and vertical 8's.  It can literally be built in a few hours and features factory cut and carved, high-quality wooden parts, shaped and hollowed leading edges, tapered training edges, hardware, fully formed wire landing gear (or to be used as a take-off trolley that remained on the runway to improve performance), covering tissue and more.  The full size plans include heavily illustrated step-by-step assembly as well as complete flying tips from the famous designer. NOTE: this kit has  'excellent' quality sub assembly as follows:  bellcrank to elevator; upper & lower fuselage and hardwood reinforcements assembled.  Horizontal stabilizer and elevator are very neatly sanded.  There is no other assembly.  The model has been inventoried 100% complete with all parts and paperwork included.  Please note that the covering tissue has bug damage.  In 1948 Drone Diesel also produced and marketed the 'Dronette' Sport Flyer & Stunt Trainer and the 'Hot-Rock,' a National Open Stunt Champion in 1947.  These model, with the 'Secret Weapon,' promoted 'Diesel At Its Best,' the Drone Diesel Engine with a Class B displacement of .297, bore of 21/32 and Stroke of 7/8\".

This was a well-reviewed and fine kit for that time.  It features moving ailerons, elevators and rudder, 'good' cockpit, pilot figure, clear windscreen, rotating wheels & propeller and more.  Molded in the correct gloss dark green and clear & includes the correct large rectangle-based early Aurora stand. Never started.

I have duplicates of some props and some are missing the header. Aurora AT-6 Texan, 1/48, 70-79 $44 Hardbox release dated 1960. This is the harder-to-find issue because it has desirable 'Famous Fighters' in the logo border. The one without 'Famous Fighters' is much more common. This was a nice kit for the time featuring 'good' cockpit detail, pilot and student figures, rotating prop and USAF decals. Molded in silver and clear. The kit has never been started. It has been inventoried complete with all parts and includes decals and instructions.  Please note that the box is only ranked 'good' because there is light brown age spotting on the box top; you can see it best against the yellow areas.

Pyro Brig of War American Privateer, B368-75 Dated 1967 and has great artwork.  This kit represents one of the earliest ships built by Yankee craftsman during the Revolutionary War.

Starting in 1962, all aircraft used by all branches of the US military fit into the same naming system. The prefix letter tells you what the aircraft’s role is (C for cargo, F for fighter, R for recon, etc.), and the numbers are sequential. The F-15 was designed and built before the F-16 but after the F-14. There are a few exceptions to this rule, of course. F-13 was skipped over on account of triskaidekaphobia (there\\'s your $10 word for the day), and sometimes designations are retained when a plane switches roles. The F-35, for instance, was the X-35 during development, but when it entered production as a proper fighter jet, kept the number.\\n\\nHowever, there was one designation that was skipped over for… no apparent reason. In the late 70s, after the F-18 Hornet was developed, the next plane *should* have been the F-19, but instead Northrop (the manufacturers of said airplane) requested they jump straight to F-20. The official line on this was that Northrop wanted to avoid any similarities with the typically odd-numbered Soviet plane designations, but this hadn’t stopped them from accepting the F-17, or later F-23 designations. So what was the deal?\\n\\n#Stealth Jet Mania\\n\\nWell, it just so happened that at the time, the United States Air Force was grappling with a new reality of air combat: radar guided Surface-to-Air missiles. Vehicle mounted, long range, and very deadly, enemy forces could effectively close off any airspace within a few miles of a spot they could park a big truck. This being considered generally unfavorable by American pilots and generals alike, there began a grand effort by the Air Force to invest in what they were calling Stealth Technology. \\n\\nI won’t get into all the details, but essentially by designing planes in certain ways, and using special paints and construction  materials, it’s possible to make it so that an airplane reflects less radar waves than it “should” for an object of a given size. So instead of showing up on radar scans as being airplane-sized, they show up as being bird-sized, or smaller. This is a notable change from previous stealth airplanes, which mainly utilized good old fashioned camouflage, or [flying so high up that no one can see you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_U-2), or [flying so goddamn fast that it doesn’t even matter if they try to shoot us down, because we can outrun their missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird). Unfortunately, radar and missile technology were catching up with those strategies, and so the military decided to start pumping resources into capital S Stealth Tech. Now, as much as they would’ve liked to keep this a secret, there were inevitably some details that slipped out. \\n\\nOne particular event that attracted plenty of media attention was a plane crash that occurred outside Bakersfield, CA in July of 1986. Although local police and firefighters were the first ones on the scene, they were pretty quickly told to get the hell out by a bunch of soldiers that rolled up. The military then closed off the airspace in a six mile radius, surrounded the crash site with armed sentries, and kept many as four or five helicopters in the air, constantly circling the area.\\n\\nNaturally, this attracted the attention of the press who wanted to sneak a peek of the X-files episode happening in real time in front of them. Although the Air Force actually *specifically* denied that it was a crashed stealth fighter, and even salted the site with the remains of an *entirely different* airplane to misdirect anyone who went digging around later, it was pretty clear to everyone watching that SOMETHING was up. The most popular (and of course, most accurate) theory was that it was a crashed stealth jet of some kind.\\n\\nSo, given that F-19 was a “missing” designation, and there seemed to be a secret stealth project the Air Force wouldn’t admit existed, it didn’t take a whole lot to put two and two together and assume that this mysterious F-19 was some kind of highly advanced stealth fighter. \\n\\nNow, I would be remiss to mention that there was *also* a bit of controversy at the time involving military spending on black budget projects. The Carter administration was taking some heat for canceling the B-1 bomber program, and then taking *more* heat for revealing the existence of the B-2 stealth bomber, in what was seen as disclosing defense secrets to score political points, but I’m not here to talk about any of that. \\n\\nNo no, I’m here to talk about a model kit.\\n\\n#The F-19 isn\\'t real. But it *could* be, couldn\\'t it?\\n\\nSee, in 1985, when the public consciousness was fully onboard with “super secret stealth fighter,” the Testor model kit company was looking for a way to pump their sales a little bit. These days, Testor mainly sells paints and craft accessories, but back in the 80s, they were all in on selling kits. And they were pretty good at it, too.\\n\\nNow, I don’t know if you know this, but military model people? They’re batshit insane over getting the details right. I’m talking color-matching paint so that it fits the right shade of blue for Soviet aircraft painted specifically in the summer of a particular year. I’m talking buying dedicated tools for re-scribing rivets on plastic model surfaces. I’m talking carefully hand bending photo-etched brass sheets the size of a grain of rice because the injection-molded parts that come with the kit are slightly out of scale. \\n\\nSeriously. And I love them for it. \\n\\nBut the point I want to drive home here is that military model kit companies *know* this, and they take accuracy pretty seriously. At the time, Testor’s main audience were people like airline pilots and aerospace engineers, and their designers came from the same stock. Models were based on official blueprints of actual aircraft, and they had the industry contacts to ensure their products were accurate. \\n\\nSo, in 1986 when they decided to release a model kit based on the ultra-classified F-19 stealth jet… well, they must’ve had some kind of insider info. Right? Well, sort of.\\n\\n#\"At Least 90% Accurate\"\\n\\nSee, John Andrews, the designer at Testors who came up with the model, was an industry insider. His boss had flown an F-4 Phantom during the Vietnam war. He knew who to talk to, how to access what little public information there was, and was extremely familiar with the technology in less-classified military planes. When his immediate supervisor asked if he could re-create what the F-19 looked like, he was confident he could do it, literally claiming he could come up with one that was “90% accurate” (his words) to the real vehicle, even though no images had ever been released to the public. And the company was so confident in his abilities, in fact, that they held meetings to assess if they were running a risk of revealing secrets to the Soviets. (They determined this was not the case.)\\n\\n[Andrew’s design had swooping curves](https://fantastic-plastic.com/TESTORS%20F-19%20STEALTH%20PAGE.htm), a shape somewhat reminiscent of a rounded-off [SR-71](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/eo/photo/webt/WEBT-SR-71-space.jpg.pc-adaptive.full.medium.jpeg) Blackbird, with inward-tilting tail fins, and no visible jet intakes. It was mysterious and sci-fi looking, but just grounded enough to feel like a real military vehicle. It was also, despite Andrew’s insistence to the contrary, entirely fictional. All the same, Testors put them out for sale, along with the rest of their new products for 1986… and they got more or less ignored in favor of the airplanes that had been featured in *Top Gun* that same year. \\n\\nOr, at least they were ignored right up until a newspaper reporter in Ohio walked into his local model shop and said “hey, what the hell?” That reporter, Tim Gaffney, then went and wrote an article in the Dayton Journal-Herald pointing out how odd it was that Testors was selling a model kit for an airplane that, according to the US Military, Did Not Exist. The Associated Press caught wind, and pretty immediately a whole media frenzy got whipped up around the Testor Corp, the company that was selling a model of a top secret military project. They were in the headlines across the country. CBS sent a film crew to shoot footage of the production lines. They were featured on the evening news with Dan Rather. At one point, US Congressman Ron Wyden stood on the house floor waving the kit in his hand, asking why he was able to buy and assemble a model of a jet that he, a member of the house, wasn’t allowed to see in real life.\\n\\nAnd remember that mysterious plane I mentioned, the one that crashed outside Bakersfield? Well, when the media featured that story, the images that accompanied it were the Testors design. As far as the public was concerned, Andrew’s F-19 ***was*** the stealth jet. Tom Clancy included an F-19 in his book *Red Storm Rising*. [It got its own video game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/347250/F19_Stealth_Fighter/), and then a sequel. Hell, even [G.I. Joe](https://i.imgur.com/PUjGErC.jpeg) and [Transformers](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/File:G1-Zone-toy_Whisper.jpg) got in on the action. And Testors? They were all here for it. The original production run of about a hundred thousand units had to be more than quintupled to around six hundred thousand to meet sales demand. For comparison, in 2019, Revell (another model kit maker) sold a bit more than a million model kits ***total***. The F-19 literally became the best selling model kit *of all time* thanks to the media attention, beating out the then-frontrunner, AMT’s USS Enterprise kit.\\n\\n#So Where Do We Go From Here?\\n\\nTestors had managed to stumble into the holy grail of corporate profits, standing at the fore of a cultural obsession with secret government projects. And there were yet more government secrets left to tap. Next on the list? Project Aurora. \\n\\nAurora was supposedly a hypersonic reconnaissance craft that was designed as a follow up to the grounded SR-71 family of planes. Rumors were fueled by an accidentally released black-project budget labeled “Aurora,” and reports of unexplained sonic booms in California, and a black, delta-shaped airplane in the area around Groom Lake Air Force Base in Nevada. (Yes, *[that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_51#/media/File:Protest_Sign_at_Raid_Area_51.jpg)* Groom Lake AFB). In all likelihood, however, it was not a real plane. “Aurora” was one of several codenames attached to funding for the B-2 Stealth bomber project, and this is in addition to the fact that hypersonic high-altitude recon planes are pretty much outmoded by modern spy satellite tech. Why risk putting a real person in a billion dollar aircraft, when you can get just as high quality images with an unmanned satellite in low orbit?\\n\\nStill, Testor was hoping to trap lighting in a bottle as many times as possible. [So, they made a kit of the Aurora plane](https://modelingmadness.com/review/misc/scifi/sf/paynexr7.htm). And they didn’t stop there, oh no. They had to include [the mothership](https://www.oldmodelkits.com/index.php?detail=44037&erl=Testors-1-72-SR-75-Penetrator-568) that it launched from, as well. And the [Soviet counterpart](https://fantastic-plastic.com/TESTORS%20MIG%2037-B%20FERRETT%20PAGE.htm) to the F-19, of course! And hey, stealth helicopters must be a thing, right? Well here’s [their G.I. Joe-looking ass](https://fantastic-plastic.com/STINGBAT%20LHX%20HELICOPTER%20PAGE.htm) version of what that might look like, I guess. But we’re not done yet, oh no no. In a team-up with UFO conspiracy theorist fan favorite Bob Lazar (I\\'m not making this up), they even produced [a model of a flying saucer](https://fantastic-plastic.com/S-4%20SPORT%20MODEL%20PAGE.htm) that was allegedly an accurate recreation of the *actual* anti-gravity vehicle the military had developed. Still not good enough for you? [Here’s the alien spaceship](https://fantastic-plastic.com/TESTORS%20ROSWELL%20UFO%20PAGE.htm) they based it on that 100% definitely crashed outside Roswell, NM.\\n\\nRemember who I said the target audience for Testors was? You know, engineers and airline pilots. Yeah, that’ll come up again in a second.\\n\\n#The Big Reveal\\n \\nAnd then of course, in 1988 the general public got to learn what the super secret F-19 stealth jet actually looked like… [And it was weird as shit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-117_Nighthawk#/media/File:F-117_Front_View.jpg). A bit like a cross between a collapsed tent and a child’s failed attempt at drawing a jet, the F-117 Nighthawk (as it was actually designated) was not really what anyone was expecting.\\n\\nFirst of all, it shouldn’t really have the F designation, because it’s a ground attack vehicle, but Air Force brass thought they’d attract better pilots by advertising it to them as a fighter jet. And as for the 117 designation, there’s no clear answer. The most likely I’ve seen is that captured Soviet planes were given 11X designations, and because the F-117 was test-flown out of Area 51 along with said Soviet planes, it was given a similar designation, either out of convenience, or possibly to further obfuscate what it really was.\\n\\nSecond of all, it looks like a polygonal bat mated with a broken umbrella. Like, seriously, what the hell. [Look at it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-117_Nighthawk#/media/File:F-117_Nighthawk_Front.jpg). Nothing like the smooth, sweeping curves of Testor’s F-19. The proof of concept platform Have Blue which preceded the F-117 *does* bear a [vague similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Have_Blue#/media/File:DARPA_USAirForce_HaveBlue.png) to the Testors model (note the inward sweeping tail fins), but the model lacked the distinct “rendered on a PS1” vibe that the actual planes possess.\\n\\nSo what happened to the F-19 models? Well, they’re still around. You can still find them on eBay for around $30, if you want. They even come in both 1/48 and 1/72 scales! And of course Testors did later release a model of the real F-117, but the damage had more or less been done to their reputation as Serious Military Model Makers. They’d keep producing model kits of real planes for some time afterwards, but they were less detailed, less accurate, and generally closer to being toys or playsets than scale model kits. Skip forward a few decades to today, and they recently announced they are shuttering their production of model kits entirely, switching their focus to paints, solvents, and accessories.\\n\\nFinally, why is there still no real life F-19? Well, there’s still no good answer. The only official line is the original statement about avoiding similarities to Soviet plane designations. There’s of course rumors that there really *was* (and still is!) a secret stealth jet called the F-19, but that seems somewhat absurd. My guess is that there was someone in the higher ups at Northrop who thought 19 was an ugly or unlucky number, or something.\\n\\n#Toxic Death\\n\\nAs a parting note, I’ll share my favorite little story about the F-117: In 1991, just after the F-117 had been declassified, YF-117 #781 “Scorpion 2” was chosen to be retired to the National Museum of the US Airforce at Wright Patterson AFB. Because it was a pre-production test craft (thus the Y in its designation), it wasn’t gonna be flying with the operational fleet. But before it could go on display, all of the super-secret stealth tech needed to be removed, including the coating of radar-absorbing material. Unfortunately, that stuff is *nasty*. Like, breathe one lungful as it’s being removed and you die of cancer and the black lung at the same time, nasty. On top of that, the sandblasting process didn’t use regular sand, but instead sodium bicarbonate crystals which are *also* incredibly toxic to inhale. Needless to say, everyone who participated in removing the coating was covered head to toe in protective gear, and also hated every second of the work.\\n\\nOnce the plane had been sandblasted and gutted, it was scheduled to fly to Wright-Patterson where it’d be repainted with perfectly ordinary black paint, and parked in the museum. However, that meant that there was a very brief window where it’d be in the air unpainted. The team who did the paint-stripping, not about to let it leave without a sendoff, added a paint scheme of their own, resulting in the [most metal as fuck non-stealthy sky-pirate stealth jet](https://www.thedrive.com/content/archive-images/13668917_10155168127027575_6037669672605916026_oa.jpg?width=1920&quality=70) you’ve ever seen in your life.\\n\\n#UPDATE BONUS ROUND\\n\\n[I bought one and painted it lmao](https://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/comments/u0vwzc/testors_148_f19_stealth_in_toxic_death_paint/)\\n\\n---\\n\\n#Sources:\\n\\n1.
