On top of everything else that happened in the finale, I won’t be able to take it!\\n\\nEdit: spelling', 'comments': ['from a story-telling perspective, having Lorna lose her baby makes the most sense, since they’ve already explored giving a baby up (Daya), and having to watch your kid grow up without you/not being there for the baby (Maria), and it would also let them explore the darker side of Lorna’s mental health issues again, since they’ve pretty much turned it into comic relief lately\\n\\nthat being said, Jenji has been pretty delicate with having the actors do some things they might be uncomfortable with (like having Laverne’s twin brother portray her pre-transition), so i can imagine she’d be reluctant to have Yael do these scenes after just giving birth in real life', \"I think a number of things suggest that she's going to lose the baby. They've made a point of showing how inadequate the medical facility at max is and mentioned paroxetine is one of the meds Lorna is/was taking, plus we've already had one traumatic birth that didn't end badly and two healthy babies--one cared for by the father, the other given up entirely. And all that blood--we saw Daya bleeding too, but nowhere near as much and she was full term.\\n\\nI know Yael just had a child irl, but other shows have had miscarriage/stillbirth storylines when the actresses involved are actually pregnant as well.\", \"There's hope, but since a few characters have had babies throughout the show's run, I feel like they're going to go a different route and have a miscarriage. A part of me thinks they're setting up Lorna and Nicky to be together again, so if Lorna loses the baby, it could drive a wedge between her and Vince, since up until now he hasn't seen the true extent of her mental illness and delusions and a miscarriage would definitely bring them back out. So she'll seek comfort with Nicky, who has truly loved her from the beginning.\", 'I think she’s lose it. It makes sense for the plot and for an arc for her character. When you think about it, since mid-season 3 she’s more or less had everything go her way. Sure, there were some hiccups along the way, but everything *(up until now)* she’s desired has happened. Her losing something that she is serving her sentence to go home to and is basically keeping her sanity, makes for a really interesting story for Lorna in the final season. It opens doors to seeing how she will cope with it, as well as others around her, and shows that maybe there’s an alternative to how her storyline will actually end vs. how we were deceived into thinking it will. Whether that be happily ever after or not.', \"For the miscarriage: We explore a completely new story line versus a recycled one. Yael Stone is a strong enough actress to carry a story where she retreats to that place of massive denial and just loses her grip on reality. It could be a potential award-winning performance.\\n\\nAgainst the miscarriage: Late term miscarriages are extremely rare, even with premature births and complications. It would be even more realistic if the child survived, but has early complications, and she loses her shit because she can't see it. Also, OITNB has been criticized for it's tone the past couple of seasons. There's only so many tragedies viewers can handle.\"]}, {'title': 'The Archaic Epidemic - The Pale Door.
