The domain status prohibitions (clientTransferProhibited, clientUpdateProhibited, clientRenewProhibited, clientDeleteProhibited) are typical for domains to prevent unauthorized transfers or deletions. The domain has been recently updated, which is a good sign. However, the use of a privacy service is not unusual and does not necessarily indicate a fraudulent site.
