Ecology Works for this allergy family...makes life so much better! Thank you!! Linda – Online Customer Their products and services are outstanding. This stuff has saved my life. I spray my entire house (rugs), and within a month or two my allergies were basically non-existent. I have been ordering the laundry detergent from Ecology Works for years and find it to be an excellent product. Vital Oxide is my FAVORITE but I also love many other products from Ecology Works. What more can I say?? Customer service was excellent ----delivered as promised and product was very satisfactory Very good laundry detergent, yet gentle on the skin. I was diagnosed with having an allergy to potassium dichromate which is in most laundry products. This product does not have it. I have been using this product for about 5 years, and have had no more allergic reactions due to sleeping on sheets & pillow cases that have been washed in other detergents. I am so thankful for this great product! Bonnie - Online Customer Get on the list. Sign up to receive our newsletter and exclusive offers. Subscribe © Copyright 2024 Made with ♥.
