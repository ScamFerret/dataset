However, I do not have sufficient evidence to confirm it as a scam based on the characteristics provided, as the prices were not analyzed, the claims about getting money were not found, no psychological targeting was identified, and the payment methods were not checked. To complete the analysis, I should attempt to verify the prices and payment methods. However, due to the limitations of this environment, I cannot directly analyze the pricing or payment methods. With the tools at my disposal and the checks I've made, there is no concrete evidence to label the website as a scam. The website could potentially be legitimate, considering the long-standing domain registration and security measures in place. However, without being able to analyze the prices and payment methods, I cannot make a definitive conclusion.
