I was originally introduced to the product by a door to door salesman and have reordered from their website three times. I love this product. It replaced almost every other cleaner I used to buy. My mom and sister will actually come over to make up their bottles from my concentrate. Would recommend it without reservation. Ellie S. I Love it! Quite honestly I was a little leery about buying your product at first because it was door to door sales, but after your salesman demonstrated it there was no question that it could do exceptional things! I Love it! I use it exclusively for laundry problems, carpet stains, the tar and road stuff on our cars. I had to make up two spray bottles because my son kept taking my bottle from the laundry room to the garage. I also like the fact that it is so safe to use. Ashley Pro-Tek works the best. Pro-tek Works the Best! As a serious wood worker, my saws accumulate much pitch. I have used many solutions to keep them clean, but Pro-Tek works the best. I also have a cat that has forgotten what a litter box is for and Pro-Tek sure comes in handy cleaning up after him. I am going to try Pro-Tek on my car as soon as the weather permits. Brian I absolutely love your product. I absolutely love your product. It removes grease, oil and grass stains that get on my clothes at work. I also use it to remove fingerprints from walls, etc. It was great to be able to save money by ordering a gallon jug. My husband even took it to work to clean his restaurant. I love it! I love to use it on counters and the stove, especially stuff that’s been stuck on. It’s great for the microwave! My husband even took it to work to clean his restaurant. It’s been able to get rid of stains that nothing else has. Versatile! Your product is very versatile and useful. It’s been able to get rid of stains that nothing else has. I appreciate its easiness to apply. And it is so safe to use. Thank you. Best cleaner I’ve ever used and love the smell! I’ve been using Pro-Tek for over 5 years. Carpet stains, car clean-up, and kid art (white couch, green marker) has nothing on Pro-Tek. Love the products and will continue using! My dad, who cleans a church, loved the cleaner so much he uses it on the job. Best cleaner I’ve ever used and love the smell! I also use the Clean-Zyme for pet stains, works wonders! Kimberly I am one HAPPY consumer and will continue to buy their GREAT product for years to come. I have been using Pro-Tek for years now. I love it and will not buy any other cleaners of this type. It does so much so well! I am one HAPPY consumer and will continue to buy their GREAT product for years to come. I have told my family and friends how great Pro-Tek is, many strangers have been informed by me also. I feel like I am doing them a favor, not selling a product. Thank you so much Pro-Tek for doing business in this manner! Impressed! Impressed! Thank you for your promptness. I received my last order in just a few days. I am so impressed with your cleaner.
