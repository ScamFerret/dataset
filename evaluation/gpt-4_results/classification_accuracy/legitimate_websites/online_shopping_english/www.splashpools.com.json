Putting aside expectations though, Paper Mario: Color Splash is a decidedly solid adventure-platformer, with some great storytelling and humor layered on top. The papercraft visuals are gorgeous, and the soundtrack will have you humming along in just a few minutes. The card-based battle system is a real downer though and the loss of deeper gameplay elements is still hard felt, dragging the whole experience down quite a bit.\\n\\n_____\\n[Cheat Code Central](http://www.cheatcc.com/wiiu/rev/papermariocolorsplashreview.html) - 4/5\\n>Paper Mario: Color Splash has a lot going for it. Most of the time, it\\'s the kind of game that simply brings a smile to your face as you enjoy the fresh world and amusing dialogue. If it weren\\'t for the tedious side effects of the card system and the disappointingly unoriginal cast, it could be a genuine Game of the Year award contender. As it is, it\\'s still thoroughly worthwhile for its enchanting paper world (and the attendant tunes) alone. This game is about 80% whimsy, wonder, and silly grins – which makes it worth your while to put up with the few ways that it doesn\\'t shine.\\n\\n____\\n[Destructoid](https://www.destructoid.com/review-paper-mario-color-splash-390128.phtml) - 8.5/10\\n>But that\\'s it. That\\'s the extent of my issues with this game, and for me, the positives far, far outweigh the negatives. If you didn\\'t like Paper Mario: Sticker Star because it wasn\\'t like the first two games in the series, I don\\'t think you\\'ll be satisfied here. For everyone else willing to give it a chance, Paper Mario: Color Splash is a charming journey that will delight your senses, your funny bone, and the part of your brain that houses your nostalgic feelings towards Nintendo.\\n\\n____\\n[Digital Chumps](http://digitalchumps.com/game-reviews/159-nintendo-wii-u/paper-mario-color-splash.html) - 8.4/10\\n>It’s no Thousand-Year Door, but Color Splash really does provide an overarching sense of consonance which was conspicuously absent from Sticker Star and even Super Paper Mario. It’s a good balance of humor, environment, variety, and casual puzzle elements. And it seems likely that, provided they can sit back and relax and reset their expectations for the franchise, the fanbase will really enjoy what it brings to the table.\\n\\n_____\\n[DualShockers](http://www.dualshockers.com/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review-a-colorful-display/) - 8.5/10\\n>Paper Mario: Color Splash is a hell of a good time. If you are able to look past a gimmicky battle system and a couple of shoehorned mechanics, Color Splash oozes with both charm and humor. Sporting a great aesthetic, it is a title that should be in every Wii U owner’s library.\\n\\n_____\\n[EGM](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/paper-mario-color-splash-review/) - 8.0/10\\n>Color Splash presents a beautifully crafted paper and cardboard world, populated by witty paper Toads and existential minions. Though it’s got its share of backtracking and battle system quirks, the new painting mechanics are satisfying, and the mini-story arcs are almost creative and clever enough to make you forget that your princess is (yet again) in another castle.\\n\\n____\\n[Gamespot](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-color-splash-review/1900-6416536/) - 7/10\\n>At its most imaginative, Color Splash\\'s visual gags and thoughtful manipulation of 2D objects rival any \"wow\" moment from Sony\\'s Tearaway games. What Color Splash lacks in moment-to-moment paper tricks, it more than makes up for in persistent visual appeal and a wholly adorable cast, including antagonists from all pay grades.\\nIts only frustrating feature is its Cutout interface, which can leave one stumped, disrupting the game\\'s pacing and enjoyment of levels considerably. The novelty of the paint splashing doesn\\'t grow tiresome, but it does take a backseat to the visual allure for which the series is known. Color Splash makes a solid case for a Paper Mario sequel that doesn’t need to rely on shtick like stickers or paint, though I won\\'t be surprised if Nintendo’s considering using crayons in the future.\\n\\n____\\n[GamesRadar+](http://www.gamesradar.com/paper-mario-color-splash-review-every-niggling-issue-is-followed-by-a-moment-of-grin-inducing-silliness/) - 3.5/5\\n>They say the devil’s in the detail, but Color Splash proves quite the opposite. In the minutiae it excels, while many of its broader systems hit a little wide of the mark. Despite its flaws, it’s very difficult to dislike, perhaps because every niggling issue is quickly followed by a moment of grin-inducing silliness or awe-inspiring beauty. This might not be the return to classic Paper Mario that its devotees have been awaiting, nor is it a bold reinvention that vindicates Nintendo’s need to innovate. It is, however, one of the most heartwarming games you’ll play this year.\\n\\n_____\\n[Game Informer](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/paper_mario_color_splash/b/wii_u/archive/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-game-informer-review.aspx) - 8.5/10\\n>Color Splash’s RPG elements might be paper thin, but fans of the series won’t be disappointed with this latest adventure. While the game’s combat isn’t much deeper than Mario’s paper-thin body, this plumber’s antics and colorful world are worth the price of admission.\\n\\n_____\\n[God Is A Geek](http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/paper-mario-color-splash-review/) - 8.5/10\\n>Colour Splash is just another in a long line of great exclusive games for Nintendo’s beleaguered Wii U system, which will soon be replaced by the upcoming NX. It won’t be played by as many people as it should, and that’s sad. It’s not going to be a system selling title, but Wii U owners owe it to themselves and to Nintendo to play this.\\n\\n_____\\n[IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review) - 7.3/10\\n>Paper Mario: Color Splash is a step in the right direction for the series after the 3DS’s Paper Mario: Sticker Star, continuing its shift from RPG to action-adventure game while also introducing some smart changes to its battle system. The beautiful Wii U graphics and playful humor stay true to the spirit of the Paper Mario franchise, but the story is straightforward and a bit bland. Inventive level design in the second act offers some much needed diversity to some of Color Splash\\'s otherwise linear gameplay before the disappointing third act regresses into simple and uninteresting battles. Though Color Splash still isn\\'t back to the high points of the first three games in the Paper Mario series, it\\'s a strong step in the right direction.\\n\\n_____\\n[Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/paper-mario-color-splash-the-kotaku-review-1787439292)\\n>Color Splash is so damned imaginative and beautiful, though, so colorful and confidently funny. Even when it annoyed me, it was only fleetingly. It makes the abstract world of Mario so personable. Its gentle, playful weirdness and irreverence contrast so positively with the prevailing seriousness of fall’s big games.\\n\\n______\\n[Lazygamer](http://www.lazygamer.net/review/paper-mario-color-splash-review-paint-and-gain/) - 7.5/10\\n>Without the drive to engage in combat, or complete side missions, I found myself purely driven by the natural progression. I enjoyed seeing new levels and unique references. I loved the way the music was tied into the experience, and I felt so strangely satisfied by colouring in all the missing spots in levels. With hours of gameplay and no two levels the same, I certainly enjoyed myself with Paper Mario: Color Splash. Just don’t expect it to play as a Mario RPG or along classical Paper Mario lines.\\n\\n_____\\n[NintendoWorldReport](http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/43515/paper-mario-color-splash-wii-u-review) - 9/10\\n>I wasn’t expecting to be so surprised by Color Splash, and it’s turned out to be one of my favorite games this year. Color Splash is a gorgeous, funny, and entertaining adventure that functions as a wonderful swan song for the Wii U. There’s a lot of content and fun to experience here, and Wii U owners owe it to themselves to give this game a chance. It’s not a direct sequel to Thousand Year Door, but it doesn’t need to be. Color Splash is a fantastic game in its own right, and deserves to be played by everyone.\\n\\n_____\\n[TheSixthAxis](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review/) - 7/10\\n>Paper Mario: Color Splash is a wonderfully realised game with plenty of humour to keep you smiling throughout. However, it’s hampered by some annoying design decisions and carries the legacy of Sticker Star – both good and bad – which many series’ fans may find problematic.\\n\\n_____\\n[TrustedReviews](http://www.trustedreviews.com/paper-mario-color-splash-review) - 4/5\\n>It won’t do much for those crying out for a proper Mario adventure on Wii U, but Paper Mario: Color Splash is a lively cocktail of Mario, RPG and papercraft puzzle-solving with funny dialogue and a surreal, self-aware sense of humour. It won’t be for everyone, but it’s a great game for those who get its lovable oddball vibe.\\n\\n_____\\n[USgamer](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/paper-mario-color-splash-wii-u-review-flinging-hue-throwing-shade) - 3.5/5\\n>Make no mistake: Some of Color Splash is best-in-class material.
