Unreal\\n\\nFun Blood Farm anecdote-- (NSFW)\\n\\nBack when my pal n I were in our mid teens, we graduated from fishing inshore saltwater fish to pursue offshore targets. Our first goal involved sharks: Blue dogs, Porbeagles. Threshers\\n\\nWe had absolutely no clue –none– what we were doing. So we guessed and put together the most appalling chum mix ever in a 55gal trash can.. to ladel out over Jeffreys Ledge. In addition to 25# flats of rotten herring, and decaying fish carcasses..we added 5 **gallons** of cow blood from the Blood Farm in Groton. It might've been the most disgusting and disturbing thing I've ever seen. \\n\\nSecond time we went for sharks.. we duplicated the recipe. But this time the Blood Farm didn't have it ready for us. So we followed the workers inside for a fresh tap.\\n\\nAbsolute madness. \\n\\nHeading into the slaughterzone, we dodged and jumped around swinging lamb carcasses in a narrow walkway; they were being butchered by min wage workers who were recent Jamaican immigrants. \\n\\nOnce inside, the bleeding commenced. \\n\\nRight in front of us, a cow was powertapped to the domepiece. Holy fuck. Then it was quickly raised up on chains, the throat slashed, and a 5G bucket placed beneath the faucet of foamy blood that poured out.\\n\\nIIRC, 5G cost 20 bucks.\\n\\nThe scene was so outrageous, my pal & I said ok..that's enough. Nix the cow blood from chum.\\n\\n--Turns out we never needed it anyway. \\n\\nAs we polished our offshore skills, we quickly learned(in like a month)that land-based mammal blood is entirely foreign to sharks. They 100% prefer fish oil, fish juice, and pulverized fish bits for chum. \\n\\nNowadays.. my old pal & I work for tuna in the summer. We do everything we can *not* to attract sharks..and curse Senior Neptune when one happens to strike our live bait sets for tuna. \\n/Fin\", \"I'd look for a slaughterhouse.
