Lifekind's products are incomaprable with any other organic. healthy home items out there. We have been long term customers and will continue to remain loyal due to the unparalleled quality of the products and the customer service, specifically Kyra! She has taken care of me and my family members and we all live and sleep better due to her and Lifekind products. I cannot give higher praise! Joyce G. Sleeping in Peace I believe LifeKind pillows/products are worth every penny.  Given the world in which we live and the absurd amount of toxic chemicals that are put into our textiles, LifeKind gives you an alternative option where you can rest assured that you are not breathing nor absorbing through your skin toxins that are harmful to your health.  Thank you LifeKind!! Pamela H. Beautiful nursing pillow So happy to present this nursing pillow to our natural life loving friends. I had always gotten the brand of nursing pillow I learned about years ago, but this one is so much better in every way! This will be my new standard baby gift. Thank you Renee S. 03/16/2024 Organic Towels I love how soft the organic towels are! Chrisanne N. Most comfortable pillow top ever. I just received the wooly pillow top. It’s so luxurious - soft, puffy, well made. Like sleeping on a cloud but with more support. Bryn Still trying to get use to a spray deodorant. Shawn 02/02/2024 Crystallite Deodorant Spray The best shampoo that gives you tons of volume! Rejuvenating Shampoo with MSM pillow top So glad we ordered the pillow top!! it relieves pressure points and sleep has definitely improved for both of us! Stanley B. 01/27/2024 Excellent quality! We are so grateful to LifeKind for the excellent quality of your organic mattresses, blankets, pillows, mattress protectors and sheets. We have been purchasing our bedding from LifeKind for the past ten years. It is reassuring to know that our bedding is chemical free, and at the same time beautifully made. Thank you, LifeKind for your fine products and your friendly, reliable and professional customer service. Barbara B. Sublime comfort ... From my beautifully supportive box-spring foundation, to my luxury cotton sheets and soft, soft, soft weighted blanket - to even my shampoos and conditioners - nothing I have purchased here at LifeKind has been anything but sublime. My box-spring foundation is built so well that an elephant could sleep on it and it wouldn't make a dent. My sheets, combined with my weighted blanket, are so soft and comfortable that I sleep better - and longer - than I have in years. And the shampoo + conditioner? My hair is so pretty, smooth and soft that I can't stop running my hands through it after it's washed. To be honest, if I ever need any other bedding or another box-spring foundation? I'll not shop anywhere else - because yes - I love what I've purchased that much! Nicole 01/08/2024 Soft, organic, perfect! Our home is outfitted with bedding from lifekind. The cotton sheets and duvet covers are buttery soft and the quality is great. I shopped another brand when bedding was sold out here and that other company's sheets were not nearly as soft and lovely. Customer service has been fantastic too when I've reached out with questions. A. Softest sheets These are the softest organic sheets I have ever used!  I'm very happy to have found them. Lynne T. Traditional with 2” soft latex topper We bought our first latex mattress from Lifekind 15? years ago. Allise great teddy bears I love the organic teddy bears from lifekind.
