Microwaving vs. Traditional Brewing Methods The debate is endless- do you throw a tea bag into some water and nuke it in the microwave or heat up water on the stove or in a water warmer/boiler?

Oxidation- What is it and what does it have to do with tea? It can be seen when certain fruits and vegetables turn brown after having been cut open.

Darjeeling Tea from the Himalayas Darjeeling teas which are regarded as the 'Champagne' of teas, are normally classified as a type of black tea, but the degree of oxidation, particularly at the start of the season is below 100%.

TESTIMONIALS Genevieve, Tea Punk Teas The tea is great. As always, you have been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to answer my question. Your excellent help and advice is one of the many reasons (including fantastic teas) that we will continue to be loyal customers. Chris Frost What a great little shop!  Who would have ever thought that tucked away in central Indiana is a tea blender with clients all over the world?  It's a rather unassuming store front, but inside, you will find a bewildering array of teas from all over the world.  This isn't your typical stuff from the grocery store.  Most of it is blended there, in the shop.  There is also a nice variety of steeping vessels.  I've been quite pleased with the blends I've tried so far, and look forward to trying more.  I'm particularly eager to watch the flowering tea.  Their website also has a very helpful series of videos that will walk you through the steeping process, explaining proper water temperature and steeping times for each type of leaf.  Very cool stuff that will serve to enhance the experience. Marlen, Customer It has an excellent customer service. It is a great place, with lots of tea varieties! I highly recommend it. Thank you! Linda, Customer Love your Tea can’t wait for my order to arrive today and ready to order the newest teas …you asked for tea recommendations. Everything Empire Tea Service makes is amazing.
