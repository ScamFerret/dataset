Look at some of the ‘users’ spamming tens of comments.\\n\\nTo think that some unregulated, untested, crazily overpriced supplement is better or simpler than buying baby spinach, lettuce and broccoli is crazy.', \"I recently went through quite the experience trying to upgrade my health routine, hoping it might resonate with or even help some of you.\\n\\nI got on the AG1 train a while back, drawn in by all the rave reviews and the impressive list of ingredients it boasted. Every morning, mixing that green powder into my shake became a ritual I looked forward to, thinking of all the goodness I was fueling my body with. The whole idea of getting such a wide range of nutrients in one go felt like exactly what I needed.\\n\\nBut as the weeks rolled by, I started feeling a bit lost in the promises versus the reality. It wasn't that AG1 was bad, per se; it just didn't seem to deliver the noticeable changes I was hoping for, especially considering the cost. I also found myself squinting at the label, trying to figure out exactly what and how much of each ingredient I was taking, this info seems to be missing from my pack at least which left me feeling more out of the loop than I'd like to admit.\\n\\nAnd then there's the cost. AG1 isn't cheap, and I was okay with that at first, thinking of it as an investment in my health. But without seeing the clear benefits I was after, the price started to sting a bit more each time I reached the bottom of the bag.\\n\\nSo, I decided to switch things up and give [Supergreen Tonik](https://nutritiou.com/product/supergreen-tonik-2/) a try, mainly because I read about its focus on mental clarity and the straightforward way explain their ingredients, which are actually shown on the pack too! And honestly, it felt like a breath of fresh air. Knowing exactly what I was consuming each day made me feel more in control of my health choices. Plus, the cost, while still an investment, started to feel more justified as I began noticing the benefits.\\n\\nThe changes weren't overnight, but they were significant enough for me to take notice. My energy levels felt more consistent throughout the day, my digestion's better and my focus during work improved. It was like my mental fog started to clear up, and I found myself powering through tasks that would usually have me dragging my feet. It's been pretty stressy at work recently, but I've managed to stay on top of everything without the usual anxiety, which was a pretty big win for me, I think SGT has helped with that.\\n\\nTake care,\\n\\nJobi\", 'TL;DR = Eat more fruit and vegetables & podcasters like Huberman and Joe Rogan are making bank pimping a $100 pouch of vitamin powder', 'He did the simple math and it’s under dosed.

I don’t have the acumen to know what I’m looking at? What’s the angst? And it becomes the things we see right in front of us, man. All I can say is, 75 million people voted for Trump. That’s all I can say. You ain’t fooling me. I know what it’s about, a lot of you hate everything we did when we came here about the staff, the diversity of the staff, it was this or that. And I like to think I know a little something about building teams and what organizations should look like. I’ve worked and played for some of the best organizations.” \\n\\nI wouldn’t interpret that as saying all Vandy fans are Trump supporters at all.
