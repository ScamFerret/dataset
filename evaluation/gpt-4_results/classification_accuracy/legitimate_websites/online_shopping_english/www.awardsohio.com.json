This is a strong indicator of a legitimate operation, as scammers typically do not have access to these payment processing options. Given the information available so far, the website does not exhibit clear characteristics of a scam. It has a social media presence, offers customer service contacts, lists a physical address, and accepts common, secure payment methods. Although I have not been able to retrieve detailed WHOIS data, no immediate red flags have been raised through the content analysis or social media searches.
