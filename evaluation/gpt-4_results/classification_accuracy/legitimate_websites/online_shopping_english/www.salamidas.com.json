As a traveling man, I get to experience many of life\\'s unique cuisines. I will be going to Spain next year and plan on doing one of these for sure! I\\'m always finding new and unique foods, and I usually can\\'t say I\\'m disappointed. I will say, I\\'m just starting my more exotic travels, so some of those other worldly cuisines may have to wait, so for now, I\\'m just going to to post some pictures of foods that could be EIYI ideas, if they so dare.  \\n\\n\\nHowever, my first choice is actually my home of 37 years, Upstate NY. So here\\'s the menu, ladies and gentlemen.  \\n\\n\\n[1. Buffalo, NY - The Buffalo Wing. These delicious appetizers \\\\(that let\\'s be serious, are never an appetizer\\\\), were first started in the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, NY, which now operates in several states! While the sauces and textures have evolved over time, this is the true blue original. Funny enough, before this discovery, the wing part of chicken was considered \\\\\\\\\"worthless.\\\\\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/pr7s76yl8kjb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0aa5afb55464e24a15777785508b49001dc9c834)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[2. Syracuse, NY - The Hoffman\\'s Snappy Griller, aka the White Hot, came about more than 140 years ago to Syracuse via Frank Hoffman, a German native. In the olden days, these were delivered via a wagon, and then transitioned to an old fashioned meat market, much like a butcher shop. It has that element of spice kick when you first bite in, and is typically served with dijon mustard, though I prefer mine with yellow mustard and sauerkraut.](https://preview.redd.it/tdrozmdk9kjb1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b31d2510b422df62f926d93efb67ad7fb502ec64)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[3. Binghamton, NY - Chicken Spiedie. Rob Salamida invented this simple sauce for his chicken hoagie when he was just 16 years old. He was so convinced, that he sought to obtain a booth at the nearby New York State fair, thus becoming the youngest person ever to hold a booth at the fair. The sauce has an extreme garlic profile, which the chicken marinates in overnight.](https://preview.redd.it/5kipsiktakjb1.jpg?width=1517&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e59ef1b43ca41b4af8eee443f857ff95f1cf040)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[4. Saratoga Springs, NY\\\\/ Albany, NY - Stewart\\'s Root Beer Float. So, this one may be controversial, because technically, this started in Mansfield, Ohio, but it didn\\'t really take off until it reach upstate NY. You may have seen these bottle root beers in your local grocery store, but it is actually also an ice cream chain! If your are ever in Albany, NY or nearby, you are sure to see quite a few of these. What\\'s unique about this ice cream is that the milk and eggs used to make their products are all locally sourced, 15 minutes from the headquarters, which probably explains why only their sodas made it to the rest of the USA. ](https://preview.redd.it/64zcgmanbkjb1.jpg?width=530&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28dbfad8956a49fdbf0fee852c1ee1dc60b29395)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[5. Rochester, NY - The Garbage Plate.  I mean, this dish is basically the origin story for EIYI.  In Rochester’s late 19th-century industrial heyday, the Garbage Plate was born out of necessity to a Greek immigrant, Alexander Tahou, who founded the restaurant in 1918 as West Main Texas Hots, naming it for one of the two main ingredients: “hots” and potatoes. The white hot is a pale, unsmoked sausage mainly found in these parts and other chilly Midwestern cities populated by German immigrants; the red hot is of similar origins, and its name doesn\\'t refer to its level of spice, but distinguishes it by its ruddy color. At Tahou’s, the hots in question have long been made by the Rochester meat\\\\/sausage maker Zweigle\\'s, which opened its doors in 1880. The hots and potatoes were cheap eats that aided hunger during the Great Depression. HOWEVER, the rumor amongst those not in Rochester in more modern times,  Garbage plates is that that they were developed by hungry, and possibly really drunk, college students from the University of Rochester.The just wanted a plate of food and basically had the workers at Nick Tahou Hots piled all the leftovers odds and ends onto a plate.   A Garbage Plate is a loaded dish of crispy home fries, hot sauce, macaroni salad and cheeseburgers topped with raw onions, condiments and slices of white bread. Sometimes you’ll see it with hot dogs \\\\(red hots\\\\) or even white veal hot dogs \\\\(white hots\\\\). ](https://preview.redd.it/thoczm7kckjb1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35b74154687a22b735b7323134fe9578f7e7c846)\\n\\nNext Menu post will be from: my current travel city, Houston! stay tuned!', 'comments': []}, {'title': '[FP] sans picture.
