What a priceless keepsake it has already become. I get compliments from everyone who sees it. It is so beautifully crafted and not like the many flimsy charms out there today. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.” ” I just received the charm today and had to write. It is even more gorgeous than I had anticipated. I have not seen anything on the market to compare with its weight and beauty. I cannot wait until my baby is born so I can have the birth date engraved on the back. I will never own another piece of jewelry that will ever mean more to me than this pendant. Thank you so much for designing it!” “Late in the evening, I placed an order for a beautiful pendant. At the same time, I called you and requested that you send it out to me as quickly as possible, because my wife was due very soon.  The assistance and patience that I witnessed that evening were second to none. I was assured that I would receive my pendant on time, and I did. ” Our dearest friends in the world recently lost their beautiful 2-year-old daughter to cancer. We didn’t know how to help them, as there were no words to express the deep grief we were experiencing along with them. We came across your “My Baby Angel” charm while searching online one evening and knew as soon as we saw it that we wanted one for our friends. We just want you to know that it brought bittersweet tears to them. The mother has not taken it off since we gave it to her and she often holds and rubs it while wearing it and feels that her daughter is being held her heart. Thank you for making such a comforting design for parents who experience the greatest loss of all.” Designed From The Heart… “A design as pure and distinct as a “baby in a heart” is the embodiment of motherhood…” Recent Posts Hi April…Time for Birds to Sing!
