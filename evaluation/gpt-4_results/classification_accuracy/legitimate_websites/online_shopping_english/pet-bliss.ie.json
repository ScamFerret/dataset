Feel free to add advice in comments, this is just my experience!**\\n\\nWent quiet after three years of checking this sub as I realised I wasn\\'t getting much better and hated sounding a broken record, felt I had lost my twenties, and today I\\'m back to say hello, ask whether other people are approaching 4 years too, and to give the hopeful news that I think I might be finally improving. Hoorah!\\n\\nWithout getting too sentimental guys ....... When it was really bad, I used to read recovery posts on here and assured myself that I would write one some day. Hope this post can serve a similar purpose for someone else.\\n\\nNot fully better yet at all ***but***, I am no longer flaring every day, and haven\\'t been bedbound for a couple of months. Living a very happy life, happier than pre-covid, and though I am still not 100% recovered - I call this a win. *If you have the burning skin symptom, PLEASE MESSAGE ME, as it\\'s the main thing still cropping up and I\\'d love to compare notes!*\\n\\n# Symptoms comparison\\n\\n**This time last year:**\\n\\n* **sleeping \\\\~16 hours a day**, partner would leave for work in morning, come back at lunch and find me still asleep from the night before\\n* **extreme sensitivity to touch** / hypersensitivity of skin - **burning sensation** all over body (this is my \\'main\\' symptom and most debilitating. Especially rubbish as no hugs4me during a flare)\\n* **sleeping sat up** some nights else I\\'d not be able to breathe,\\n* **vomiting** from how difficult breathing was, chest pressure extreme,\\n* picking up month **long secondary infections** all the time, common cold would last four weeks,\\n* having **constant blackouts**, dizziness, (now realise this was POTS),\\n* **coughing up blood** from secondary infections hitting me way harder than normal,\\n* **muscle pain and fatigue** after exertion, could not walk some days,\\n* constant **stabbing chest pains**,\\n* **electric shocks** down my arms and legs and stomach,\\n* **cognitive** issues and general depression from the pain,\\n\\n>Note: used to be SO reluctant to mention these ones to doctors (let alone admit it to myself), as a big fear at the start was not being believed and not being percieved as having \\'a positive mindset\\', so wanted to seem like a trooper by only mentioning the... easier to prove (?) symptoms - I did not want anyone thinking I had a self defeating mindset, or whatever other bollocks the world was insinuating, when this was all new, and I also knew medical misogyny wouldn\\'t be in my favour with things like low mood and feeling confused or stupid. My biggest regret is downplaying my symptoms. People either are or aren\\'t going to judge you and believe you. Give the full picture.\\n\\n* **confusion**\\n* speech **slurring**\\n* **blanking** on words\\n* **memory** problems\\n* acting **drunk** when not drunk\\n* **simple** tasks feeling **complex**\\n* **health anxiety** increased with time\\n* **depression** during high pain periods, sometimes suicidal thoughts\\n* dependent on **ice showers** / spraying my body down with water to stop the burning feeling 24/7\\n* A single long hair from my head **grazing against my cheek would trigger pain** and wincing,\\n* **couldn\\'t brush my teeth** some days, as squeezing a fist to hold the toothbrush hurt,\\n* **washing my hands** felt like acid,\\n* even just **rolling a sleeve up** to my elbow would make my teeth grit with pain,\\n* often had to **sleep naked** without any blankets, as even a **duvet would be agony**\\n* often spent days/evenings **naked stood in front of a cold fan**, to relieve the burning\\n\\nAnd believe it or not, last year was a \\'good year\\', the previous two had been much worse. Not sure how I made it through those first two, to be honest - this subreddit is partially responsible I\\'m sure! <3\\n\\nSimilar to many people here, with the above symptoms always cropping up, I slowly cancelled my previous life, day by day, to accommodate the symptoms, and became a different person with quite a limited life. Summers were easier, but that would risk me taking it too far, only to ruin the subsequent month. Tried part time work on M, W, F (am a software engineer lucky enough to work from home, ideal for ice shower breaks), but - as I am sure everyone here is aware - symptoms don\\'t work in a way where you can tell your body only to hurt on a Tuesday and Thursday, and my manager at the time was kind of an asshole\\\\*, I could tell he felt a bit impatient and disappointed every time I had a failed \\'phase back to work\\' period. After two or so years swinging between full-time and part-time, I fully stopped working a year ago, and do side hobbies and projects to keep my mind occupied and self esteem from plummeting too much!\\n\\n**Now:**\\n\\n* averaging **only 9 hours sleep**,\\n* barely any blackouts,\\n* in **pain only one or two days a week**, and the level is much lower on average,\\n* flare ups tend to be more of a \"this is quite *annoying*, but I don\\'t want to die\" on the pain scale,\\n* I\\'m **able to walk** short to medium distances without having a relapse (working on long distance!),\\n* electric shock / chest pains happen **only once a fortnight**, if that,\\n* never have to sleep sitting up,\\n* in November and December combined, I had **only 2 major flare ups** (ie bedbound or pain unmanageable). Previously it **would have been 40+ major flare ups** in that timespan,\\n* brain fog **only during major flares**,\\n* **secondary infections lasting a normal timespan** \\\\- I had a cold for only THREE DAYS. THREE FUCKING DAYS. AND IT WAS AMAZING. 10/10 best cold I ever had.\\n* **wearing clothes doesn\\'t hurt** 95% of the time,\\n* chest feels much less tight,\\n* **no longer need an inhaler**,\\n\\n>Unfortunately, and perhaps inevitably, the above *has* worsened greatly since Christmas, with a nasty relapse last week, *but* I imagine that is a reaction to exertion with seeing family/friends (either that, or, the universe saw me grinning with gratitude on NYE, toasting to being \\'*COMPLETELY BETTER*\\', and decided to call me out on my bullshit), so I\\'ll happily take it on the chin after several months of comparitive bliss.\\n\\n# What I Tried (What Failed)\\n\\nWaded slowly through the much appreciated but chronically underfunded steaming shitpile that is the NHS for most of this journey. Too much to mention and I will not bore you with the horror stories as even reliving them might make me flare up again ha, but - as I am sure everyone reading this can relate - I **cannot understate how much admin and nonsense has consumed this timeline**.\\n\\n>Wait, no, the one vaguely funny NHS fuckup story was > wait six months to attend a specialist clinic where \\'10 doctors will see you individually and discuss together\\' (brilliant, I thought!) > on arrival, realise they have sent me to a rash clinic (I do not have a rash) > photographer introduces me as Lucy (my name is not Lucy) and asks me to undress so he can take pics of my massive rash > I tell him I do not have a massive rash, not even a little rash, that I have no rash > he doesn\\'t hear me, leaves the room and asks me to undress for his return > I get socially awkward so start undressing > ten doctors individually come into a room to inspect me one by one > ten times I say \\'I don\\'t have a rash\\' > ten times, a doctor says \\'oh\\' and leaves. I hope the real Lucy and her giant rash are okay.\\n\\nYou can skim through my post history if you want a better snapshot of treatments I tried, as this post is getting hefty now, but before you do, know that the conclusion from past attempts is that ***nothing really worked*** for me back then apart from a short period on painkillers (amitryptaline), but that came at a price of sleeping even more, needing more and more dosage, and losing myself. I also found anti-histamines to be helpful for six months or so in 2021, but to be honest, I think it was because it was summer and I was working less, so able to rest more and that\\'s why I noticed the pain lessening.\\n\\nMy timeline involved two **Long Covid clinic**s, one of which I **recommend, at UCLH**. The other, in Oxford, was a time wasting, tickbox-esque insulting experience - their only advice was to sleep for a month (?) and then to seek psychiatric help when I followed up saying it was still bad. I was told \\'there is a difference between pain and suffering\\', and offered more anti-depressants. **UCLH have been brilliant** on the other hand, and are really on the ball with their research, diagnostic tests, and just generally I had a feeling that the doctors fully understand the gravity of the situation and take you seriously.\\n\\n**Tests I\\'ve had:** bone marrow biopsy (that one sucked), small fibre neuropathy biopsies x 4, MRI x 3, PET CT x 1, various ECGs, 24h heart monitor, skin allergy tests, EMG, and various bloods over the years. Nothing massively helpful came from the majority of them, apart from POTS diagnosis with the heart tests, consistent (out of range) low white blood cell count, consistent low (out of range) red blood cell count, low platelet count, and signs of high inflammation in blood samples and bone marrow sample. Which begs the question, wtf is my blood made from then bruv?\\n\\nSpent endless hours, months, years researching any possible cause for my symptoms and trialing new things. Mast cell activation syndrome, blood clots, nerve damage desensitisation therapy, blood disorders, autoimmune diseases (I already had Hashimoto\\'s pre-existing), proximity to covid, tried gluten free, sugar free, alcohol free, guzzled bathtubs of manuka honey, used spike mats, read books and peer reviewed studies on how trauma stays in the body, and at one very low point, made an appointment with a spiritual doctor who did a funky thing with a warm rug and called me beautiful until I cried. That was rather out of character for me, as I\\'m painfully skeptical about anything not scientifically backed. But perhaps that is why it did not help. Even considered one of those horribly manipulative money making programs where you \"re-train\" your mind and stop being such a lazy pain victim, god! Bad is now good, and if you think bad is bad, you\\'re the problem! (Only mentioning the latter few as an indication of how desperate I was for a solution, and big love to anyone who has gone down a homeopathy/spiritual route and found it to work). The research kept my mind occupied and gave me hope, but I definitely had periods where I gave up and didn\\'t want to continue.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# What Seems To Work\\n\\nYou\\'ve made it this far through my rambles, you deserve the happy ending xD.\\n\\n**In short: iron, and a much, much simpler life.** Drinking lots of liquid iron has been the single most effective thing I have tried. This may mean I just had anaemia all along, but in case it\\'s helpful for anyone else, it really changed a lot more than just fatigue. Worth noting my red blood cell count and other signs of anaemia all cropped up immediately after getting covid, and one doctor suggested covid can trigger these things. I stupidly put anaemia to the side, taking iron sporadically, as I naively thought \\'this is the least of my problems right now, I\\'m on fucking fire\\'.\\n\\nAs for the rest of it, despite going through absolute hell for the first few years (so I do feel owed this relieving of pain), the past years recovery has been only possible because I\\'m very lucky. May not be helpful for many people, as every case is unique, and it may not be the answer many people can afford to hear as - to be honest - I am immensely privileged to have been able to make these adjustments to improve my health! **My income is protected now that my symptoms are officially a disability**, **I have an EU passport**, and I am **in a relationship** with someone who is earning, **acts as my carer**, *and* is able to live the same lifestyle as me. Any one of those disappearing would likely have blocked this level of recovery. My heart goes out to anyone dealing with this hell without income protection or routes to a stress free lifestyle, especially people with kids, I wouldn\\'t have been able to cope looking after more than just myself. I also want to say I don\\'t want to sound preachy or suggest anything too radical, nor simplistic, as I always got defensive and frustrated when reading those posts myself, and I still believe \\'everything in moderation\\', and life really is no fun when you live it perfectly sensibly.\\n\\nSo, take this advice with a massive pinch of disclaimer salt that I\\'m aware I\\'m massively privileged to have done the latter batch of these:\\n\\n* **Drink liquid iron 200-300% daily recommended dose every day**, the tablets made me sick but liquid form has been game changing. This is the single biggest change I have felt. This is when I stopped sleeping 12-16 hours and started sleeping 9 hours. The body pain, chest pains, breathing problems etc etc all lessened alongside.\\n* **I moved away from London**, away from England, for lots of the year - always, always, always somewhere with **sun, warmth and low air pollution**. This is where I knew my symptoms would ease. Canary Islands, Azores, Italy, etc. I can\\'t believe I hadn\\'t done this properly sooner, as my job was fully remote anyway and I had EU citizenship, but I was a bit trapped in the guilt mindset of \\'I shouldn\\'t get on a plane if I have Long Covid\\', \\'It might look like I\\'m seeking a holiday lifestyle\\', but all my stints away are month-long, settled, and everyday life. Instead of trudging to Tesco\\'s in the cold, I am exerting less and driving my little car down the Alps to a bio supermarket. (Have I sold it to you yet?). I realised that I either stay in London and get worse, or leave and potentially get better, at the risk of colleagues or loose acquaintances thinking I\\'m milking it. At the end of the day, your health is the only thing you have. I decided I wanted to drop everything in the name of recovery. **Sunshine and warmth works for me.**\\n* **Away from bugs/viruses/stressy people** \\\\- picking up far less infections, have far less responsibilities, good friends have stayed in touch, but will be honest that I think my health has improved having reduced my friendships\\n* **Reduced connectivity and exertion**: I exert myself *dramatically* less physically and emotionally when I am living in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nature, allowing my phone to die for 2 days at a time sometimes,\\n* **HATE THIS ONE I\\'M SO SORRY GUYS BUT I eat a much cleaner diet** (sadly by force, not many takeaways in the sticks xD), I don\\'t avoid anything in particular like gluten or sugar, I just eat more fresh unprocessed foods, though I do still eat a bit of crap because life isn\\'t worth living without crisps,\\n* I **deleted all social media**, which lessened my anxiety and depression massively,\\n* I **stopped working** as a software engineer, and will resume when my health is 100%, rather than just 70%,\\n* By pausing work, I have **reduced my stress levels substantially**, as well as screen time, and idle sitting at desks - which is what made the POTS act up badly,\\n* I make sure to **cold water swim -** oceans beat cold showers.\\n\\nTLDR: Iron, and a less workaholic/city dweller lifestyle. Still looking to fully recover so will update if I find something else that makes as much as an impact as the above!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>\\\\*For those who are in a similar situation/love gossip, here is my sidestory from work: manager disclosed my medical information to multiple colleagues without consent, expressed doubt of my ill-health, passed around my social media for people to \\'judge\\' whether I was \\'actually sick\\', and they (all middle aged white men btw #tech) then together formed opinions of \"if she is well enough to attend X, she should be working full time\". Where X would be my mothers book launch, or a smiley photo of me in the sunshine whilst mid-flare, or with friends, where I would pay the price for *days* after exerting myself. God forbid the sick seek quality of life, sunshine, and family to stay mentally above water. Was doubly tricky though because part of the mental battle with Long Covid for the first two years was anxiety over whether people thought I was faking it, or exaggerating, given I was so young and looked fine. On days when I *didn\\'t* get symptoms I would doubt myself, and found it incredibly hard to give myself permission to rest - so hearing colleagues judge me as \\'not that sick, if she looks happy on Instagram\\' really fucked with my head for a bit! Was subsequently strangely vindicating every time I got a terrible, disabling, multi-day flare during that period as I could at least lay there thinking \\'well, this is hella real\\', hahaha. Medical misogny / assumptions that I must be a young deviant girl looking for free time off work definitely played into many doctors visits in 2020+2021 (before it got really so bad that even pain-deniers couldn\\'t refuse investigation on this particular hysterical lady), and it felt rather upsetting that similar judgements had seeped into my work life, all the while I was in bed in pain. Which for the record is NOT when one takes selfies. xD  \\n>  \\n>ANYWAY, had to speak to an employment lawyer who confirmed it was all completely illegal for him to do that, so got that confidently under my belt if he does it again, but decided not to take action as I think the stress wouldn\\'t be good for my body, plus I\\'m at a stage of acceptance and recovery where I don\\'t really mind whether people believe it or not, and finally I do understand  ignorance and distance to the person might cause some people to make snap judgements, and try to give him benefit of doubt. So despite it being pretty shitty, perhaps he was trying to protect the company.... Ok, no, I\\'m reaching. He was a knob. Happy endings all round, though: Thankfully now have a new manager who is entirely understanding and hasn\\'t guilted me whatsoever for putting health first. And, unrelated to this but with mental health in mind, I stopped using all social media in 2022, which did lessen anxiety about speculation, too. If you\\'re in a similar situation, do read up on your disability at work rights, it helped me feel much less panicked!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Sorry if this post is only helpful for people suffering from fatigue and/or burning sensation on skin, wishing it gives out a bit of hope regardless <3**', 'comments': ['NOTE This message is triggered by keywords in your post, no need to take it personally.

What could go wrong?*\\n\\n*Darkos, holy priest of Alerion, only ever wanted to defeat a great evil and complete his pilgrimage. But when he discovers his innocent, sweet, and catastrophically clumsy companion, Geela, is actually the exact evil sorceress he swore to destroy, his best-laid plans are turned on their head.*\\n\\n*In Geela’s defense, she only needed an escort home because her ex-husband changed the locks. However, Darkos has grown on Geela, much like a beloved pet. Or a fungus.*\\n\\n*Things might have gone sideways, but they can make this work. After all, Geela needs a minion to help hunt down her ex, and Darkos is convinced he can find a scrap of redemption in her cold, dead heart.*\\n\\n*But Geela might not be the only one whose soul needs saving.*\\n\\n[***Buy the ebook or find the story on KU***](https://geni.us/GeelaRS) ***(paperback pending but on its way!)***\\n\\n___\\n\\n**Chapter One: Welcome Home!**\\n\\nDarkos reached a hand down to help Geela up a particularly steep incline, the final one of their journey. The actual final one. Not any of the “I think this one *must* be the last one”s that he’d fed his increasingly exhausted companion every time she stumbled or tripped uphill. This time, he meant it.\\n\\nWith their destination, the Dark Fortress, now fully in view, he opened his mouth to congratulate Geela on actually making it.\\n\\n“This one *must* be the last one,” Geela said as she crested the peak, wiping a bead of sweat from her neck. She caught Darkos’s still open mouth and giggled, a cheeky grin on her face.\\n\\nHe grinned back. “Yeah. This one *must* be it.” The good mood was infectious. They were so close to their goal after so many months of traveling, and neither was about to suppress their excitement. The two were reaching the end of a year-long quest for revenge—for Geela—and a two-year-long pilgrimage for salvation—for Darkos.\\n\\nGeela’s bright green eyes widened in awe as she took in the castle. “It’s every bit as terrible as I’d heard,” she said, voice wavering just a tad. Then she looked to Darkos. “Thank you. Really, thank you. I never would’ve made it this far if you hadn’t—” She broke off, eyes growing teary, and Darkos wrapped an arm around her frail shoulders. “I’m sorry, I’m being so silly. I just still can’t believe that I, a simple farm girl, could possibly have made it here.” Her voice trembled with emotion. “I owe you so much.”\\n\\n“Don’t think twice on it. We helped each other, and I couldn’t have done this without your support either.” Truth be told, he was struggling to keep a few tears from showing himself. They still had a long and terrible battle ahead of them, but they’d gotten *this far* on a task that no one else had even gotten close on. If he didn’t have to be strong for Geela, his emotion would be showing through too.\\n\\nIt wasn’t every day that Darkos got to reach the end of a two-year journey to defeat a wicked overlord. In fact, this had happened only five times before. Well, approximately five. It was a toss-up as to whether or not Sir Direbane counted, but that had been Darkos’s first pilgrimage, and he’d only been eighteen. He could be excused for letting the dastardly noble’s soul escape. Each of the subsequent four pilgrimages had ended with the defeat of some evildoer, every one of them more supremely terrible than the last.\\n\\nStill, it had been a jump to go from a half-giant that wouldn’t let people cross a bridge to the most damned person on the planet.\\n\\nMalevolence incarnate, some called her. Void witch. Dread overlord. She who wipes out kingdoms with a single breath. The scourge of the land for over half a century, responsible for more destruction and devastation than anyone else in recorded history. \\n\\nEvil sorceress, Ja’Eel Scilatia. \\n\\nIt had been bold—borderline stupid—for Darkos to take on the task where so many had failed. But, for the good of the world, he’d wanted to. And for the redemption of his soul, he knew he had to. He would not fail his God again.\\n\\nNo, it was time for Ja’Eel to meet her match.\\n\\n“I hope she’s there when we open the door,” Geela said, her voice faltering as they approached the front gate. “Get this over with. I know it would be safer if we snuck in, but my nerves…”\\n\\nAgain, Darkos put a comforting hand on her shoulder. “I won’t make you do anything you’re not comfortable with. This is a joint mission, so you get a say too.” In all honesty, his companion may have been fiercely loyal, but even at his most generous, Darkos was forced to admit that attempting to sneak in with Geela would be like announcing their arrival with a marching band practicing exclusively on pots and pans. This was assuming Geela didn’t trip and break herself stepping over the threshold. He was terribly fond of her, but she was, in fact, that klutzy.\\n\\n“Do your priest senses detect her?” This had been an oft-repeated question of Geela’s, starting when they first met and following them all the way to the castle. Of course, given what Ja’Eel had done to the poor girl’s uncle, he understood her caution.\\n\\n“They don’t,” he said. But this time it was starting to bug him. He’d always been able to pick up on the subtleties of magic, and he hadn’t really expected to sense Ja’Eel much during their journey through her lands, but now it didn’t quite add up. He should’ve felt her by now.\\n\\n“She’s planning something wicked, I just know it.” Geela clasped her fingers together, eyes shimmering with anxious tears. “Is the door trapped? I heard a rumor it might be.”\\n\\nDarkos gripped the handle to the door, and sure enough, heat surged through it, stinging his palms. With a jerk, he pulled his hands away, and studied the door intently. It wasn’t otherwise locked. He could do this. They hadn’t traversed so far only to be turned away by a burning doorknob, and Darkos could always heal his hands after.\\n\\nSo he wrapped them in cloth and wrenched the doors open with a mighty groan. The doors groaned in response as he pulled them, but once they were halfway open, they completed the arc themselves. Darkos pulled his stinging hands off the handles and healed them in quick order. Wouldn’t do to have his hands burning when it came time to face down Ja’Eel.\\n\\n“I’ll go first,” he said, his voice a whisper. With one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other carefully in front of Geela, he peered into the entry hall.\\n\\n“I trust you,” she whispered back, and gave his hand a squeeze. The two had made an odd pair, her fluttery appetite for adventure and his righteous fervor. Truth be told, a companion hadn’t been part of the plan. He’d stumbled across the clumsy woman—sobbing into a pint of ale—at an inn near the mouth of the cavern that marked the entrance to Ja’Eel’s territory. When Darkos had asked what troubled her, she’d wrung her hands as she tripped over herself to explain the tragic loss of her family at Ja’Eel’s hands and her desperation to enact revenge. Her heart had never truly seemed to be in killing Ja’Eel, but her conviction to make it there had never wavered, so Darkos had assured her; he’d do the killing.\\n\\nHe stepped into the entryway of the massive castle, not calling up a light orb just yet. Something seemed… off. Where he expected terrifying, towering traps or other such malevolent oddities, he found, instead, a dusty hallway. The place looked as deserted up close as it had from a distance. Either the building truly was empty, or the Dark Sorceress was playing a game with them.\\n\\nHe put a hand on the hilt of his sword and held out an arm to guard his companion. Geela’s near-lethal clumsiness marked her as a target to the most mundane of obstacles: ogres, hydras. Steep ladders. She wouldn’t stand a chance against a sneak attack, and Ja’Eel could be anywhere.\\n\\n“I think we’re in the clear,” Darkos said, eyes combing for any of the familiar signs of Ja’Eel’s magic. “No traps, no monsters. We just need to find her now.”\\n\\n\"Aren’t you a dear. Sweet, if entirely clueless. Oh but it is *good* to be home again.\"\\n\\nDarkos froze. The voice came, not from in front of him, or perhaps overhead, as he’d expected. No. No, the voice came from *behind* him.\\n\\nBefore he could even turn, Geela—petite, golden-haired, doe-eyed farmer\\'s daughter Geela—strode past him, her eyes closed, inhaling deeply. She spun in the hallway, head back, arms stretched wide, a gesture that would look more in place in the middle of a sun-soaked meadow than in a decrepit, cobwebby castle.\\n\\nAfter a few twirls and a long sigh, her eyes snapped open, and the look of bliss vanished from her face at the surrounding mess. “Ugh. I’m sorry you have to see it like this.” Darkos’s eyes followed her disdainful hand wave as she gestured at the dingy interior. “It’s normally such a lovely place.” She planted her hands on her hips, staring at the water stained carpet. “I never would have ordinarily let my home get this bad. There’s a reason for all this filth—a whole history even more tragic than the sham I made up for you. Tea, by the way? I know I promised you a cup when we finally got home.”\\n\\nDarkos stared intently at Geela, parsing her sentences very, *very* slowly. He blinked at her, squinting hard. It was like every time he closed his eyes, he saw the sweet, distressed woman who had daringly joined him. Then his eyelids flipped open, and there Geela stood, nose wrinkled, eyes hard, surveying the room with cold disdain.\\n\\n“I don\\'t understand,” Darkos said.\\n\\n“Oh. Well, yes, I suppose you pictured our little victory tea party happening in a thatched hut or whatever sunny little hovel you thought I lived in.” She waved a hand and murmured an incantation, one Darkos was pretty sure he heard a few curses dropped in. All around her, dust floated off the suits of armor and tabletops. The candles burst into flames, filling the hall with a not-unpleasant glow, as various furniture rearranged itself.\\n\\n“That’s not the part I don\\'t understand,” he said, trying not to be distracted by a floating armchair.\\n\\n“Oh, you *did* think I lived in a castle? That’s more perceptive than I would have given you credit for. I am, however, offended that you’d pegged me for living in such a rundown one. Oh, drat.” She dropped her hands, staring at tiny, scattered pebbles on the ground. “We have mice. Guess the cats didn\\'t stick around. Come on!” she shouted into the empty room. “It\\'s been two years, you couldn\\'t stick it out?”\\n\\n“No, Geela, I don\\'t understand!”\\n\\n“What! The cats left, the mice are playing, and now I need to buy more cats to get rid of—”\\n\\n“No, you died.” Darkos couldn\\'t believe it. “You died, and I brought you back. Like at least three times. Four if you count the mushrooms, which I still do.” He shoved his hands in his pockets. “You always told me how lucky you were to have a priest traveling with you.” Geela\\'s various grisly fates flash through Darkos’s mind like a storybook from hell. How had this been part of some master plan?\\n\\n“Well, I *was* lucky.” She turned back to him, something resembling sincerity on her face. “A healer wasn’t really part of the plan, let alone a priest. You just fell out of the sky and landed next to me while I was crying about Barney.” The sincere look vanished as her eyes turned dark.\\n\\n“Was Barney… no, that wasn’t your uncle, was it?” He’d never quite remembered the name of Geela’s departed family, and given her venomous glare, he’d gotten it wrong again.\\n\\n“No. No, Barney is my damned ex-husband. A real piece of work, him. He’s the one who locked me out in the first place.” She whirled on her heel and stormed down the hall, waving a hand as the place continued to reconstruct itself. “We were the perfect couple. Always communicated well. Split the chores fifty-fifty. I was in charge of evil schemes, taking over countries, cursing royal children, and stealing precious artifacts. He was the house spouse. Took care of the castle and everything.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, her heel came down hard on a very out-of-place tea cup, and its mournful shatter punctuated her last statement.\\n\\nDarkos succeeded in suppressing any kind of laughter at this. Mostly. He still got a nasty look from Geela.\\n\\n“Well, he was fine at it for *most* of the relationship. And it wasn’t just housekeeping. He was the one who came up with all the guardians, traps, and the like. He was happy with the split. He always said he was happy. He didn’t mind staying at home.” She snapped twice, and the large double doors at the end of the entry opened, leading to a truly disgusting dining hall. A nauseating odor wafted out. “Damn him to *hell*. Never fall in love, Darkos. Never do it. Love’s good for one thing only: breaking your heart, stealing your stuff, changing your locks, and leaving you broken.”\\n\\nDarkos opened his mouth to—probably foolishly—correct Geela’s counting, but a wave of stench washed over him, saving him from the potential anger he’d have incurred for his comment. Instead, he covered his mouth with a cloth and followed Geela into the dining chamber. He wanted to say something in response to her furious monologue, but he was still trying to reconcile this new revelation with everything he’d ever thought he’d known about her. She just didn\\'t look the part, all frail hands and bouncy gold locks. It was hard to picture her doing anything malevolent.\\n\\n“I resurrected you,” he settled on. “How could this have been your master plan if you died so many times? The sea monster that guarded the lake we had to cross—”\\n\\n“See, Barney knew I hated krakens. I didn\\'t even know he put one in the lake. That was my bad; I should have assumed something was fishy, beyond just the piranhas.”\\n\\n“But the hydra—”\\n\\n“That one hurt the most. Emotionally, not physically. Kraken takes that inglorious cake. But Silvy... I raised her from a hatchling.” Geela closed her eyes, allowing herself a moment to mourn the twenty-three headed fiend. “All the monsters guarding the castle were controlled by a codeword that we were both supposed to know. I hadn’t thought to check in the last year we lived together because I *trusted* him. What a prick.” The smell in the hall had lessened as the rotting food across the tables disintegrated into a fine powder. “Looks like he invited all his buddies over to trash the place before skipping town.”\\n\\n“That cursed potion, though—”\\n\\n“I thought *that*, at the very least, would be safe. I kept the antidote, so I figured even if I grabbed the wrong one it\\'d be fine, but as soon as my hair caught fire…”\\n\\nDarkos had spent endless nights praying to Alerion to maintain the power necessary for all the resurrections he\\'d cast. He had potentially strained his relationship with his deity, all to walk an evil sorceress home.\\n\\nThe more he thought about it, the more mixed up he felt. How had he even been able to resurrect Geela? How could Alerion, the God of peace and healing, have allowed such a monster to keep returning to the Mortal Realm?\\n\\n“Oh, nice. Look at this. In my own hall.” Geela held up what could only be a skimpy undergarment, the kind succubi and harpies often wore. “Feathers too. Ugh. It was the cheating that really started this whole,” she waved her hand, still clutching the brassiere, at the much cleaner room, “*debacle*. I found out in the worst way you can find out.” Geela brought her hands together in something that might have resembled a sinister clasp had it not been the garment still twined around her fingers. A look of disgust broke her steely glare, and she dropped the offending article.\\n\\n“How?” Darkos asked, curious despite himself. “Did you find out, I mean.”\\n\\n“Oh goodness, Darkos, you’re really going to make me say it?” Her cheeks flushed. “I *walked in on them*. It was truly terrible. Of course, I toasted that smug minx into coal dust right away. Barney tried to excuse himself for exactly twelve seconds before giving up. I still remember him, mouth agape, fumbling for words, eyes darting from me to the ashes of his mistress that still coated the bed.” There was an ugly look in her green eyes, and suddenly Darkos could very much picture her doing something malevolent. “Then *all* the lies seeped right out of the woodwork. I just never would have expected it. Cheating. When he knew how much my first relationship had broken me. Did I tell you about that one? That dreadful boy, Tarren Carlisle?”\\n\\n“No! No, you didn’t tell me that.” Darkos crossed his arms, feeling betrayed. “I think you conveniently left out a lot.” He knew his lip was jutting in something of a pout, but he couldn’t help it.\\n\\nGeela looked at him, her sugar-sweet eyes softening. “Oh, I’ve hurt your feelings. I didn\\'t mean to take advantage, I really didn\\'t. But I needed an escort.”\\n\\n“I thought you were helping me defeat the evil sorceress.”\\n\\n“Well, I mean, *yes*, I did tell you that. If lying upsets you, you\\'d blush if you heard what I did to the King of the Southern Polar Region.” She sighed, fixing the hall with a glum stare. “This is going to take hours to fix up. And I promised you tea. Still interested?”\\n\\nInterested in tea, no. Interested in learning more about Geela and how she’d managed to trick both him *and* Alerion, yes. Absolutely yes.\\n\\nThe next thing he knew, he was slowly sinking into a squishy sofa, gripping a mug of lavender tea. Across from him, draped across a far fancier chaise, Geela bemoaned Barney’s betrayal. She’d plowed her way through three mugs by now as the whole story—at least, the part pertaining to Geela’s breakup—came tumbling out.\\n\\n“Never marry a coworker,” she said, as she drowned her sorrows in her fourth mug. “In fact, just don\\'t marry. Not worth the headache.”\\n\\nThe two sat in silence as Geela finished the last sip of her tea and let out a long sigh.\\n\\n“So what do you think?” she asked, looking up from her mug, face more composed. “Rest for a few days, pick up the place, and then get going?”\\n\\n“Get… going?\" He blinked. “You’re kicking me out?” It did make sense. He was a holy priest, and she was an evil sorceress. Technically, he was lucky to still be alive.\\n\\n“Well, I need revenge. For real, this time. And you know how clumsy I am when adventuring. It\\'s really not my thing, but the bastard needs to be taken down a few pegs.” She stood up and brushed a streak of dust off her baby blue gown, before fixing Darkos with an emerald stare. “What do you say? Up for another adventure?”\\n\\nThe fact that they were even having this conversation was beyond surreal. Darkos had come here to kill her. She knew that but seemed wholly unconcerned. And on one hand, as one of the most feared evildoers in recent history, she probably didn’t have to be concerned. On the other hand, Darkos had seen her in action. He wasn’t terribly impressed.\\n\\nWhich brought him back to Alerion. This pilgrimage had been his sixth, an unheard-of number in his church. Somehow, despite bestowing a cause upon every other priest, Alerion had withheld the blessing that would have given true purpose to Darkos’s wandering.\\n\\nCould this have been the reason? Could there be some deeper meaning behind him befriending this wretched woman? Darkos thought over the adventures they’d had together, the late nights drinking ale by their firepit, and the subsequent hungover battles when they were jumped in their sleep. He couldn’t help but feel, deep down inside, that there was something very human in Geela.\\n\\nMaybe he could do more than just defeat her. Maybe he could sway her back to the light. Maybe the first step towards redemption came in the form of teaching her forgiveness. Compassion. Kindness.\\n\\nA startled squeak snapped Darkos out of his thoughts, and he looked up in time to see Geela shoot a small zap of lightning at a mouse, which flew across the kitchen in a dramatic arc.\\n\\n…or maybe not.\\n\\nBut one thing was absolutely sure. If he left her now, Darkos would never know why Alerion had saved Geela, why the God had given him the power to resurrect her over and over. Darkos would return to his village once again, would attend the yearly Sending Off once again, and would, once again, fail to be given a true purpose.\\n\\nCompared to that, what was going along with this? By helping Geela start her quest for vengeance, maybe he could help sway her off the path of evil. Some good may come of this yet.\\n\\nHe sighed, mind made up. “When do you want to leave?\"', 'comments': [\"If you would like to receive a private message whenever the post author submits a new part, you can leave a command below in response to this sticky.\\n\\r\\n\\r> HelpMeButler <The Extramundane Emancipation of Geela, Evil Sorceress at Large>\\n\\r\\n\\rIf you posted it correctly, you'll get a confirmation PM!\\n\\r\\n\\rPlease remember to be kind to each other.

We live in privatized off-post housing with fellow members/ retirees. This is being provided to stress the unique situation we\\'re in.\\n\\nFor the greater part of close to a year and a half my family has been subjected to several microagressions from multiple neighbors. However, their is one in particular who really takes the cake. I\\'ll refer to them as the Head Narcissist In Charge (HNIC). This family is a husband, wife and toddler. They moved in next door about two months after us. The very first violation of our privacy was them moving our package on the front porch. My family was out of town and our package was delivered a day earlier than expected. We had placed a camera in our front window just in case that happened. While on our trip, my hubby and I received notifications of activity on the porch. Mind you this was at about 10 p.m. at night. We didn\\'t know at the time but the HNIC\\'s  husband was captured seemingly trying to steal our package. I guess he wasn\\'t aware that we had the camera in the window because as soon as he began to walk away he looked back   and placed the package down behind the colum post on our porch. At the time neither I or my husband knew who he was. We thought it was some random person because we never met him prior to this interaction. I personally did have a situation previously where the wifes (HNIC) package was delivered to our door. I returned it to her and introduced my self and my two children. She thanked me and introduced herself and told me that she had a son. Her husband was the only one who wasn\\'t introduced. Even during this encounter I could tell something was off about her but I kept it respectful and brief. I\\'ll also mention that this was while my husband was deployed at that time. \\n\\nWhen my family arrived home the next day we had picked up a front door camera on our way home from the trip. As soon as we got home we began installing the doorcam. As we were installing it, the neighbors came up and the HNIC informed us that they moved it because the package was \"in view from the street\". I had my back turned during the whole conversation and never spoke a word and kept working on the camera. My husband responded and was like okay, thanks! But we were both very upset. Primarily because we didn\\'t know that the man was the neighbor. Essentially they told on themselves. Another thing I noticed was that the husband also never spoke during the whole interaction but I could see in the reflection of my window that he had a smirk on his face. I know you may be wondering why I nor my husband let them have it in that momment. Well my family is mostly introverted we can be social at times but much rather be left alone. Also, I don\\'t like confrontation unless absolutely necessary. At the time since the package wasn\\'t stolen and we knew who it was on the camera we decided to delete footage of that night because we had intended to file a police report if the package had been taken. We truly regret that now. Ever since this incident things have continued to get worse with these people. After installing the camera, they have been using their toddler as an excuse to come on our walkway and driveway which they know triggers our camera. I have several videos including the husband snooping around our Apartment and cutting across our driveway numerous times at night. One evening in particular the husband was walking next to his son in the grass crossing into our driveway. I was sitting in my car working on something when I looked up and noticed him bent down looking directly into my garage. I didn\\'t immediately see his son because he\\'s very small. I stepped out the car and asked if I could help him in a firm voice. He then stood up straight grabbed his sons hand and proceeded to tell me that \"he was just getting his son.\" He seemed very surprised that I had said anything to him. I then told him to stop harrassing my family he said he wasn\\'t harrassing anyone and I told him that no he wasn\\'t just trying to get his son and that he had been doing things like this for months. I told him bye and he did apologize picked up his son and left. I know how this sounds it makes me look like the bad guy right? Well I assure you this was all an act because I ended up having to call the police after what happened next. After this all went down I called my husband who was on duty, because he wasn\\'t home that night and I told him everything that happened. Midconversation, this man I\\'ve never seen before is standing in my driveway with his dog staring at my camera. I started to freak out because it was just me and my sons at home. I was already on edge because of the 1st situation and also because I had a recent ER trip and wasn\\'t at my best . So having yet another strange man pop up was alarming. After viewing the footage I realized that this man was the father to a kid whom I had placed a complaint on to the landlord. Then it all made sense. I believe it was a form of retaliation. I guess he thought we were trying to pick on those neighbors too when we\\'ve never done anything to either of them. This man with the dogs son had been bringing his dog to my front porch and the surrounding area to poop and pee for about 7 months prior to all of this taking place. I would go on walks in the early a.m. around 4 in the morning and coming home this boy would be at my front porch with that same dog. I would open my window in the morning by my front door and there the boy was with his dog. I would look at him as if to say who are you and where are your parents but I never spoke a word to him. Even after catching him coming from behind my trash cans in a black hoodie one morning coming home from my walk. He had wedged himself past the trash cans in between my and our attached neighbors townhouse allowing the dog to go right up against the house. When I was walking up from a far I thought it was a grown person but as I got closer I realized it was yet again this same kid. The majority of these antics took place while my husband was deployed in 22\"- June 23\" and pre-door camera/ driveway camera installation. Things changed though once my husband was back from deployment. Finally, having cameras to prove this behavior and dealing with a few unpleasant gifts from his dog, my husband and I had enough. We reported this to the leasing office. After explaining to our leasing people and providing them the videos they said that it was against the rules for people with pets to not pickup after their animals and they understood how him coming on the front porch could be bothersome. They agreed to issue a warning to his parents. The subsequent week I guess the local gossips had made it known about the warning being issued. Most of the people on the block turned out to I guess to do a show of force by actively \"walking their dogs\" day or night through our drive way allowing their kids to run through our drive way. Multiple kids hanging out in the drive way random kids running from around our home to run on our walkway leading to the porch and driveway. The same day the warning was issued the same kid with the dog came back and ran through our porch. I later learned from the video that his mother was standing across the street watching him do all of this. My husband was fed up and sprayed some non-toxic animal detterient along the grassy area leading from our front porch to our driveway. To keep the dogs away because then the HNIC\\'s two small dogs were off leash pooping and peeing by our front porch too now. So a second warning was issued to the same kid with the dog. My husband mentioned to the leasing office that it was clearly intentional. After that warning that\\'s when you get the dad in my driveway at 10 at night looking at my camera. I guess he was trying to intimidate me but the man seemed like he was drunk. I called the security for our development to ask them to just show force but I was redirected to speak with non emergency 911. My husband and I 3-way called and gave a report of everything that happened but no officers came to my home until the next morning. I met with an officer and showed him the video he agreed that both of the men\\'s behavior was strange but they hadn\\'t done anything criminal so he couldn\\'t do anything. He did give me some options though. He told me that I could file a non-violent(if there is such a thing let me know) restraining order against the (HNIC) neighbors due to our history and he told me about the trespassing laws for California. He told me that people looking in the garage isn\\'t a crime however, if they enter my drive way or come into the garage I could have them tresspased if they refuse to leave. The officer also told me that the driveway is considered private so I have every right to ask people to leave. He just reccomended that I post a no tresspass sign or some how fence the area. Seeing as we rent the sign was the best bet. I asked him about the 2 party filming consent laws and he told me that their is \"no such thing as privacy in a public space\" and that I was free to record as long as cameras are in clear view and not infringing on our neighbors privacy ie. filming their homes specifically areas that are ment to be private ie.bathrooms. Based on our camera set up he assured me that I was doing things by the book. I mean we have stickers posted in our windows and garage window to let people know If they enter those spaces it is being monitored.  He gave me a case number, no official report but to show proof that my call about the incident was addressed. As we were wrapping up, the HNIC came outside with her two dogs just lingering around the edge of her driveway being nosy with a smirk on her face. Then it hit me I believe she or her husband may have been related to the officer because what are the chances that they shared the same last name? Once I realized that, I thanked him for his time and went on with my day. My husband and I had a sit down meeting with our assistant landlord about everything we had endured from these people and showing them the videos as proof. They reccomended that we try to resolve this with the neighbors directly but we refuse to be responsible for inforcing the rules in our lease that everyone signed to not be a nuisance and create disturbances for other neighbors. My family just wants peace, and besides you cannot reason with unreasonable people. We could tell that the assistant wanted to distance themselves but we presented them with yet another issue that was escalated to calling the police this time so we want them to do their job. They reluctanty said that they would issue a warning to them but proposed that if it didn’t remedy things maybe a sit down between us all would be the next best step. If that failed, then commands would need to be involved. This would be a bigger deal because essentially the service members could potentially face dire consequences (lost pay, demotion, restrictions etc.) if they agree with the complaints. I nor my husband want to get people in trouble we just want the nonsense to stop but we agreed that we would be open to it if it came down to that. Sad to say I guess once they also got their warning the microagrssions amped back up. This time including more surrounding neighbors. Things got real out of hand to the point where I stopped allowing my children to go to the parks because some boy ran up on my son and told him not to follow him or he would call the police on him. My son didn\\'t do anything and was just trying to play at the park.  We\\'ve noticed in increase of spying and people surveilling us when we come and go and using their kids to come around our home peaking through our patio door while we were in it to see if we were home. The HNIC neighbors have a camera fixed in their window pointed directly at our front door. Our front porch has a big archway that faces the neighbors front porch so it\\'s not hard to spot. Our front doorbell is a google nest camera so we have it installed with a wedge pointing toward our house. The camera width is pretty good it captures all of our porch area and the street and grassy area minus where the colum blocks view. The only part of the neighboors home that we can see is their walkway and side of the garage and a little piece of their driveway. I can\\'t control how close these buildings were placed together but I have my zone marked to only record activity on our front porch, walkway, and drive way. Nothing is recorded outside those zones, unless someone or something triggers our camera. For instance the HNIC neighbors son, unattended, waddled over to our walkway triggering our camera. He fell down and neither of his parents came to retrieve him but could be heard out of view calling him. Something similar happened with one of their dogs one night. I guess it got loose but the poor thing looked confused and terrified and it was limping. The dog was close up on our front door as if it we\\'re scared of something. The husband could be heard lowly calling the dog. Eventually, the dog limped out of view. My family and I weren\\'t home at that time.The day their son fell the man was complaining about how the camera is facing their house even though it isn\\'t. Well if being filmed is such a concern then why not put up things or be immediately near your child to stop him from triggering our camera? How can they be so concerned about privacy all the while disrespecting ours. The spying got so bad with them that I have literally applied window privacy film to all first and second story windows. You may be wondering why I refer to HNIC neighboor lady as such. Well it\\'s because everytime I\\'m leaving my home she has a new supply of neighbors in her driveway who she is smearing us to. I know this because I\\'ve been told by a mutual neighboor that our family was being talked about. Also, my son heard a conversation between her and others moms talking bad about me. Mind you, I\\'ve never personally spoken to any of these women besides HNIC so where are they getting information about me from?  These are the type of women who sit in their driveways yelling at their spawn to get out the road but hardly ever getting off their duff to play with said children. All the while letting them scream bloody murder the entire time while outside. If you know about military housing then you know. I don\\'t expect many people to understand the various types of cultures, parenting styles, and people in this \"community\". It can either be bliss or chaos. For me I was warned by my retired Navy Vet uncle to avoid military based mom groups like the plague. He told me that all they do is gossip about others and even each other and try or sleep around with each other\\'s spouses. He wasn\\'t wrong the catty group of women around me are always huddled up in chairs or sitting on the concrete gossiping. They would even watch me and my family when we would be outside enjoying time together. They seem to suffer from fomo because some of them just can\\'t help to walk by and comment on whatever we\\'re doing and we just ignore it. If I or my husband seemingly do anything to our cameras or our home it seems to trigger all neighbors most especially HNIC. This past friday I purchased a silconce skin protector for my camera. I waited till evening intentionally to place it and I covered the door bell with stickers to block the light. I did this because these women we\\'re using their kids to cut across our drive way while visiting HNIC in her driveway. As soon as I get notified, I check the camera and see a lady staring at the camera then proceeds to quickly walk inside HNICs garage. I\\'ve seen another neighbor across the street move her chair to the  sidewalk staring at my camera and using other neighborhood kids to intentionally trigger the camera. However, if I or my husband step outside they all act scared and try to not look at us or scatter like roaches. \\n\\nWe\\'ll, I guess their tired of being ignored because as of this past Saturday, something else has happened. HNIC and her husband hosted some type of gathering in the late afternoon. My boys and I had been out most of the day. I had just come back from getting my mail. After, about 30 minutes my husband started getting an onslot of camera notifications. My husband was on duty, are you seeing the pattern yet? He called me and asked me if I saw what was going on but I didn\\'t know anything because I hardly ever keep my phone near by. Once I got it and viewed the video he and I knew that this was yet another retaliation act from something that took place also on friday. Their son was captured on camera at our front door no parent immediately insight. Actually, they were attending to some other kids down by the street.  The boy was looking up at our porch light and backed into our door. My husband and I were expecting a package so when he herd commotion at the door he thought it was our package being delivered. My husband opened the door and called back to me that it wasn\\'t there. Then we checked the camera and saw what the noise was. There was a woman standing behind our colum trying to coax the little boy away. I believe it may be the mother of HNIC because as our family was leaving to go to the store we could see her being fussed at by the lady inside her garage. HNIC quickly gathered their belongings from outside and and ran back into her garage. \\n\\nNow that you also have that background let\\'s continue with the events on Saturday. There were multiple different kids playing soccer, baseball, and toddlers ridding on a kiddie coaster. Now the space between our units isn\\'t very large. This space is also considered communal meaning everyone has a right to it. We didn\\'t care that they were having a get-together but when kids we\\'re playing balls kept being kicked on our walkway, front porch and driveway triggering our cameras. There was a large group of adults some I recognized most I didn\\'t that were huddled in their driveway seemingly trying to avoid being detected on our cameras. There were a few of them who actually came on our front porch to get their child or get the balls for the kids. Then a group of random teenagers cut through the event \\n\"walking their dogs\" close by our front door. It seemed like these event were put together just to recreate past situations that we\\'ve complained about. My husband and I just really didn\\'t understand why they we\\'re trying to trigger a reaction from us considering that we haven\\'t responded to any of their antics since 2023. Our landlord even reached out to me a month prior to ask me if I was still having issues. I told her no, despite the fact that the antics never ceased. I said that because we had made our peace with everything. We know that as long as these people and their kids don\\'t do anything overtly violent or criminal to express their dislike for us, that there wasn\\'t anything we could do  but document. No matter how we slice it we are  being made to feel crazy, isolated, and annoyed. So the party antics was all the exact same as before just a larger scale. \\n\\nThe adult guest in attendance seemed to be watching my door with anticipation everytime someone triggered the camera. These people wanted confrontation they wanted to get another rise out of me like the time before. Thanks to my wonderful husband, he kept me calm.My husband and I eventually turned off our notification until everybody cleared out.  When it was all said and done, we reviewed all the footage. There were some concerning things we picked up on. The kid with the dog from previous situations had ran up to the door staring into the camera with a bat in his hand. Two older boys nearly missed being hit by a passing van. They were chasing after a soccer ball that rolled into the street. One lady in HNICs driveway started calling to the boys to watch out. Lastly, baseball bat kid intentionally knocked down a toddler while they were playing soccer. In the final videos the ringleader finally showed face standing at the edge of the driveway with their arms crossed staring at our camera.They seemed to look disappointed that they didn\\'t pull off the job.  While watching all of this all I could think was you all are so pressed to bother us when all we do is stay to ourselves that you all are willing to put your children in harms way just to get a reaction from us, how sad. \\n\\nSince this happened my husband has installed more no trespassing signs on the front, side, and column in front of the porch. We have not said anything to these people about it all. We were going to report it for the trespassing to leasing at first, but we know it will be shrugged off since violating our privacy and space doesn\\'t seem to matter to anyone but us. My husband encouraged me to make this post about all of this to see if anyone could give any advice about what we\\'ve been experiencing. Of course, we will continue to document as needed but at this time calling the police Is not an option. That just leaves us with the civil approach but we know the burden of proof would be on us. Yes, we have proof but nothing violent towards us out right. We no that to others everything will look like kids just playing and adults just retrieving their children. No one will see the malintent that hides under all this. If not poor intentions then why all the smirks and weird smiles when they see us. \\n\\nIf you made it this far, thank you for reading!

Wilson  \\n(Excerpt from Over Coming Fears and Nightmares )\\n\\nHow we can use Dreaming for better mental health to fix cognitive atrophy, build better neural pathways and neurons, enhance higher-brain function, develop better memory and promote creativity.  Or if left unchecked, how being at the mercy of the wildness of the subconscious can cause negative replay in the form of nightmares causing long-term mental health problems. \\n\\nWe know that negative emotions and thoughts in the body release hormones like Cortisol that trigger a person’s bodies “alarm” system releasing adrenaline and putting them on edge. Fear also affects a person’s mental wellbeing and like much of the new neuroscience which is finding out more and more that there is a link to how we feel about ourselves and how our brain develops. Treating fear, phobias and nightmares is important to our mental health and should not to be treated like some joke because the consequences can lead to negative problems which can spiral out of control deepening depression, anxiety, stress, and even leaving a person more susceptible to disease. It also strips one’s ability to live a happy and positive life leading to chronic depression, a sense of hopelessness, anxieties and phobias.\\n\\nWe’ve talked about regions of the brain that deal with our dreams and memories. The part of the brain that deals with fear is a memory center that deals with our emotions called the Amygala. The Amygala also has motor outputs that link to a person’s heart and can change a person’s heart rate. It also contributes to producing sweat and produces the feelings of anxiety.\\n\\nThe Amygala works closely with the Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex and activates the pituitary gland. In chronic stress and fear the Amygala enlarges, the Hippocampus shrinks, the adrenal gland enlarges, the thymus and spleen lymph nodes shrink and can lead to gastric ulceration. A condition known as General Adaptation Syndrome and can leave the body susceptible to disease by depletion of neuroendocrine.\\n\\nThe impact on the hippocampus is loss of long-term memory loss and the prefrontal-cortex dampens creativity. By now we know that we build neural pathways to achieve specific learned tasks. The brain is neutral meaning it doesn’t decide how it will be wired because the person who is influencing and guiding the development of their brain is based on their subjective individual experiences and thoughts. If they start to develop a negative fearful personality, the negative consequences above start to shape their brain and personality enlarging the fear response and this leads to risk of phobias, personality disorders, schizophrenia and needs to be treated not left to deepen.\\n\\nSee “Stress effects on the hippocampus: a critical review” Eun Joo Kim, Blake Pellman, and Jeansok J. Kim https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4561403/#\\\\_\\\\_ffn\\\\_sectitle\\n\\nThe other side-effect is nightmares and night terrors. Quite often the underlying cause is something from waking life that causes PSTD (Post-traumatic stress disorder). PSTD isn’t limited to soldiers returning from war, this can happen in children who are abused both mentally and physically at a young age. PSTD can be caused from facing a life-or-death situation that results in injury of self or others such as a car accident or being in a violent confrontation. \\n\\nEven watching scary movies when a child is too young can lead to phobias such as fear of clowns and spiders. Programming a child through fear will also lead to developmental problems later such as lying to them that if they don’t stay in bed the boogie man will get them. Children are very susceptible to influences from their parent’s and as they haven’t developed a proper sense of what is imagined vs real and are the most prone to develop fears, phobias and nightmares in an unhealthy social environment.\\n\\nWhat we might think is innocent fun, telling a child about some irrational scary monster and encouraging fear development based on the neurological impacts is a form of mental abuse. Parents who want to control their children through fear buying into old archaic abuse systems are ultimately causing more harm to their children’s over-all development than parents who communicate and talk with their children taking a kinder approach to educate their children about risk, consequence and better choices so the child develops understanding. \\n\\nWhat happens? The child goes to bed and starts to have nightmares or even worse night-terrors. If left untreated by the parents ie, it’s just a dream and I don’t care. The child left alone to this problem must sort it out themselves, alone. The wrong way to deal with fear usually results in shutting down dreaming altogether as a defense mechanism to protect themselves from the barrage of wild negative hellish dreams.\\n\\nQuite often with people who deal with a lot of developmental issues around fear, stress, depression, anxiety don’t like dreaming. It’s not that dreaming is bad, but when programmed by an accumulation of negative thoughts and feelings that become the source material of the sensory episodic and semantic replay it can be like living in a horror filled movie of which one is constantly running away, having jump scares, replaying traumas, abuse and the core problems that started it all in the first place: Negative waking world influences and experiences that are now replaying in the dream state.\\n\\nCertain medicines are known to cause medication-induced nightmares such as Blood Pressure medications, Antidepressants (SSRIs), Antihistamines, Sleep Aids, Steroids and more. This can be treated if they are prescribed medicines by the doctor adjusting the time and dosage that they take. If substance use and medicines become too severe, they can cause something known as Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder.\\n\\nNot everyone responds well to certain street drugs where some may have a positive effect, others may unlock and deepen mental health disorders like fear and paranoia from taking them. Marijuana, Cocaine, LSD, Magic Mushrooms, Alcohol, Opioids, Bath Salts and many more have potentially harmful and negative effects on certain people if not most depending on the severity of the substance. \\n\\nMind altering and mood-altering drugs are often short-term benefits with long term consequences that develop problems over time such as addictions, dependencies and both mental health issues and physical diseases. The impact of the dreaming mind can be nightmares resulting from substance abuse as the cause.  Therefore, these courses do not, and will never encourage the use of any stimulant, drug or experimental supplement for dreaming. We leave the medical advice up to experience medical practitioners and doctors familiar with treating mental-health disorders through pharmaceutical treatments that are known to work. \\n\\nQuite often when I talk about the “Art of Dreaming” where I am talking about painting the blank canvas of our REM screen with our thoughts and experiences gained during the day by simple acts of observing waking life experiences. Many people bring up Carlos Castaneda who wrote “The Art of Dreaming” and think this is what I am promoting, to be clear… absolutely not. Carlos started his journey investigating Peyote, a hallucinatory entheogen which sparked a big drug movement for dreaming during the Woodstock era. \\n\\nHere is a fact some of these people don’t realize. Carlos found out later from Don Juan that they he didn’t need to take drugs to dream. In the beginning, it was Carlos who convinced Don Juan to let him try peyote and Don Juan reluctantly gave in to that request. Carlos wanted to take drugs, Don Juan advised against it, so remember that if someone uneducated in his work tries to promote drug use for dreaming citing his work to do so is likely not seeing the bigger picture and the bigger problems.  \\n\\nDrugs are not a pathway to a person’s already existing 3-5 dreams they have each night and can have life-altering negative side-effects if abused or managed improperly. Many entheogens can deepen fear in some people and even risk bringing out permanent psychological disorders and there are many scientific studies with peered reviewed evidence to support that as literal fact. To be clear, we do not endorse, encourage or promote the use of drugs when it comes to dream development with these courses or on this website. \\n\\nMany drugs can be the cause of nightmares that people may want to treat.  Ultimately a choice must be made for people who use drugs that must come to the honest conclusion of their negative impact on their dream life if nightmares are a cause. That person needs to look at the reality of what damage drugs do and be honest with themselves about their impact on their daily lives if the drug has formed dependencies, addictions and force them to self-justify always using them regardless of the self-destructive properties of some drugs. \\n\\nLike any positive change, people who face their problem, seek help and start supporting better long term sustainable mental and physical health recover. Those that do not can have dire consequences later such as depression, anxiety disorders, social problems that can lead to suicide, homelessness, psychotic breaks resulting in harming others and the list goes on.\\n\\nSubstance-Induced Nightmares cannot be treated by this course alone because the cause is drug related and the use of the drug must be first addressed. There are techniques offered in this course that “*may help*”, but if the cause of nightmares are linked to substance use then that person may need more help then what can be offered in an online course designed to turn dreaming into an Art Form and Entertainment System. \\n\\nIf substance use is the cause, the correct course of action for that person is seeking help and treatment first. This should be done through professional health care providers that specialize in treating drug addictions and mental health issues as the first step. Working on resolving nightmares through learning to control how one dreams can work in conjunction with treatment but should be now closely monitored by a health care practitioner who understands how substance use causes Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder and Substance-Induced Nightmares.\\n\\nAs everyone is different, and there is case-by-case level treatment that is needed for many mental health issues that stem from PSTD, early child-hood abuse, drug use and even harmful fear-based beliefs that deepen from early childhood exposure to a source of endless fear.  Dreams “*may be*” helpful with some of these challenges, but for deeper rooted problems it never hurts to seek counseling, professional help to deal with the deeper emotional problems and challenges. \\n\\nI cannot make any claim that this course is solution to all our mental health issues – a nightmare cannot be easily treated without first addressing the source or cause. Quite often they stem from something very negative in a person’s life. Others, it could be just an addiction to horror movies. Everyone is individual having gained experiences that shape a psychological model of how people view themselves and the world they live in. This ultimately will shape their dreams.\\n\\nDreams alone are not adequate to treat real-life problems because an untrained dreamer may reinforce and deepen fear rather than face and resolve them. Dreams are the result of waking life influences impacting episodic and semantic memory replay, not the cause of those influences. But the ability to dream can be damaged by negative waking life influences. Saying dreaming is the cause of mental health issues without addressing the source from waking life is quite irrational. The dream encoded by those waking life issues is what is trying to resolve itself to prevent further damage to a person’s psychological wellbeing. It’s how an individual uses their naturally ability to dream that determines the positive or negative outcome of said dream experience.\\n\\nTaking a positive, fun and entertaining approach towards dreaming is likely already helping resolve some underlying fears. We know that negative thoughts have the potential of developing long term psychological problems and positive thoughts lead to better mental health, brain development and over all wellbeing. But this alone is not enough for some people. Combined with eating for nutrition, exercise, managing stress, blowing off steam all work to release, and reverse damage caused by the negative alternatives that created the problem in the first place are some options. Dreams can help facilitate many of our challenge areas by providing creative solutions to resolving these issues as they do become stored episodic and semantic memories that replay in our dreams and over time can be released and resolved if one works to accomplishing that goal.\\n\\nNightmares are usually early signs of a fear acquired in waking life that a person’s subconscious mind is trying to resolve. They are an experience from the past, that no longer has relevance to the present moment but are made current only by the reoccurring episodic and semantic replay caused by persistent reinforcement of that underlying fear. Left untreated, it leads to paranoia, phobias and other health issues so making the first step to face one’s fears and resolve them is the right step. Leaving them to fester and build will affect how people think about themselves and the world around them.  If they constantly draw upon those negative influences and there are negative consequences on their brain and body as a result of letting fear go unchecked and unmanaged.\\n\\nFortunately, most people rationalize themselves out of fear before it becomes a problem. We outgrow childhood nightmares and reconcile these problems naturally. People who are avid dreamers try to avoid things that promote fear and control the waking world influences that might shape fear in the first place by focusing on positive, rewarding and pleasant influences. They turn their dream life into something positive, fun and rewarding and nightmares become a thing of the past.\\n\\nSince fear is often an intellectualized survival-drive instinct that has become imbedded with an over-protective sense of self-preservation from a strong emotional response it embeds a learned pattern into the mind to deal with often a simple negative response to a stimuli ie… the root cause. The waking world is where all the consequences happen. The dream world is just a mind-generated narrative that has zero consequences to the one having the dream. Being bitten by a spider in real life is bad, a spider bit from a dream has no physiological ramifications whatsoever. You just wake up maybe feeling a little scared of a harmless experience.\\n\\nIt's when we associate survival mechanisms that are there to protect us in our consequential waking life where physical harm in our daily life is real, these same mechanisms when present in the dream state are nothing more than simulated role-play and are fundamentally harmless but believe it or not, in the case of nightmares and night-terrors they can cause the same damage that fear can cause in waking life.\\n\\nFear in dreams are a psychological coping mechanism to waking life self-preservation and the mind knows that irrational fear needs to be resolved so it plays back the irrational fear but this is the enigma of this problem. In saying dreams are entirely harmless is a little fallacious because when a nightmare plays out and you engage the drama with fear, it has similar effect to fear in our waking life from a neurological standpoint causing a physiological effect on both the brain and body.\\n\\nThe amygdala response as if the event in the dream is real, while sleeping a person’s body will respond using the same mechanisms that take place from waking life when dealing with a real-life survival situation where fear is a mechanism of fight-or-flight. The body begins to prepare itself to fight-or-flight even though the person is sleeping, and the simulation of the nightmare is effectively harmless. The neurological and physiological responses however are not.\\n\\nThe neurological response and process starts with the Amygala that sends a response to the hypothalamus which activates the pituitary gland where the nervous system engages the endocrine system to release hormones. The pituitary gland releases andrenocorticotropic (ACTH) hormones into the blood. This causes the sympathetic nervous system that regulates the flight-or-flight response a surge of epinephrine from the adrenal gland into the blood stream. This activates Cortisol response to the ACTH which causes blood pressure to rise and converts fatty acids into energy for muscular response. Several other hormones prepare the muscles to take action if needed.\\n\\nThe hippocampus and prefrontal cortex activate to assess the threat which will now either overpower the primal parts of the brain’s response ie calm down the amygdala or elevate the response if the person believes the threat is real, even if it’s entirely fictional ie a scary movie or a dream.\\n\\nThe physiological response is increased the heart rate, peripheral blood vessels constriction around vital organs. Epinephrine, norepinephrine and catecholamine release can boost heart rate and heavy breathing. Reduces activity in the Stomach and Intestines and dampens other sensory systems like vision and hearing.\\n\\nIf the fear isn’t dampened down, and the person continues to elevate their response and not rationalize it down, there is a bundle of fibers connected to the cerebellum called the pyramis that cause fear paralysis in people and in animals. The night-terror level fear response.\\n\\nTherefore, people wake up in terror, heart racing, breathing heavily and sweating when faced with a powerful nightmare that is stimulating the same neurological and physiological response in the sleeping body. As we know, this leads to negative neural pathways and neuron development by stimulating the wrong regions of the brain enlarging the Amygala and shrinking the hippocampus causing long-term memory loss and other problems.\\n\\nSee “Dissecting terror: How does fear work?” [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323492.php#9](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323492.php#9)\\n\\nIn treating phobias, health practitioners know that the sooner it is resolved the easier it is to treat, the longer it begins to embed itself ie build deeper neural pathways and becoming a hard-wired learned response the more difficult it may become to treat. Why some people shut down their ability to dream maybe linked to the mind protecting itself from replay that causes an unnecessary fear response in the body. All of the negative effects of fear on the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex could be throwing up a survival-drive defense mechanism against nightmare-based replay. This is just a theory as many people end up walking away from dreams later in life. Nightmares are likely a root cause of that abandonment, or at the least one of the likely candidates.\\n\\nHow do we resolve nightmares then if our dreams have been riddled with this negative side of the dream experience? All our fears stem from our waking world influences. There are different sources of fear that require different methods to cope with and treat.\\n\\n· Fully Rational Fear Responses\\n\\n· Semi-Rational Fear Responses\\n\\n· Irrational Fear Responses\\n\\n**Fully Rational Fear Response**  \\n In the real world, people face life-or-death situations that trigger a proper fight-or-flight response from being in a war, being attacked, being abused, being in an accident, dealing with traumatic events, dealing with death of a loved one or pet and the list goes on. Children raised in abusive homes are most prone to problems with fear. All these real-world events that require fight-or-flight are legitimate times when fear is real. Some of these events can be so tragic, so traumatic that post-traumatic stress syndrome develops, or long periods of grief are required. These are the most challenging and difficult to work through and dreams are notoriously and seemingly cruel for replay on traumatic events. Research studies on dreams and PSTD and grieving do show positive improvements as the repeat simulations appear to help work through the past trauma and experience.\\n\\nSee *“Dreams Can Heal Mental Wounds”* https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/12/dreams-can-heal-mental-wounds/249672/\\n\\nIn the cases of a genuine real fear response to a survival situation and you are one of the people who suffer from PSTD or other complex deeply embedded issues caused from such events, you are likely already working through treatment. If you are slugging through it on your own and still need to work your way out of the fear that it may have embedded it is better to work through this in a support group, or with proper medical mental health practitioners because it is a past-event that cannot be changed and having survived through it shouldn’t rob you of a better today by constant replay while awake or asleep. \\n\\nThe replay is dreams is there to help you work through trauma bit by bit until it’s gone but can backfire and deepen the problem if the response feeds the fear in the replay. Trauma and fear can be deeply embedded that dreaming alone not be enough to resolve, recover and move on. Dreaming may help, it may not.   \\n \\n\\nMuch of the advice that follows is better suited to semi-rational and irrational fears and potentially can help with deeper problems, but I don’t make any claim, nor falsely promise that it will as each individual is different and how we cope is subjective. Like anything, time heals, it takes time to work through a healing process towards recovery.  If I can at least help make dreaming fun and entertaining then that’s something better to look forward too with sleep.\\n\\nIn case-by-case situations the severity of the fear and trauma may need professional help and this course is not designed to fulfill such a deep requirement for those people in need. Wish it could, but it’s a course on dreaming for entertainment not resolving PSTD and trauma. Need to be honest with the audience as to not raise some false expectation. Using dreams as an Art Form and Entertainment system as a skill is achievable regardless of any experience as it’s merely learning to do something based on study, practice and routine with something everyone does when they sleep including animals. Quite often, fun and pleasant dreams are helpful for people suffering from other negative events in their lives so that may be of some benefit. \\n\\nDealing with semi-rational and irrational fear responses is more suitable for the advice that is offered such as a fear management program when the fear is not real or at all life-threatening. \\n\\n**Semi-Rational Fears**  \\n A semi-rational fear responses can come from harmless events such as seeing a spider crawl across the floor but responding to the spider with fear rather than rationalizing that one can do far more harm to the spider than the spider can do to them. Survival-drive instincts are part of us. Nature has already pre-loaded us up with things to be afraid of in nature so from a primal survival drive instinct thus it’s not to uncommon for a spider to trip that survival instinct. That is a semi-rational fear response and yes it’s ok to be afraid of a spider. But even better to manage that fear and not let it become a phobia.\\n\\nEven though a spider may be dangerous, it is fundamentally likely harmlessly going about it’s business making the fear semi-rational meaning the person recognizes a potential risk, but the risk isn’t direct ie… the spider is biting them or on them and they are at zero-risk of injury. So the choice is to either dampen or elevate the fear response.   \\n\\nThe rational choice in that situation would be to dampen the fear response and rationalize away the irrational components of the fear ie making the spider more of a threat than it is. That is what embeds the fear deeper, so the next time a spider is observed, the mind replays the elevated response deepening it again, and again, and again if the person doesn’t rationalize away the fear and dampen the response. This repeat replay of fear deepens neural pathways and neurons as a learned behavioral response that then leads to a phobia.\\n\\n**Irrational Fear Response**\\n\\nAn irrational fear responses occurs when there is absolutely no threat what so ever and the fear is entirely mental role-play over something that triggers this response. The stimulant can still trigger the flight-or-fight mechanism such as a jump scare video, a horror movie or even someone planting a fear in someone else convincing them of a fictious threat like a boogie man is in the closet to scare a child to stay in bed. Seems harmless enough if one doesn’t understand the dangers of cognitive development with regards to developing learned responses to fear. Once understood, it’s likely another alternative solution to controlling a child’s behavior is used rather than abuse through irrational fear programming.\\n\\nIn certain scenarios, it is replaying a fear repeatedly in one’s mind that is starting the self-programming towards further problems. In a semi-rational or irrational fear event, a person needs to adopt a fear management program to nip the fear in the but at source before it becomes an embedded event for replay.\\n\\nOne tested method has always been rationalizing through fear and not feeding the fear ie… don’t elevating a response, calm the mind down, tell yourself you are ok. If the fear pops up in the mind again, tell yourself you acknowledge the fear, there is no current threat, let the fear go and replace it with something positive as in, “I’m not afraid of that. That’s just a silly and irrational fear”. Do this at source and this positive self-programming over-time will be a natural response to the harmless but bothersome moments of irrational fear.\\n\\nUsing positive reinforcement is sometimes needed. Knowing what you now know about how fear impacts mental and physical health, is developing a proper fear management program to stop a fear at source and do some house-cleaning to disarm and let go any minor semi-rational and irrational fears over time a good or bad idea? \\n\\nFor past fear management, take a moment to look at when a fear took place, notice the emotional charge in the body? That is the first to address the charge, you need to let that go by diminishing it, calming it down and then letting it go reinforcing calmly that you are ok, everything is fine and you won’t let that fear carry forward into your future as a repeat response. Don’t feed fear, resolve it the moment it creeps up. Do some house-cleaning and fear management or … pay the consequences. Be more afraid of what fear is doing to your mental and physical health than the fear itself. And always say to yourself, “I’m not afraid!” A little courage goes a long way in the never-ending bombardment of waking life fear influences.\\n\\nWhat you don’t want to do is embed the fear by self-programming, “I’m scared of it!” that’s the downward spiral to feeding fear especially if it’s semi-rational and irrational where no harm is done. If harm is done then the fear is legitimate or if it saved your life by making you run away from a dangerous situation. That is what fear is designed to do, keep you alive and safe but our developed intellectual mind can over-rationalize fear to some pretty elevated and unnecessary states.\\n\\nThe other area for fear management if you are prone to fear is managing waking life influences that may expose you to something unpleasant. We talk about garbage in = garbage out with dream content. Many people don’t watch horror movies because it gives them nightmares. They automatically have a fear management plan stopping a potential influence from adding more material for the subconscious mind to scare them with. This isn’t a bad method.  There are other people who don’t respond to horror movies because the irrational fear response is recognized ie, it’s not real, just a movie and don’t embed a emotional response that needs to be let go. Remember, everyone is different, but each person has their own coping mechanism with regards to fear.\\n\\nAs we dream based on waking life experiences spending more time on happy, positive and joy filled entertainment that will replay in your dreams. Some people need that if fear becomes a problem. There are others who can handle irrational fears saving survival-drive fears for real life-threatening moments like having a gun pointed to their head or ducking from a random object flying in ones direction. There is a time and place for fear to do it’s job. And that is in the real world, where there are real world consequences and threats.\\n\\nWould you rather rationalize through a fear while awake, or face that fear in a dream as some form of nightmare? It carries over to the dream state if it’s not resolved first as a waking life influence while awake. And if it does carry over into the dream state, you’ve already been developing an entire system that lets you set aside fears, anxieties and concerns programming the dream for positive artistic and entertaining feedback. At least… if a person stays the disciplined, practices and doesn’t doubt, ignore and distract themselves with negative patterns and irrational thoughts towards their own dreaming process.\\n\\nCertain nightmares may have already surfaced but now that you are more self-aware with regards to how you are dreaming you my have already dismissed them or resolved them in favor of better dreaming. Developing dream control is a weapon against any nightmare for the self-aware dreamer. Knowing you are the one creating, directing and controlling the dream content is where hacking down bad dreams becomes fun and entertaining. Make a game out of it, and level yourself up kicking fear in the ass where it belongs. It belongs here as a survival-drive mechanism but has no place in your dreams unless you want it too. \\n\\nIf the fear is so deep it triggers fight-or-flight mechanisms during sleep as a chronic nightmare, dreams are generally safe and harmless. The goal is to prevent any dream from becoming so severe that it triggers a physiological response and fear is likely the only use-case where this will happen. Positive dreams likely have the same positive response on the body during sleep. They can be euphoric, blissful, erotic, fun, exciting and much more if used for those purposes.\\n\\n7.7 billion people sleep and dream 3-4 dreams each night, how many of those people today have died from a dream. Unless there was some serious medical condition already predisposed in there body where a scary dream may in the absolute most rare and extreme condition trigger a heart-attack, it would be far less than all the people dying from gun violence, opioid addictions, car accidents and other real life situations. I don’t doubt that there are likely a few cases in our history where a dream triggered a heart attack in a person already predisposed medically for that due to activation of the fight-or-flight mechanism. Chances are if the same mechanism triggered in waking life the result would have been the same. But I would need to see some cases to support that theory so far, I’m not aware of cases where dreaming resulted in death. I can certainly cite nearly endless of cases where war, famine, diseases, fires, accidents, and violence have.\", 'comments': []}, {'title': 'Table of Contents', 'subreddit': 'WannaWriteSometimes', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/WannaWriteSometimes/comments/i94f7e/table_of_contents/', 'selftext': '[MAGIC IS REQUIRED](https://www.reddit.com/r/WannaWriteSometimes/comments/it89x9/magic_is_required/)  \\\\---  Non-magic people are outlawed.
