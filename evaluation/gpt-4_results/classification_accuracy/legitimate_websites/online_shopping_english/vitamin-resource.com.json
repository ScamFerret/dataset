In winter, your legs may feel cold due to decreased blood circulation and exposure to cold temperatures. During this season, blood vessels constrict and reduce blood flow to the extremities, leading to cold sensations in the legs. The combination of lower temperatures and limited blood supply affects the body’s ability to keep the legs warm. Additionally, inadequate insulation or insufficient clothing can exacerbate the issue. The issue of cold legs in the winter may be resolved by being aware of the underlying reasons and taking the necessary action, such as dressing warmly and maintaining an active lifestyle. By improving blood circulation and keeping the legs insulated, you can ensure more comfort during the colder months. Health Disorders Health Tips Why Do My Ankles Itch When I Stand?

Exercise What Causes Little Round Balls in Poop A healthy bowel movement consists of well-formed, sausage-shaped stools that are easy to pass. However, when the diet lacks fiber, the stool becomes hard and difficult to pass, leading to the formation of small, round balls in the poop. This can be uncomfortable and may also indicate an inadequate intake of dietary fiber. Fiber plays a crucial role in adding bulk to the stool, which helps it retain water, making it softer and easier to pass. When the body lacks fiber, the stool becomes compacted and takes on a pellet-like form. We will investigate the reasons behind little round balls in poop, providing helpful insights for individuals who may be experiencing this condition. Urinary Problems Why Do I Pee So Much on My Period? On your period, hormonal shifts, namely an increase in prostaglandins, can lead to muscle contractions in the uterus, putting pressure on the bladder and causing the urge to urinate more frequently. Additionally, water retention and bloating can further contribute to the need to urinate more often. Knowing the causes of increased urine throughout the menstrual cycle helps allay worries and reassure that it’s a typical aspect of the menstrual cycle. Women's Health Why Do My Legs Shake When I Poop? It may seem strange, but there’s actually a scientific reason behind legs shake when pooping. When you exert pressure on your body by straining your muscles during a bowel movement, it triggers a reflex called the Valsalva maneuver. This maneuver increases the pressure in your abdomen, which can lead to your legs shaking involuntarily. This could be concerning, but it’s a typical physiological reaction. We’ll look into the reasons behind this and offer some explanations for this strange phenomenon. So let’s get started!

Nutrition and Diet Why My Hands Shake When I am Hungry? Get Immediate Relief Now! When hungry, your hands shake due to low blood sugar levels causing a drop in energy supply to muscles. When you are hungry, a decrease in blood sugar levels occurs, leading to a lack of energy supply to the muscles. This results in the shaking or trembling of your hands. This phenomenon is commonly known as hand tremors or essential tremors, and it is a temporary condition that occurs due to the body’s response to low blood sugar levels. These tremors are involuntary and can affect your daily activities, making it difficult to perform tasks that require steady hand movements. We’ll look at the causes of your trembling hands when you’re hungry and talk about treatments and prevention options.

I don\\'t know if it\\'s my wording, an issue of semantics, some language barrier or what exactly but I think the point of my post has been lost. B12 is an essential nutrient. It is not found naturally in plant sources. If you eat vegan you need to supplement it one way or another, either via pills, tablets, or shoots, regularly eating fortified foods everyday, via injections... But you need to do it. If there\\'s no source of B12 in your intake, you WILL run into a deficiency sooner or later. And B12 deficiencies are no laughing matter.\\n\\nAnecdotal evidence is not science, so here\\'s a series of resources written by MDs and nutritionists where you can learn more about B12 on a vegan diet:\\n\\n* [Vitamin B12](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/), Jack Norris RD\\n* [Vitamin B12: A Vegan Nutrition Primer](https://www.theveganrd.com/vegan-nutrition-101/vegan-nutrition-primers/vitamin-b12-a-vegan-nutrition-primer/), Ginny Kish Messina, MPH, RD\\n* [Vitamin B12](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-b12/), Michael Greger, MD\\n* [Adequate Vitamin B12 on a Plant Based Diet](https://www.pickuplimes.com/article/adequate-vitamin-b12-15), Sadia Badiei, Nutritionist and Dietitian\\n\\nAlso relevant: [Vitamin B12 Recommendations: Updated](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12-recommendations-updated/) and [What Every Vegan Should Know About B12. An Open Letter From Health Professionals and Vegan Organizations](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12/what-every-vegan-should-know-about-vitamin-b12/).\\n\\nI can\\'t quote stuff directly right now because Reddit is messing my formatting. But the takeaway from reading through those is that you NEED a reliable source of B12, supplements being typically recommended to avoid risk. Also because they are cheap, convenient, effective, and reliable.\\n\\nNeedless to say, do refer to your local nutritionist for questions about your diet. It\\'s also a good idea to get your blood work done every few months or once a year to make sure everything is in order, even if you do supplement.\\n\\nWhether it\\'s an adequate quantity of fortified foods of your choice daily or a supplement: TAKE IT. Do not play with your health because it\\'s extremely easy and cheap to avoid risking it.\\n\\n\\\\----Original post below----\\n\\nNo ifs or buts. Take it.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been vegan for 3 years with no supplements and I\\'m fine\" and you WILL develop a B12 deficiency if you keep that up.\\n\\nNooch and fortified plant milks are not consistent enough of a source.\\n\\nYou can get almost 2 years worth of B12 supplementation for like 20 bucks.\\n\\nIt\\'s extremely easy, cheap, and convenient to supplement it and you will avoid the hell that is B12 deficiencies. Don\\'t play with this.\\n\\nTake. The. Supplement.\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nSpeaking of: Buy the plant based milk that\\'s fortified with calcium, use iodized salt when cooking, and remember to include a source of omega3 in your daily diet (either using canola/grapeseed oil, walnuts, chia seeds, flax seeds, hemp seeds, etc). Just because you are vegan doesn\\'t mean you are immune to deficiencies.\\n\\nEdit 2: You CAN get enough B12 from fortified foods (which is another form of supplementation), but how reliable that is for most people is questionable. You need to be eating typically several servings of specific products to keep it up consistently.', 'comments': ['Thanks for posting to r/Vegan! &#128037;\\n\\n**Please note:** Civil discussion is welcome, trolls and personal abuse [are not](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/rules).

The Bill will replace the current Medicines Act 1981, Dietary Supplements Regulations 1985, and other minor acts like the Sunscreen Act 2022. The purpose of the Bill is to protect and improve the health of all New Zealanders by regulating therapeutic products across their lifecycle. The Bill will require therapeutic products to receive market authorisation before being imported, exported, or supplied in New Zealand. The Bill also regulates controlled activities related to therapeutic products, including manufacturing, supply, exporting, clinical trials, and advertising restrictions. A Therapeutic Products Regulator will be established to oversee these regulatory matters.\\n\\nOverall this looks to me like a good bill that fixes many flaws in the current Medicines Act.

One common misconception I noticed was people arguing that supplements (natural or otherwise) are proactive, preventative, fight sickness/disease, and/or always safe; therefore, they should have no regulation. Of course, this isn’t true, but maybe MPs will believe it if enough people repeat it. Looking at the science, most reviews investigating the use of supplements to reduce the risk of chronic diseases have shown little to no benefit, and some studies have also suggested possible risks associated with certain supplements. Here’s what I found:\\n\\n[Effects of Nutritional Supplements and Dietary Interventions on Cardiovascular Outcomes](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M19-0341) (2019):\\n\\n*“Use of omega-3 LC-PUFA and folate supplementation could reduce risk for some cardiovascular outcomes in adults. Combined calcium plus vitamin D might increase risk for stroke.”*\\n\\n[Supplemental Vitamins and Minerals for CVD Prevention and Treatment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109718345601?via%3Dihub) (2018):\\n\\n*“Conclusive evidence for the benefit of any supplement across all dietary backgrounds (including deficiency and sufficiency) was not demonstrated; therefore, any benefits seen must be balanced against possible risks.”*\\n\\n[Vitamin and Mineral Supplements for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2793447) (2022):\\n\\n*“Vitamin and mineral supplementation was associated with little or no benefit in preventing cancer, cardiovascular disease, and death, with the exception of a small benefit for cancer incidence with multivitamin use. Beta carotene was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer and other harmful outcomes in persons at high risk of lung cancer.”*\\n\\n[ADVERSE EFFECTS OF NUTRACEUTICALS AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380172/) (2017):\\n\\n*\"However, they are not necessarily safe for everybody. Like regular drugs, supplements with active ingredients that provide a physiological or pharmacological effect are likely to also cause adverse effects in susceptible individuals.

It\\'s honestly incredibly disappointing to see the reactions of people in here towards people who come in here asking questions on how to reduce the packaging waste when eating meat and then they\\'re just told, \"Don\\'t!\"\\n\\nWhen someone comes in here asking how to get plastic-free toilet paper, no one tells them to just not use it. When someone asks how to get plastic-free makeup, they get DIY recipes and plastic-free brands. When someone asks how to get plastic-free body wash, they\\'re given a bunch of soap brands.\\n\\nBut when someone asks about plastic-free meat? Suddenly, twenty people jump in and just say, \"By eating meat you cannot be zero waste.\" But guess what? By eating vegetables, you cannot be zero waste, either, unless you are growing 100% of your diet in your backyard garden.\\n\\nQuinoa is probably flown to your grocery store from Peru, meaning massive carbon emissions in every bite you eat. Do you advise people to cut it out? Almonds are grown in California, a place historically plagued by drought, meaning the water required to sustain those trees puts a ton of strain on the local water systems. Will you stop eating them?\\n\\nNot to mention, you *cannot* get 100% of your vitamin needs from a vegan diet - even [the vegan society](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/vitamin-b12/what-every-vegan-should-know-about-vitamin-b12) recommends taking vitamin B12 supplements if you are vegan, and those aren\\'t zero waste either! They mostly come in plastic bottles and must be shipped to your location from production facilities, meaning they cannot be zero waste. \\n\\nNow, I\\'m not going to argue that meat production isn\\'t responsible for a *massive* amount of carbon emissions. However, I *am* going to argue that by writing off the majority of the population\\'s diet as completely incompatible with the desire to reduce waste, you are throwing out the baby with the bathwater and being a *massive* hypocrite. If you\\'re not willing to suggest going to a local butcher or farmer\\'s market for meat with less packaging, you also shouldn\\'t be willing to suggest vitamin b12 supplements or almonds or quinoa because *nothing is perfect and you\\'re just turning people away from the community.* Not to mention that there are people with allergies or dietary restrictions that means they cannot healthily go vegan, and that [the rise of veganism is strongly correlating with a rise in malnutrition](https://theconversation.com/vegan-diets-are-adding-to-malnutrition-in-wealthy-countries-107555) in western countries, and that someone else\\'s dietary choices are frankly none of anyone else\\'s business.\\n\\nIn order to make a measurable difference, we need everyone to try imperfectly rather than just a few people to try perfectly. It is unrealistic to expect the entire world to flip a switch and become vegan. It\\'s also condescending and highly privileged to suggest that *anyone* can go vegan and that meat is a luxury that *anyone* can give up. If someone asks how to reduce their waste while eating meat, guess what - they eat meat. Sure, bring up a study showing the economic impact of meat production, but *also suggest something helpful* like going to a local butcher or reducing their intake. But don\\'t pretend you\\'re their doctor, don\\'t pretend that your lifestyle works for everyone, and stop telling people that if they\\'re not perfect, they\\'re not welcome.

A few weeks ago someone posted a ZW challenge worksheet calendar he received in school. Most of them were things reasonably attainable by a teenager in high school. Despite this, the vegan crowd dismissed it as garbage because it wasn’t “don’t eat meat” x28. Because clearly high school students have control over what is cooked and how families spend their money.\\n\\nThis kind of stuff isn’t really specific to this sub, though. Lack of social awareness and nuance is pretty much endemic to Reddit. “Do things my way or you are literally Hitler.”', 'There have been lots of studies that say a reduction in meat consumption across the board is one of the main ways we can (globally) eat sustainably. You are right there are  reasons people may not be able to in various ways to cut out meat or animal products completely but reduction is the most important aspect. In every area of moving towards zero waste when you ask yourself \"how do I reduce waste in X\" the first answer should ALWAYS be \"do I even need to consume X\". After that you can then think about ways to consume it more sustainably and without waste and only then think about how to deal with the waste that consuming X produces. I don\\'t think this community here is any more \"anti meat\" than \"anti consumerism\" or \"anti stuff\" in general.', 'I\\'m not going to address every point you make, because that would be exhausting. However, I will say, in reference to your point about supplements: the animals you eat are also supplemented. We took a walk in a rural area a few weeks ago and near a farm saw packaging for various salt licks and concentrated feed blowing around in the wind; this is usually shipped from factories in plastic. Then there are the vaccines and medicines used. Even the meat you buy nicely packaged in paper from your lovely local butcher may have been shipped there in plastic. Given the larger amount of crops required to feed farmed animals than to feed humans directly, there will almost always be more plastic, fuel, pesticides etc. involved.\\n\\nAs another example: [A lot of the material making up the \"great pacific garbage patch\" is fishing gear.](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/03/great-pacific-garbage-patch-plastics-environment/)\\n\\nAnd that article you linked has a very misleading headline. They don\\'t provide any evidence of a correlation with a rise in malnutrition, as you claimed.\\n\\nI agree that it\\'s not helpful try and outdo each other, it\\'s impossible to be completely zero-waste and any improvements we can make are better than none. However, it\\'s demonstrably true that using no or fewer animal products is better for the environment overall.\\n\\n&#x200B;', \"Firstly, the attitude you're talking about isn't exclusive to meat. There are definitely people on this sub who advocate forgoing all of your examples. On the toilet paper threads, you'll see people who recommend ditching toilet paper and using bidets and reusable cloth wipes instead. On makeup threads, there are usually responses from people who've stopped wearing makeup altogether. And with body wash and shampoo, there are occasionally comments from people who say they've gone soap-free and wash solely with water, along with more than a few comments suggesting nopoo. \\n\\nAdditionally, the impacts of quinoa and almond production are mentioned on the sub every so often, and when they are, you usually see people suggestion lower-impact alternatives! \\n\\nThat being said, none of the examples you gave have near the environmental impact that meat production and consumption does. And, when threads about reducing waste when buying meat come up, there are always comments about using your own reusable container, buying local from a butcher, and, shocker, reducing your consumption in general. \\n\\nI'm not sure what exactly you're looking for? What do you want people to say? Should they not mention the effects of meat eating on a sub that is made for discussing and improving the negative effects of consumption?\", 'If you\\'re just interested in a plastic-free lifestyle, go for it. But most people on here and other environmentally oriented forums will be thinking in broader terms, and for you to ask \"how can I marginally reduce the environmental impact of this massively wasteful thing I like to do\" is going to invite glib answers.
