So my boyfriend trying to help this friend , called this broker guy up from another number with the pretext that he wanted to see a flat. Both of them left on the sting operation now.\\n\\nUpon reaching, the friend stayed a bit far away from the meeting point. My boyfriend went to see the flat. The friend took the Scooty of the broker and hid it some place farther. And after seeing the flat, they both nabbed the guy and asked him to send the money then and there, or else he won’t get his vehicle. Broker guy yielded and sent back the 20k. And now they are returning back his Scooty. It’s happening right now as I type it.\\n\\nJust sending out tips to never give them the money before hand or before talking to owner and without a stamp paper agreement. And if you do by mistake, you can use this trick .\\n\\nEdit: Boyfriend came back and told me they got 5000rupees more from him as harassment charges. They took the Scooty at a place and gave him an hour to transfer the money or else they will hand over the Scooty to the policeHQ and file an official complaint. He said not to go forward with it or else he will commit s? It’s all captured in a video and is very messy\\n\\nEdit 1: A lot of people have commented that it was not the right legal way to have confronted him. Please suggest for general idea what could have been done in this situation? Please do not suggest going to the cops . It would have been impossible to have to solved that way.
