This is a good sign, as scam websites are often newly created and may not have a long history. The fact that the domain is registered until 2025 also indicates that the owners intend to continue using the domain, which is less common for scam sites. The registrar is 123-Reg Limited, which is a legitimate and well-known domain registrar. Based on these observations, it seems less likely that this is a scam website. However, I will perform one more check using social media to see if there are any reports of the site being a scam.",
