The website is operational, and although there is little information about the business from WHOIS and no social media activity, nothing suggests it is a scam.

The website is accessible with a status code 200, the text content doesn't show unusually low prices or suspicious claims, the WHOIS record shows it's a registered domain without any negative statuses, and the DNS records are properly configured. The lack of social media presence is not ideal but doesn't alone indicate a scam. The absence of SSL/TLS certificate information is a concern for data security but doesn't confirm a scam either.
