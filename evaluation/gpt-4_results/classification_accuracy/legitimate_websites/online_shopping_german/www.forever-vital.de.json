I don’t know what to do. Four months of illness, then “recovery”, and now deterioration. O2 levels are trash.

I tackle problems head on. I’m a professional researcher. I’m a problem-solver. I give my best effort every time.\\n\\nI got the bug in March, in NYC, at a time when no one knew what to do. So I managed it myself for two weeks, supplements, rest. After two weeks my dyspnea and trachycardia became too much to take, and I went to the hospital. They didn’t have many answers. Gave me two rounds of hydroxychloroquine (which we now know does more harm than good) and sent me home after 48 hours of stability.\\n\\nOver the following three months I rested and took care of myself. Towards end of May I felt well enough to start some small neighborhood walking. The relapses were minor. Then something changed in June. My dyspnea worsened, the tachycardia returned. A week ago I went to the ER unable to catch my breath, and observing periodic low oxygen. They did a CT, and once I was stable they sent me home - no answers, nothing fixed.\\n\\nLast night I woke up gasping. Today I walked *around the corner* and had my O2 drop to 85. Tomorrow I see a pulmonologist. My layman theories are either “hidden” and extensive lung damage, or the virus made its way into my central nervous system and is screwing with my vital functions.\\n\\nCheerful eh?\\n\\nI feel like I’ve read every emerging study, preprint, theory, I’ve pieced together everything I could, and I just don’t see a happy ending here. I’m still fairly young, living in one of the medical capitals of the world, and feel like my life has changed forever and I’ve fallen totally through the cracks.\\n\\nDon’t know what I’m looking for with this post. Maybe just catharsis. Thanks for reading.\\n\\n- - -\\n\\nUPDATE\\n\\nThank you everyone for the well-wishes, suggestions, rewards(!) and shared stories. Did not expect this many responses.\\n\\nToday I went to a pulmonologist and an internist. Not a lot of answers yet. We went through my CT and it was all pretty much fine. Little bit of scarring, but that’s normal for my age (40M). Micro-clotting is one theory, so I will be scheduling a v/q test. He agrees that de-conditioning is a factor (being out of shape from recovery), but there’s still something else going on. The internist ordered a bunch of bloodwork, another ekg, another echocardiogram, and a pulmonary function test. So we’ll see how those go. Have another appointment with the disease specialist next week - he’s the guy whose brain I really need to pick. Meanwhile, post-viral inflammation continues to be another theory. I can tell you that after running around the city today, I feel worn out, flushed, and my heartrate has been 90 or more all day. Ordered some fish and veggies for dinner, and I plan to turn my brain off for the rest of the night - never underestimate the importance of mental health, too.\\n\\nWishing good health to all, stay safe out there. Sorry if I don’t reply to everyone.', 'comments': ['[deleted]', 'I’m sorry to hear that you’re dealing with this.\\n\\nI have asthma and a neurological condition called Dysautonomia, specifically POTS. I get tachycardia and dyspepsia quite a bit.\\n\\nYou’re seeing a lung doc tomorrow, so hopefully you’ll find out useful information. \\n\\nI’ve been on nearly every steroid inhaler and/or combination. Your doctor might prescribe a steroid inhaler. That you take once or twice and day. You should notice some difference, even a minor one, within 3-4 days. If it doesn’t work, get a different one. The only one that works for me is Advair. Symbicort (a competitor product) doesn’t work. A single steroid inhaler and prednisone doesn’t work. Every body is different, so pay attention to yours.\\n\\nThey will maybe prescribe albuterol. That is a rescue inhaler. It sounds like you probably want the nebulizer version of that. You can get a nebulizer machine for like $35 from CPAPmachine.com. If you have questions abo the specific one, feel free to DM me. Instead of getting albuterol in an inhaler, you’ll get ampules of liquid, pour it into the machine and inhale it for around 15 minutes at a time. It’s wayyyyy more affective. However, nebulizer are “open air” and will spread whatever bacteria you have. You shouldn’t be sick anymore so that shouldn’t be much of a concern. I’d recommend getting albuterol for the nebulizer treatment instead of simply an inhaler.\\n\\nNervous system stuff:\\nI’d recommend getting the cheapest Fitbit or heart rate tracking watch that is effective. I have a Fitbit Alta HR. It’s a few years old now. I bought it for $65. My heart rate spikes anytime I stand up because my body doesn’t work correctly. Trying to find a cause or relationship to heart rate spikes is useful. \\n\\nEverybody’s nervous system works best with sleep. The less we sleep, the harder our nervous systems have to work. On days that I get less than 6 hours of sleep, I’m far more likely to pass out.\\n\\nFor the tachycardia, I haven’t found something that makes it stop or slow down. The lung medications, especially steroids and/or stimulants can make tachycardia occur more frequently. That is something to be cognizant of.\\n\\nI am not a doctor, so I would also recommend discussing this with them. Your nervous system works best with a lot of salt and water. I am medically required to consume as much water as you safely can and take over the counter salt tablets daily. If you’re having other nervous system issues, you may want to look into those.\\n\\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to respond here or DM me.\\n\\nEdit: adding additional information on O2 readers. If your hands or fingers are cold, it may not be accurate O2. I don’t regulate temperature correctly so often they often can’t read for me at all.\\n\\nOne more edit: I’m not saying this to freak you out. I’m 29. I’ve been a medical marvel since I was 18. I finally got the answers I was looking for a year ago. It took 10 years and 30+ specialists. \\n\\nDoctors are amazing. Their job is incredibly difficult. We are very lucky to have them. But please don’t make the same mistake that I did. I thought that doctors knew better than me. They did their best but genuinely didn’t know. If you don’t fit into a mold, doctors often don’t know what to do and send you from specialist to specialist. COVID is still new so they may not know what to do. That would suck but is okay. \\n\\nYou are your own best advocate. Do not let anyone tell you that your symptoms are not real, not as bad as you’re experiencing, etc. Things are happening and they’re happening to you. If all tests (blood or otherwise) come back normal and they don’t know the cause, it’s still a problem that you need fixed. Just because they don’t know what is going on doesn’t mean you have to sit around and be miserable.', \"I don't have any answers, but I feel like i'm in the same situation.  Sick since mid-March, not quite normal but with some ups and downs was functional in May.  But the last 4 weeks have been an intense decline. I've only been trying to rest and just can't get past it this time.  SOB from the most minor of activities, chest pain & feels heavy, heart races from just walking between rooms in my house, exhaustion, cough. ER visit wasn't helpful.  Just waiting for the next test/dr visit at this point. Bloodwork mostly normal. Resting EKG was abnormal. Stress EKG was pretty much a disaster, huffing to breathe within the first minute, and the next day felt like my lungs were burning inside.  Echo seems normal.  Next week a lung function test, then a CT, and a cardiologist.  Hope your pulmonologist can give some answers, thinking of getting that scheduled too.

Yes, you heard it right, an absurd 80% fee that has transformed this once-promising platform into a grotesque parody of itself, akin to a zombie system straight out of a dystopian nightmare.\\n\\nIn the heydays of DeFi, enthusiasts flocked to its banner, enticed by the promise of financial liberation and autonomy. But alas, it seems the creators took inspiration from a different kind of liberation—North Korea's economic model. For what else but a regime utterly detached from reality would impose such exorbitant fees on transactions, effectively bleeding its users dry?\\n\\nImagine you're a hapless investor, looking to liquidate some of your assets on DeFiChain. You hit the sell button, only to find yourself greeted by a merciless 80% fee, leaving you with a mere pittance of your intended gains. It's akin to trying to squeeze blood from a stone, only the stone is your investment and the blood is your hard-earned money.\\n\\nAnd what of those who dare to resist this financial tyranny? They're swiftly met with the iron fist of censorship, their voices silenced and their dissent swept under the rug. For in the twisted realm of DeFiChain, criticism is not tolerated—it's crushed beneath the weight of authoritarianism.\\n\\nBut perhaps the most tragic aspect of this saga is the metamorphosis of DeFiChain into a zombie system, a hollow shell of its former self, devoid of innovation and vitality. Much like the isolated kingdom of North Korea, it exists in a state of perpetual stagnation, insulated from the winds of progress by its own misguided policies.\\n\\nSo, as we bear witness to the slow, agonizing demise of DeFiChain, let us not mourn its passing, but rather reflect on the lessons it imparts. For in its downfall lies a cautionary tale of unchecked greed, hubris, and the perils of straying too far from the principles of decentralization. Let us hope that future endeavors in the realm of decentralized finance learn from these mistakes, lest they too succumb to the same fate of becoming zombie systems, forever trapped in the shadows of their own folly.\\n\\n\", 'comments': []}]"
