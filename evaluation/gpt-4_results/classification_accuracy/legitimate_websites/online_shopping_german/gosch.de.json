Because this is a very controversial piece of evidence that gets referenced/brought up to support *both* sides of the argument, I decided it was worth doing a post about. I’m sorry if some parts are a little choppy; I finished it up in a rush and I’ll probably edit later to make it flow together easier. Sources and notes are in the comments.\\n\\nNote: I highly recommend you have some knowledge of this case and the possible connection to the Franklin Credit Union Scandal. It’ll make it easier to understand.\\n\\n**NARRATIVE**\\n\\nOn August 27, 2006, Johnny’s mother received an unmarked envelope at her front door that contained three photographs. [The color photo](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7065/364/1600/gosch%201.0.jpg) showed three fully clothed, prepubescent boys lying side-by-side on a bed, gagged with their ankles tied and wrists bound behind their backs. [Another featured one of the boys](http://www.johnnygosch.com/images/JT.jpg) - who Noreen believed to be Johnny - alone and lying on a bed, shirtless and bound/gagged. The third [showed a possibly deceased man with a ligature tied around his neck](http://www.johnnygosch.com/images/man.jpg). That same day, others connected to the case, including former Nebraska state senator John DeCamp, also received the pictures via email or postal. \\n\\nNoreen was immediately convinced that one of the boys was Johnny. She sent the photos to James Rothstein, a retired private detective from New York who had helped her in the past. Rothstein said Noreen, along with an unnamed child sex ring conspiracy theorist he knows and talk show host Michael Corbin, had sent him the photos on August 26th. ^a\\n\\n—\\n\\nOn September 13, 2006, the West Des Moines Police Department received an anonymous letter postmarked from Tampa that called the veracity of the pictures into question.^2\\n\\n> Gentlemen,\\n\\n> “Someone has played a reprehensible joke on a grieving mother. The photo in question is not one of her son but of three boys in Tampa, Florida about 1979 - 80, challenging each other to an escape contest. There was an investigation concerning that picture, made by the Hillsborough County (FL) Sheriff’s Office. No charges were filed, and no wrongdoing was established. The lead detective on the case was named Zalva. This allegation should be easy enough to check out.”^9\\n\\nThis led authorities to Nelson Zalva, an investigator at the Florida State Attorney’s Office, who told them the photos were actually from a case he investigated between 1978 and 1979.\\n\\nNelson Zalva was an investigator at the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office when the two photos of the children landed on his desk around 1979.^3 Someone - possibly one of the boys’ parents - had found them and notified the police, who began an investigation into their origins and whether any abuse had occurred. Zalva managed to identify the boys in the pictures, who explained they were taken by a man in the neighborhood who tied up the boys (with their consent) as part of an escape contest, and promised them fireworks in return. Which is a strange thing to do, but if his story is true, then it’s impossible for the boy in the picture to be Johnny Gosch.\\n\\nHowever, Zalva’s story has also been challenged, as he was forced to admit that the authorities still hadn’t been able to locate an incident report, any records pertaining to the case, or even proof that the photos were ever part of a case handled by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office.^4 To this day, the records have never been found, so the story told by Zalva and the anonymous letter writer cannot be confirmed. \\n\\nOn October 18, Zalva announced that, using the information in the letters, he had been able to track down and interview one of the boys (now an adult) in the photos.^5 In the interview, which allegedly took place on October 16, the man again confirmed the pictures had been taken consensually by a man in their northern Hillsborough County neighborhood.^5\\n\\nNoreen accused Zalva of lying and revealed that she had another photo of her son to prove it (although she didn't specify where or how she got it). She said she didn't share the photo with police because she didn’t trust their ability to investigate it, and that she expected to receive more pictures as her own investigation into Johnny's disappearance progressed.^6\\n\\nNoreen has long believed that her son was abducted by an organized pedophile ring, which branded its victims with a “rocking X” symbol. This symbol was first mentioned by Paul Bonacci, a man who, in 1992, claimed that he and three other men had abducted Johnny for the ring connected to the Franklin Credit Union in Lincoln, Nebraska. On the second photo, which shows a lone boy who Noreen believes to be Johnny, someone had circled a faint X-shape mark on his upper arm. \\n\\nAs of 2016, this aspect of Johnny’s case remains unsolved. The sender has never been identified. They boy in the picture has never been confirmed to be Johnny, and the apparently deceased man in the third picture also remains unidentified. The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office never found the files from the 1979 probe into the pictures. \\n\\n—\\n\\n**IS IT JOHNNY?**\\n\\nThis is the central question. The fact that Johnny’s own mother identified him is strong enough evidence for many people, but I’m not quite sure. \\n\\nJohnny was a very average-looking boy who didn’t really stand out physically. He had brown hair, blue eyes, an average build. The most distinguishing feature is a large birthmark on his chest, but that doesn't help much because the lone boy's legs are in front of his chest in the picture. That, along with the mediocre photo quality, makes it a little difficult for me to tell if it’s really Johnny. \\n\\nThey do appear to be the same age and of a similar build. The only thing is that the boy in the picture looks to be his age (11 - 12) while the Gosches have stated multiple times that Johnny appeared to be older than he really is (15 - 16 as opposed to a preteen).\\n\\n\\n**WHO SENT THEM TO NOREEN?**\\n\\nJudging from a local news report that showed the copies of the photos Noreen received, they seem to have been printed on regular printer paper. The fact that one of the photos was edited in MS Paint or a similar program to add text also suggests this.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this makes the pictures extremely difficult to track, and opens up the possibility that the letters were a hoax by a random stranger with no connection to the case. We know the photos were on various websites before August 2006, so anyone who visited those sites would have had access to those pictures. \\n\\nIt wouldn’t be the first time the Gosches were the victims of a prank or attempt to exploit them. For 34 years, they have been on the receiving end of dozens of prank phone calls, false ransom demands, attention seekers, and hoaxers attempting to exploit them for their own personal gain/satisfaction. In fact, in 1985, Noreen was scammed out of $11,000 by a fake private investigator who told her he needed the money to perform a covert operation to rescue Johnny from his captors.^10\\n\\nBut why did they send them to Noreen, and on her birthday no less? It could have been a sick joke. Or someone who wanted to torment Noreen. Did someone’s conscience get the better of them?\\n\\n\\n**MY OPINION**\\n\\nI lean towards the pictures being a hoax by a random sender.\\n\\nZalva comes off as credible to me, despite the Sheriff’s Office never being able to locate the files from the 1979 investigation. It sounds suspicious on its face, but considering how easily these records can get lost - especially back in the 70s when they were using index cards and paper as opposed to computerized records - it isn’t so strange. I wish we had more info on the interview he claims to have had on October 16, 2006.\\n\\nSo yeah. Is it Johnny in the pictures, who sent them to Noreen in the first place, and is there a connection to the Franklin scandal? I’d love to hear (well, read) you guys’ thoughts.\\n\\nEDIT: Corrected eye color. \", 'comments': ['**BIBLIOGRAPHY & FOOTNOTES**\\n\\nI worked almost completely from newspaper archives.

Noreen says that she first received the photos on the morning of Sunday, August 27, but the timestamp on the email she sent to James Rothstein said she actually sent it on the night of the 26th. When asked about this discrepancy, Noreen insisted she did receive them on the 27th. I didn’t include this info in the OP because we know she had no involvement in her son’s disappearance, so it’s not very relevant.', \"I've got one question about this case.  Who owned the damn two-toned Ford Fairlane?  WHO?  WHO?  GOD DAMN IT, THE GOD DAMN MOTOR VEHICLE DEPT. HAS THIS SHIT ON FILE!!!  Maybe it was tedious back then, when everything was a paper file, but I damn sure would have tried to look up every damn Ford Fairlane in the local area and work from there!  WTF!!\", \"I think it's a hoax, pictures probably taken from an online pedophile fetish site. Can't say why anyone would do it but I know some detective in Florida mentioned that the photos originated from there and they were not of Johnny - though I believe they could only truly identify two of the three boys. \\n\\nThere's a documentary out there called *Who Took Johnny* and in it they speak to his father who's convinced it's not Johnny in the photos. Johnny had a large birthmark on his chest, which isn't really there in any of the photos and his dad said he had bigger than average feet for his age/height, yet the boy in the photo appears to have average sized feet. It's clear he's not convinced, though his mom clearly is.\\n\\nI feel for her. She's obviously never accepted her son's disappearance and it's done its tole on her. Expected, though, as I can't imagine living with that reality. But I think she's kind of gone off the deep end, which is really sad. \\n\\nI always felt that Johnny was probably killed shortly after his kidnapping. Though, I'll say the story about the kid resembling Johnny in Colorado, who was branded, and living in the basement of a rural house does give me pause. I think one of the producers of America's Most Wanted followed up on the claims of someone who said he was with Johnny at the house and it checked out on the surface - there was a house in Colorado with a hidden basement where a bunch of boys names, purportedly of the sex slaved children living there, etched into the wood.\\n\\nBut nothing really ever came of it. They couldn't find much information on the previous owner of the house.\\n\\nWho knows if that really even happened or was a further ruse? But like I said, it did give me pause. The story of the boy who claimed to be in the same ring, and actually had the same branding of Johnny, matched that given by Paul Bonacci, who was serving time in prison but claimed to help kidnap Johnny for the pedophile ring. That boy, his name was Jimmy, I believe, came forward after it aired on AMW, discussed the house in Colorado, the branding  (which he too had as I explained) and a rock in the shape of an elephant - then went and showed the producers. Again, though, it could just be a sick joke being played on Noreen.\\n\\nOr it's being embellished by the producers of AMW. \\n\\nI also know that Paul received letters from other supposed boys who were in the ring, with one claiming the Col (colonel) skipped out to Mexico with Johnny and that's where they're living. \\n\\nWho the fuck knows, though? The whole thing is just crazy wired.\", 'On her website Noreen Gosch claimed on October 15th 2010 that the possibly deceased man in the photos (with the ligatures) had been identified. She says \"WE HAVE NOW IDENTIFIED THE MAN IN THESE PHOTOGRAPHS AND KNOW WHAT HE HAS DONE. IF ANYONE HAS INFORMATION ON \"DELTA\" PLEASE CONTACT\". Has anyone anymore information on this?', 'Poor Johnny Gosch was probably murdered hours after he was kidnapped.  The rest of this is a mother crushed into a shell by the crime and the years of frustration that followed.  The recent developments are callous assholes just torturing a family that is in perpetual suffering.']}]"

        "thought": "The extracted text from the legal notice (Impressum) page mentions \"Heine Delikatessen GmbH & Co. KG\" which seems to be a company associated with the GOSCH brand. However, the text does not provide detailed contact information such as an address, phone number, or email address that I can verify for appropriateness. At this point, I have not found any of the scam characteristics mentioned in the original instructions within the website or its shop subdomain. The website appears to be associated with a legitimate business offering fish, wine, and related products, and there are legal notices and terms and conditions present. Based on my observations and the lack of scam characteristics, I now know the final answer. The URL https://gosch.de/ does not appear to be a scam website.",
