Did not know it was that bad. My loan process (here in Finland) was different. The bank wanted to know salaries (and stability of work), prior loans and the loan period. Then they calculated how much of a monthly dent the payments make, just to determine if we can afford to live on top of that. When that was all okayed, we got a loan. Seems reasonable. Super super low interest.', \"The issue with credit scores is not so much that a score exists, for which I would tend to agree it is better as a whole for lenders to be able to assign a risk factor to borrowers, but rather the mechanics in how the score moves. **Credit scores have a lot of inertial forces that can bring it down, and not enough to bring it up.**\\n\\nCredit scores have several inflection point in their behavior, with the first range of values (300-700ish) being traced along the on time payment metric. Once you hit 100% on time payments, and maintain that behavior, your credit score will increase less and less as time goes on, ultimately reaching a plateau where your score won't change at all. This will be somewhere around the ballpark of 700-750.\\n\\nAt a certain point, to push it past 750, you have to start taking out larger and more lines of credit, like a home or car loan, or business starter loan. This makes sense in practice, but it takes far too long to climb the ladder in the current system.\\n\\nIf your credit score is in the low 600s or even lower, and you land a solid job, start making a decent living, and are making 100% on time payments, it will take you literally years to get afloat to the scores that are basic requirements of a loan for a home or car. With a shaky history that was course corrected, your score might even plateau before the minimum requirements for loans, making it nearly impossible to move up the economic ladder. Make one mistake though, and you aren't worthy of lending to any more, and you have to fight uphill to get back your reputation. With people living paycheck to paycheck, this is basically a revolving trap.\\n\\nMore so, simple things like paying off loans early, or consolidating debt into one place (reducing lines of credits) start to have detrimental effects to your score, which is completely contrary to risk analysis of credit worthiness.\\n\\nIf you can pay back a loan early, this means you are a better borrower. Full stop. A personal loan to a friend who needs help works this way, why should loans from banks be treated any differently. Oh wait, I think I know why...\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\nAs a personal anecdote, I recently decided to pay off my car loan to make budgetary room for monthly savings on a down payment for a house. My credit score dropped from 827, to 734.  It took me 3 years to go from 750 to breaking 800. 100% on time payments for 10 years, always pay in full every month, 4 credit cards, no student loans (previously paid off in full). If the system was built to reward good borrowers, my score would not have changed by such a significant amount.\\n\\nInstead, it's completely obvious what the motives are and I refuse to play the game. I have virtually zero debt beyond the 1-5% monthly credit card usage for groceries and stuff. I'm done with credit going forwards.\", \"I review credit reports as a part of my job, I work in mortgage lending. I don't know how many I have reviewed but I would say its around 15,000 at this point in my career. I am no expert but have a pretty good idea what it take to have a good credit score (700+) and it does not require massive amounts of debt. How credit scores work should really be taught in high school. Home economics class being phased out of high school is a tragedy. \\n\\nI have seen plenty of people in their mid 20s who have only ever had 1-2 credit cards and a car loan with 800 scores. I have also seen people in their 30s and 40s who have no credit and never have had credit. \\n\\nThey can be a little arbitrary and prone to errors. The errors though are typically the fault of reporting agencies not Experian, Transunion or Equifax. The issue with the credit bureaus is more that they are difficult to deal with and painfully slow. But its not a scam. How much debt you have does not really effect the credit agencies bottom line. \\n\\nPeople get frustrated often by credit scores because of the wide range that you see. Whatever score your bank or credit cards gives you on an app is different score than what the car dealer will see, the landlord will see or the mortgage lender will see.\", \"FWIW, UK renters can use their rent payments to improve their credit ratings - https://www.creditladder.co.uk/ (Not affiliated)\\n\\nWhen I got my mortgage it was not really based on my CR but rather the 'affordability test'. Amazingly, I was able to borrow the £18K I needed, even on a 4-figure income, as I had the other £18K saved, and the mortgage payments were going to be like £80pcm or so.\", 'This video fails to mention the most basic information that you will find online about credit scores, and that is its composition. Once you start understanding the composition of your credit score, a lot of what is said in this video crumbles. So lets take a look:\\n\\nhttps://www.myfico.com/credit-education/whats-in-your-credit-score\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/b2l2T0e\\n\\nThis is a picture of roughly what goes into your score, go ahead and look up \"credit score composition\" to see images like it.\\n\\nThe biggest element to your credit score is your **Payment History**, there are varying degrees of missing a payment, but it will stay on your score from months to years if you forget to make a payment or have an account make it to collections. Only thing you have to do here is set up an auto pay to do at least the minimum every month, this way you will never miss a payment. I\\'d recommend paying more than the minimum but that\\'s just so you don\\'t get killed by interest. You can read more about how many days is delinquent and more specifics at the resources I put at the bottom.\\n\\nThe next biggest item is your **Credit Utilization**, which is a simple ratio of how much you have on balance vs how much you are allowed to borrow. Owe $5,000 and have a limit of $10,000? Your utilization would be 50%. However, this is a finicky one, because unlike other elements to your score, it doesn\\'t have a \"memory\". What that means is that, say one month you are totally balls to the wall on all your cards, 99% utilization on all of them, totally maxed out. If you were to do a credit check that month, it will tank your score, because your utilization is super high, however, if next month, you come into some money and pay it all off, so you are now at 0%, do another credit check and it will boost it way up. It doesn\\'t take into consideration your history of credit usage, it\\'s just in the moment.\\n\\nThe general rule of thumb is to keep it below 30%, but 0% is best, there is no need to carry a balance on any card.\\n\\nThe smaller categories are as follows, **New Credit**, **Length of History**, and **Credit Mix**. The rules for these are simple:\\n\\n* Don\\'t apply/open up a bunch of credit cards or loans in tight succession. Every time you apply for a card or loan, you get whats called a \"hard check\" on your score, this will ding it by a few points, get a bunch of those in a short time span and it will ding it by more. But if you do get dinged, its fine, it will go away in a few months.\\n* Don\\'t close your oldest account. If you close your oldest account it will shorten the average age of your credit. This is a passive category, best thing you can do is open an account at 18 and never close that first account, just have like a $5 subscription on it and have it on auto pay so it never misses a payment, check in on it every month and you\\'ll be fine.\\n* And finally, try to have some variation. Credit lenders like to see that you are not only capable of handling credit card debt but also other various instruments of lending, you\\'ll collect these as you go through life, things like car loans, mortgages, etc. But its a tiny category and won\\'t make that big a difference overall.\\n\\nAn important thing to acknowledge, we don\\'t know the actual formula behind the score, but FICO is nice enough to provide us with rough boundaries. And based on countless individual experiences, we have managed to over time compile a pretty definitive guideline on how to get a good score. A good start to this guideline is in the resources I put at the bottom.\\n\\nSo by looking at these components of your score, you\\'ll see that several things that the dude says in the video can\\'t possibly be true. Things like\\n\\n> Your credit score rewards you NOT for making decisions that actually help you financially, but for taking on the maximum amount of debt that you can possibly repay.\\n\\nIt will not, in fact, reward you for taking on all of your debt, that would increase your utilization ratio, and would tank your score. \\n\\nThis video paints a very bleak and cynical picture of credit and lending, and while parts of it aren\\'t entirely off the mark, especially bits about the 70\\'s and 80\\'s. Overall, and especially in its closing notes, it goes to great lengths to paint a dramatic and dystopian picture of credit, which is not entirely deserved.\\n\\nIt\\'s an easy thing to criticize, and a dangerous one to defend, because many people have been scorned by their score in one way or another for no other reason than they didn\\'t know how it actually worked. So they made one or two stupid mistakes that then fucked them over for some time. \\n\\nIf I could extract one useful nugget of information from this video it would be that, yes, your credit score is not the end all be all number of your financial life. It\\'s an aspect of it, one way of measuring something very specific which is how trustworthy of a person you are to lend to. Don\\'t stress too much about it, after all it only matters when you are actually going to take out a loan for something (like a house or car), so if you have to max out your cards for a bit because you\\'re in a tight spot, that\\'s fine, just remember to pay it all off and make it look as pretty as possible a few months before the big purchase.\\n\\n\\nThere is a massive lack of education in personal finance matters in today\\'s society (well its actually always been this way, just now its more complex), evidence for this statement can be easily found in this thread. \\n\\n**HOWEVER**\\n\\n \\nIt doesn\\'t have to be this way, there are many tools out there now that provide lots of resources to people wanting to learn about credit. First on this list, there is an absolutely fantastic community that I couldn\\'t recommend enough called /r/personalfinance that will get you more than up and running on every aspect of your, well, personal finance. You should read their top 500 posts and their entire wiki, its that much of a treasure trove of information. More specifically /r/CreditCards has a lot of information about credit cards and is worth looking at their top 100 as well. [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com) is another fantastic resource that will help you get a free daily estimate on your credit score along with other helpful tools. There is plenty more out there that I haven\\'t mentioned because I have to cut myself off at some point. Please do yourself a favor, however, and treat yourself to an education in personal finance, it really will help you achieve your goals in life and will eliminate much stress out of your life.']}]"
