Begin the process of placing accounts with us for recovery through our Claims Request Form “We have been using the collection services of National Judgment Investment Corp. for the last decade. While our in-house team is adept at collections, there comes a time where files need to be turned over to third-party professionals. Currently, NJIC is the only debt collection service we are using because of its expertise in quickly and professionally recovering our accounts receivable. We have been extremely satisfied with both NJIC’s success rate and service. More importantly, NJIC’s collection rate of dollars placed versus dollars recovered is in excess of 80%. This bottom line pleases both our Board of Directors and shareholders.” Steven H., Credit Services Manager Medical Device Manufacturer, NYSE listed based in Minnesota. “Ever since the first account I placed with NJIC, I have found their collection processes, professional team and accountability second to none. There have been several accounts which I had personally considered to be uncollectible and reserved for, yet NJIC was able to recover those delinquent accounts! Over the years I have placed many high five-figure accounts with NJIC for collection not just because of their successful rate of recovery, but because I trust them – I believe that is the most valuable quality when placing a company’s cash flow and name on the line with a third-party collector.” Emily L., President Publishing Company, NJ “We are very satisfied with National Judgment’s debt recovery services especially during the past year of COVID. The ability to collect unpaid invoices from businesses damaged by the pandemic requires a skillful touch in getting our company’s invoices elevated to the top of the line to be paid while other creditors are knocking on the door for payment. We believe that NJIC’s attorney driven approach gets us to the front of the payment line quickly when fighting for limited dollars available to pay ever increasing creditors. I highly recommend NJIC’s services for any company experiencing non-paying customers.” John C., Chief Financial Officer Software Company, NASDAQ listed San Francisco, CA “Since January 2015 we have discontinued using all other debt recovery agencies that we previously dealt with and are exclusively using National Judgment Investment Corporation exclusively. We have been nothing less than amazed at their ability to pursue and successfully recover our accounts receivable, many of which date back over two to three years. In fact, many of the accounts recovered by National Judgment Investment Corporation were accounts that had been previously placed with another agency who had been unsuccessful in recovering any monies due our company.” Manufacturer, Fortune 500 Company Evansville, IN “The collection firm of NJIC has performed exceptionally with the accounts we have placed with it for recovery.  At least one of NJIC’s recoveries was from a company which was out of business! NJIC’s in-house legal team crafted an argument which paved the way for NJIC to make the recovery from the acquirer of the debtor company. While we have used collection firms in the past, NJIC was the first and only firm we have used which combines legal power with collection talent on a contingency fee basis. Their collection rate with our files is in excess of 80%. We highly recommend NJIC for B2B collections.” Jasper M., Collection & Credit Manager Technology Company, Boca Raton, FL Previous Next Contact NJIC National Judgment Investment Corp.
