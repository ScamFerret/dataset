Unfortunately, we've received many complaints regarding Project Keyboard, specifically it's owner, onefiftynine's distinct lack of communication in previous weeks. Customers of Project Keyboards have received no updates to order status of their items, nor have they received purchased goods from Project Keyboard. We have reached out to moderators on the Project Keyboard Discord to attempt to get in contact with onefiftynine, but unfortunately they did not receive a response either. The last announcement post on the discord was from 6/17/2022 announcing the extras sale for GMK Dolch R5, GMK Masterpiece, and GMK Noire. The last time onefiftynine made a post in his own server was 5/5/2022. Unfortunately onefiftynine's discord account seems to be inactive. We can come to that conclusion as his account is still using the old number identifier system that was phased out earlier this year. \\n\\nWe are cautioning users to avoid Project Keyboard at this time. For those with open orders, please be aware of your consumer rights, including a right to charge back. While at this time, we do not have the amount of data available we had for Mechs&Co, you can certainly use the [tools posted on the latest PSA regarding how to file a chargeback.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/15bl163/psa_mechs_co_transparency_update_next_steps/) As with any PSA, the intention is not for this to be a witch hunt.

These disputes even include products that we were told were never ordered, as well as cancelled project such as Saevus's Cor65XT keyboard. Although Mechs & Co. have agreed to have CannonKeys fulfill GMK Terror Below, our request regarding these chargebacks was blatantly ignored. If your chargeback is disputed by Mechs & Co, your best solution is to attempt to escalate as high up the chain of command that you can.
