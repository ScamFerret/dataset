It mentions that personal information is collected with the user's knowledge and for identified purposes, and it also describes the security measures taken to protect personal information. The Privacy Policy seems to be clear and not ambiguous, reflecting a commitment to protecting user privacy. There is no mention of payment methods in the extracted text, and so far, I have not found evidence of unusual payment methods being used.
