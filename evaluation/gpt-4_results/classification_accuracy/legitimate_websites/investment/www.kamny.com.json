As an asset allocator if you are taking meetings with people that aren't smarter than you, you're probably doing it wrong.  I've seen incoming analysts have a hard time with this rationalization.

I'm starting to get to that point now where the feedback loop does not introduce any new challenges. Ofc any job can be like this but it can be particularly true here, I've sat in on industry webinars/conference breakouts where the primary topic of discussion was how to develop new carrots to continue challenging employees. Being a self starter is very important and there's eventually an aspect where you are only doing work for yourself that might not be lauded or even seen by your peers (e.g. creating a new model/analysis on one of your coverage managers to help you better understand their strategy/performance).\\n\\n\\\\- There's not a lot of room at the top.
