What was attributed to his amazing success was a gift to be able to see the chess board many moves ahead of others.\\n\\n**This recommendation is my attempt at seeing the chess board ahead of others.**\\n\\nAfter the ink dries on the Definitive Agreement & [CCIV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CCIV&src=cashtag_click) snags [@LucidMotors](https://twitter.com/LucidMotors), people are going to view Michael Klein as an all-star SPAC sponsor with which they want their money aligned with, and they\\'re going to start searching out his \"next\" SPAC hits.  I predict they\\'re absolutely going to pile into [$CVII.U](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CVII.U&src=cashtag_click) with it being by far his next largest SPAC in size (far larger than either CCV or CCVI).   I believe that investor behaviour to be entirely logical.  I see no reason why Klein should not be considered a SPAC all-star like Hoffman, Chamath, Gerstner, Sagansky, etc... all of whom have their pre-target SPACs trade 20% to 60% above NAV while target hunting.\\n\\n**CVII is currently trading at $10.78, but I am convinced CVII will be driven to $12 - $15 pre-target like other SPAC All-stars, and that this will be easy $$$.**  Whether you choose to hold until \"target\" or not is your choice, that\\'s not what this recommendation is about, **my prediction here is that this is an easy >= 20% gain in relatively short order.**  Keep in mind most casual investors dont even know CVII even EXISTS yet! It just started trading on Friday, and some brokerages didnt even have the ticker available for purchase. I observed numerous large purchases  last week on IPO day (link below), and those were surely hedge funds. It\\'s so early that these are Units for sale, not commons.  My belief is that in approximately 7 weeks when the warrants split off from commons, the warrants will likely be at least $2 each, for a 40¢ proportionality to commons.  With that in mind, with CVII trading at $10.78 as I type this, the \"free warrants\" should bring your purchase on the commons down to about $10.38, or less than a 4% markup to NAV.\\n\\nYou could do a lot worse.\\n\\nF*ULL DISCLOSURE: I am long about 3,000 units of CVII.U at roughly $10.72.* I would buy more, but a poopton of my portfolio is currently tied-up in CCIV.\\n\\nLink to large prints on Day #1 of IPO:\\nhttps://twitter.com/mcspacface/status/1360292859342180352\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nPrevious Reddit DD #1 =\\nRECOMMENDATION: Buy Churchill Capital Corp IV\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/jfjz65/recommendation\\\\_buy\\\\_churchill\\\\_capital\\\\_corp\\\\_iv/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/jfjz65/recommendation_buy_churchill_capital_corp_iv/)', 'comments': [\"Hi!

There are many ways in which a sponsor may be a “bad SPAC actor”, but in Klein’s case he seems perfectly willing to screw over his shareholders in completion of deals which greatly enrich Michael Klein.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n**CCX** – Klein takes your money & buys two near bankrupt entities & fuses them together. This is precisely the sort of seemingly reckless, high-risk deal which originally gave SPACs their bad name & shady reputation of olden days.\\n\\n**CCXX** – Klein takes your money & buys MultiPlan, not the most inspiring target, but it is not the target which bothers me, it’s what I believe is the largest shareholder dilution in the history of SPACs which went along with it. Kline got the deal done & screwed his shareholders to do so. Bigly.\\n\\n**CCV** – Klein creates the 1st ever SPAC with $9 floor. One can only presume this targets dopey Robinhood & Webull “investors” & the recent uneducated retail hoards pouring money into SPACs. Klein could use your cash to buy, “*Sally’s Salmonella Salad Shack*”, and at a bare minimum he’ll take 10% of your money off-the-top to do so.\\n\\n**Knowing all of this, why in God’s name would I recommend you buy CCIV?**\\n\\n1. Klein is greatly incentivized to pull a rabbit out of his hat this time. His name has taken a beating on CCX & CCXX. If he wants to continue raking in “easy” (and it is easy) money via the SPAC game, he needs a solid result, and he needs it NOW.\\n2. CCIV is the second largest SPAC in history (2nd to only PSTH) at >$2B, meaning it has a baked-in competitive advantage in target-hunting over that of 99% of other SPACs currently on the market.  This is extremely important given how \"crowded\" the SPAC playing field has become, and my sense is very few people understand this. Klein can target companies nobody else can. Literally.\\n3. CCIV trades under NAV @ $9.91 w/fractional warrant & $9.66 without (warrant currently $1.25).  Klein\\'s recent performance is so poor, he\\'s joined the sub-NAV crowd.  As such, investing now is literally guaranteed money.\\n4. Klein is the most Kingdom of Saudi Arabia connected investor on Wall Street. Lucid Motors will likely go public within 2 years. S.A. owns >50% of Lucid. This has triggered speculation CCIV will snag Lucid. Do I think that? No. But it doesn’t matter what I think, if you even get so much as rumor the 2 parties briefly spoke, CCIV will likely spike hard even if the rumor is 100% false.\\n\\n**The math:**\\n\\nFor ease of math purposes, I’m going to ignore warrants & deal with CCIV common shares (though CCIV.U warrants are intriguing) & a presumption Klein finds a deal exactly 12 months from now (e.g. 15 months since inception). Purchase today at $9.66 represents an automatic 3.52% worst-case gain. Not too shabby in a world with no interest rate. A deal announced sooner than 12 months is upside to that 3.52% A.P.R. Now let’s say a rumor takes this thing to $10.30 or $10.60, which, given the size of this SPAC & the fact it’s Michael Klein, is not unreasonable. Now you’re looking at 6.6% to 9.7% returns on sale via rumor.  If the rumor does involve Lucid, something like a >$12 run is not unreasonable as Lucid is the one EV company Elon Musk fears. Ignoring rumors there is the chance I\\'m speculating that Kline does in fact snag a very solid target.  If so, the sky\\'s the limit on this sub-NAV SPAC.\\n\\nYes, Klein\\'s stunk lately, but at the end of the day Michael Klein is still Michael Kline. He is one of the true B.S.D.s of Wall Street.  I think this is a no-brainer buy & hold. This is how you SPAC.\\n\\n*FULL DISCLOSURE: I am long 5,000 units of CCIV.U at sub-NAV (i.e. below $10 floor) with its\\' corresponding 1,000 warrants, which I have not sold.*\\n\\n*EDIT to DISCLOSURE: I added 1,000 more units of CCIV.U at sub-NAV.  Position is now 6,000 units with its\\' corresponding 1,200 warrants.*\\n\\n*EDIT #2 to DISCLOSURE: I quickly doubled my position as soon as the Lucid rumor broke at about $11.70, then I continued to add more as the day wore on. Position is now something a bit less than 14,000 shares @ something like $10.80.
