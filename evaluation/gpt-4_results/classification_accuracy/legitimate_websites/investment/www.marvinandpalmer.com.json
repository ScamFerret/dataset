I think the biggest issue with both characters, especially Locke considering he's pretty much the main character of 5, is that they are very one-dimensional when we already have our token character for that. Locke doesn't go through any growth or changes throughout the entirety of his story and nor does Palmer. Palmer is clearly a stand-in for Johnson's gruff military type, but she's just cornier and unnecessary about it. Before you go and say that Chief was a one-dimensional character, he is for the most part (he has his moments otherwise), but through this the writers would develop the other characters around him. No one in Locke's case does this and thus it all remains incredibly static and boring. Locke could have been good, but the writers kinda let that down.\", \"Palmer is mostly hated from her Spartan Ops / Escalation behavior, not from H4's base campaign. There's a line between friendly ball-busting banter and straight up compromising missions / coming off as a hateful dick because of how aggressive she acts. The tall joke was never really an issue in the wider Halo community at the time.\\n\\nLocke is hated from the misleading H5 marketing + he's just super bland in the campaign. Nothing really interesting about him and the marketing hyped him up otherwise.\", \"Palmer was alright for me up until Spartan Ops in Halo 4.\\n\\nI don't know if Spartan IV fireteams have a HR equivalent, but I'd report her ass immediately. \\n\\nDoesn't provide good intel, aggravates her co-workers, vanishes midway through the mission, delegates responsabilities to unqualified personnel, fosters unfriendly rivalries between her employees, talks shit about workers from other departments behind their backs.\\n\\nJust unprofessional all around.\", 'Palmer sucked in Spartan Ops and the Halo Escalation comic.\\n\\nThe tall joke was just her kidding with the Chief acknowledging how he *is* super tall. She makes the joke like “heh, you’re not that tall”, with them both knowing he already exceeds heights that exceed normal height.', \"I didn't think they were interesting tbh, they have good actors but they are never utilized to do anything memorable with them. Palmer gets like 10 seconds of memorable lines in the spartan ops intro but that's about it. Locke is just sort of 'there' I guess and that is probably just a product of Halo 5's mess of a story.\"]}]"
