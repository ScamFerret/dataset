I didn\\'t even get out of the parking lot because the chain was slipping and gears kept jumping. I *rode* this bike to Full Cycle, no gears jumped, the chain wasn\\'t slipping, the brakes rock hard (hydraulic disc brakes and I like the front brakes to be tight/hard enough to flip the bike at the touch of a finger, that means no air in the lines whatsoever) so for the bike to feel worse than when I brought it in *and* having to pay $300, I wasn\\'t impressed.\\n\\nI politely say the gearing is off, and the head mechanic starts trying to sell me a new cassette, new crankset. I tell him he didn\\'t tune it right or even do a QA ride after the tuneup.\\n\\nthis goes on *all day*. After the *fourth time* I go in, I make it half way up the hill on Montreal Rd and BAM, the pedals seize, the bike literally locked up. Fortunately I was on the sidewalk when this happened and not in the road flirting with traffic. I turned around and head back.\\n\\nThis time, he takes my bike before I even get a chance to take my phone off it and he rides it around the building where I couldn\\'t see him, he comes back 5 or so minutes later and starts talking about things that **I had only mentioned in intimate, private conversations on my phone**. **He had gone through my phone, and looked in a conversation with someone I an intimately involved with, with photos he is not allowed to see.**\\n\\nI know a few things about bikes. I told him he needs to redo the cables. He insisted he is a professional, but he puts the bike on that stand thing and says \"I can\\'t adjust this screw anymore,\" well, if you hadn\\'t skipped steps and reset those adjustment screws when you changed the cables, you wouldn\\'t be having any of these problems. He also went into this spiel about how you can\\'t use the two big gears on a bike instead of just admitting he used a 9 speed chain on a 10 speed bike. The brakes feel spongy as if air was let into the system, purposefully. \\n\\nThe level of incompetence, the unprofessionalism, the sheer *ego* of the head mechanic at Full Cycle at St. Laurent is appalling.', 'comments': []}]"
