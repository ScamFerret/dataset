It was a letter saying that due to a sale I made on Amazon in August of 2014, I had an unclaimed balance of $55.57 that was due to me. It talked about how  I needed to verify my address, claim the funds, then sign and print my name. It said that if I didn\\'t claim the funds, then the funds would be sent to the state agency of my last known state of residence, in this case South Carolina.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt was a very legitimate looking letter, as I\\'m sure all good scams tend to be, but I thought this was suspicious already for two reasons: 1) free money is always suspicious unless it\\'s a 401k match from your employer (thanks pf) 2) I recently saw a post on here or maybe r/all were someone talked about looking up through your state agency to see if you had unclaimed property funds. While the process itself IS legit, I used that system and didn\\'t find any unclaimed property for myself or any of my immediate family. This was maybe a month ago when I made that search, so I thought it was weird that I would all of a sudden get this letter.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t impossible for me to have unclaimed money from 2014 either; I made an Amazon Payments account to resell textbooks I had purchased while I was in college, but knowing college me, I would have made dang sure I got $55 pretty immediately because I was broke.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLong story short, I called Amazon customer service who then contacted Amazon Payments. They assured me that they DO NOT conduct business in this way, that the funds would have been credited to my account or I would have gotten an email about it. I got a follow up email from my customer service representative asking me to forward a picture of the letter on to their fraud/phishing department.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI just wanted to let everyone know that this is in fact a scam. I saw one other post after extensive googling about this and it was from two months ago, so this might be a recent thing, but this is NOT from Amazon. They only ask for your printed name and signature but I\\'m sure someone could do plenty of things with both of those.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTldr; Amazon Payments customer service confirmed that unpaid/unclaimed property letter was a scam.\\n\\nEdit: seems like there\\'s a lot of conflicting information here but I\\'m just going to wait until the end of the year and check my state agency\\'s website. Amazon themselves sent me two separate emails saying this was a scam, picture links are in the comments. My bf pointed out sketchy things about the letter too, like the fact that the letter was printed in greyscale and didn\\'t look like something Amazon would have an official stamp on. Also, there\\'s a letter \"Z\" badly hidden/printed behind bubble number 3. I\\'m just going to play it safe on this one, if I hear of any updates I\\'ll edit here but in my opinion I\\'m saying this is a scam with the information I have, and I\\'m going to play it safe.

My company sends legitimate letters like this all of the time. People call back asking what the original check was for. There is no way for me to determine that. I tell them send the letter back and get your check or collect it after it's been sent to unclaimed property. I wish my company had a process for us to be able to research, but I don't think they find it worth the time and money it would cost for someone to research it.\", 'Did he by any chance say that you need to contact someone in Florida?
