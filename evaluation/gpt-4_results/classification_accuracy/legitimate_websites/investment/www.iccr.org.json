The Climate Crisis Given the existential threat climate change and pollution pose to the planet, investors expect companies to mitigate their environmental risks. As key corporate stakeholders, investors expect companies to implement policies and practices that support worker welfare. ICCR members advocate for corporate reforms that increase the equitable access and affordability of health care both in the U.S. and abroad. ICCR members press for responsible corporate political activities that align with company values and advance democracy. Global supply chains are in need of a transformation, one that benefits all stakeholders. ICCR Membership Membership in ICCR is open to any institutional investor interested in promoting corporate social responsibility.
