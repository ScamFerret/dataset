Trigger was pulled by CRA; this sales level automatically required the corporation to file GST quarterly (rather than annually). CRA sent notice of this requirement mid-year. Next, 4 days later, CRA issued high notional (estimated) assessments for GST for the first two quarters. Just like that. here Canada Wide Service We work with clients all over Canada Let’s talk!

Then what you're left with is the carbon tax impact (it's more sophisticated than this but this is the gist)\\n\\nThe difference between marginal and average carbon taxes - Marginal is 65 $/t while Average is what an industry would pay after exemptions. Some of the numbers are a bit old (2020) but when the marginal rate was 30 $/t a lot of industries were only paying 5-10 $/t. Farming is around 90% exempt from carbon taxes.\\n\\nSo to show this I take the lifecycle carbon emissions of several foods and see how much they would increase in price with a full carbon tax. This number at most would be 8.2% since 2019. But when you add in exemptions that number falls drastically to 1.6% when only removing 90% of farm emissions. Then to 0.3% like Tombe when you apply average tax rates to the other emissions.\\n\\nI did this to show empirically how the carbon tax affects your grocery bill and my estimates were close to Tombe's. Overall this would mean per capita the carbon tax would incur \\\\~65$/year at the high end or 12 $/year at the low end of my calcs. Which is more than covered by the Carbon Rebates.\\n\\nIn regards to the carbon rebates you can login to your CRA account and see how much you will be getting on January 15th. Since I'm in Alberta I will be receiving 193$, if you're in Rural Canada you will get a premium. This will happen 4 times this year.\\n\\nI plan on making more videos that cover topics like rural Canada, Pollieve's Technology not Taxes plan (hint it's more expensive than the carbon tax), and many other related topics.\\n\\nI'm more than happy to have further discussions with people on this subject in my discord or in the comments below.\", 'comments': [\"It's amazing how much fire and fury has been devoted to such a small issue.

To kick the teeth of Canadians in further the government of Canada has decided to give every single Ukrainian adult coming to Canada $3000 and $1500 for each child of our tax money tax free. Assuming two thirds of that 210,178 people are parents with one child that’s $421,357,000 for Ukrainian parents and $105,089,000 for Ukrainian children. The article goes on to say 90k more we’re planning on coming before the March 2024 cutoff. Canadians have given Ukranians $526,446,000 of our money tax free. So more than half a billion.\\n\\nSources: https://www.immigration.ca/thousands-of-ukrainians-to-come-to-canada-in-the-first-few-months-of-2024/amp/\\n\\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/ukraine-measures/settlement/get-financial-assistance.html\\n\\nThen we have $190M in aid we’ve given to Gaza. Do we control the Gaza Strip? No. Do we have illegal Canadian settlements there? No. Did we pound Gaza with 2000 LB bombs on Palestinians in Gaza? No. Have we forcefully removed Palestinans from their homes? No. Why are we paying for the actions of another country that doesn’t solve our own issues. Does Israel pay Canada to help with the housing crisis? What about our healthcare system does Israel provide tax free interest free loans for Canadian hospital infrastructure? No. Why are we helping them. To add salt to injury we’re one of the countries agreeing to take civilians from Gaza  who no longer have homes because of Israel during a housing crisis. Israel should bear full responsibility along with the Middle East for that. We should cut all funding.\\n\\nNext the government in true tone deaf fashion is saying they want to increase aid every year they’re in office. This year they want to spend $7B of our tax money earned from our work on foreigners. This is the same government that gave $10M of our money to develop youth in Iraq while here we have youth unemployment rates that mimic what we had during the great financial crisis (12.6%).\\n\\nhttps://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/liberals-buck-global-trend-in-doubling-down-on-foreign-aid-as-sector-urges-g7-push-1.6852097\\n\\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7065213\\n\\nWe should completely cut all foreign aid worldwide to the bear minimum, while putting all of the money the government takes from us towards things that will benefit us (housing and healthcare). Immigration should also go back to being only for skilled folks again with mass deportations of all illegals and foreign boomers who are not currently Canadians. In 2019 alone illegals costed us $400M that number is probably much higher now. It’s assumed the $340M we pay for these folks from healthcare to their accommodations will become an annual thing if things don’t change. It’s assumed there’s 20k-500k illegals in Canada. They should all be deported. We’d save half a billion in doing so. \\n\\nSources: https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/canada/irregular-migrants-on-track-to-cost-canada-almost-400-million-watchdog-says-1.4197552\\n\\nhttps://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/feds-pledge-362-million-to-provinces-cities-to-temporarily-house-asylum-seekers-1.6750321\\n\\nhttps://torontosun.com/news/national/free-hotel-rooms-meals-for-refugee-applicants-reportedly-cost-769m-in-2023\\n\\nEvery dollar of taxpayer money should only go to improving the lives of Canadians first and foremost. We have a housing crisis it should go there or towards infrastructure or towards our military and our safety. Not $1 should go towards foreigners while Canadians are becoming homelessness on masse.

They are people with money - those are the type of people who could actually afford to leave. Many of them were not even living in Ukraine for years - they had been working in Europe, as many have taken to doing, sending money back home. When the war started, these Ukrainian gastarbeiters (guest worker in German) from Europe jumped on the opportunity to come to Canada. Worst of all, many are actually leaving or looking to leave because they say the Canadian government doesn’t give enough money. The EU gives more free shit, the currency has purchasing power, and everything is cheaper than Canada.
