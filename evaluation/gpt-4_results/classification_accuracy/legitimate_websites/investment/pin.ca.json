This is extremely common sense, but here's how to spot these fake websites:\\n\\n\\\\- they're selling prohibited firearms or ammunition.\\n\\n\\\\- they're selling products for WAY less than anyone else. If it's too good to be true, it is.\\n\\n\\\\- they claim to have powder/primers in stock for way less than anyone else.\\n\\n\\\\- they have some bullshit name like the ones above.\\n\\n\\\\- they have unfinished Lorem Ipsum type content, spelling mistakes, or nonsense wording.\\n\\n\\\\- they only take payment via Paypal, EMT, or some American processor like Zelle. If they DO NOT accept a credit card, 99% of the time, it's a scam. The 1% are old boys and you'll be able to search them or get word of mouth reviews. Their website will look like Geocities from 1997.\\n\\n\\\\- they reuse the same images/branding/stock images from multiple sites, or just straight up rip off logos from old sites (Canadaammo being the main one, which is now defunct).\\n\\n\\\\- the mailing address/physical address/phone number will be at a random location, usually a warehouse or house that is in no way associated with a firearms business. A quick google search will pull it up.\\n\\n**------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\\n\\n**If you have purchased from one of these sites, you should immediately:**\\n\\n\\\\- put a credit hold on with your bank, depending on what financial information you gave them. If you typed in a credit card, it will be compromised and should be cancelled.\\n\\n\\\\- If you gave them your PAL, you should contact the CFP and report it as compromised and get a new one issued.\\n\\n**------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\\n\\n**Now, what can we do to stop these?**\\n\\nUnfortunately, not much. We have two options:\\n\\n1. Anything with a .ca domain can be reported to the CIRA using  [info@cira.ca](mailto:info@cira.ca). They have full authority to revoke a .ca domain and there are stricter registration requirements for those sites. The more reports they get, the more likely they are to take action.\\n2. You can report scam websites to search engines. For example, here is Google's report page: [https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report\\\\_phish/?hl=en](https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/?hl=en)\\n\\n**------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\\n\\nWe will keep updating the list as it grows, but PLEASE use common sense. These sites are very obvious.\", 'comments': ['Check their \"about us\" page and read up on their \"company values\". It\\'s usually some GPT-written shit about the 2A or blurbs about some random gun company. Look up their physical address too.

Like ugh dude you couldâ€™ve just asked me and I couldâ€™ve told you in 2 seconds it was a scam. \\n\\nTo add to the list:\\n-if they have something in stock nobody else has in stock, probably a scam\\n-if you can add an unlimited amount of product to your cart and go to checkout with a trillion dollar order, itâ€™s a scam.\\n\\nAlso, donâ€™t friggen use etransfer, ever, unless itâ€™s buying from an individual on CGN or GP. Even if the store is legit and they screw up somehow and are difficult, you have no recourse. At least with credit cards you can do or even just threaten a chargeback and have purchase protection if it is a scam.']}]"
