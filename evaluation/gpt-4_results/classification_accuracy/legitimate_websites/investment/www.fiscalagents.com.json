It retains Saints Row\\'s sense of humor and mayhem all while adding in team-oriented gameplay. It\\'s the agents and their individual stories that steal the show thanks to snappy writing, bizarre scenarios, and perfect comedic timing. The story itself is a highlight thanks to the insane villains, although it takes a few chapters before things pick up. It\\'s disappointing that the remaining activities are so repetitive and lack the imagination of what Volition is known for, and with a myriad of technical issues, it feels like Agents of Mayhem was shoved out the door earlier than it should have. Still, despite a few hiccups, there are still hours of fun to be had with Agents of Mayhem. It may not be the best open-world game out there, but like its predecessors, it stands out in a sea of AAA titles that take themselves far too seriously.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**Hobby Consolas** - José L.

The best thing of the game: the possibilities of the Agents.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**IGN** - Jon Ryan - [7.1 / 10.0](http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review)\\n\\n>Agents of Mayhem does a good job paying homage to the cartoon and live-action TV heroes of the 80s and 90s, and revels in the absurd tropes and idiosyncrasies of those inspirations. A broad and goofy arsenal of unique weapons and gadgets and the ability to switch characters on the fly to access complementary abilities offers some solid combat and good mindless fun, but due to some unpolished writing and repetitive environments and enemy types, it doesn\\'t fully live up to its heroic potential.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**IGN Italy** - Felice Di Giuseppe - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10.0](http://it.ign.com/agents-of-mayhem-ps4/129522/review/agents-of-mayhem-la-recensione)\\n\\n>A refined, fun and surprising spin-off that you don\\'t have to miss.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**IGN Spain** - David Soriano - *Spanish* - [7 / 10.0](http://es.ign.com/agents-of-mayhem-ps4/122107/review/agents-of-mayhem-analisis-para-ps4-xbox-one-y-pc)\\n\\n>Agents of Mayhem does not do anything wrong, but it also does not stand out in any of its mechanics.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**Kotaku** - Mike Fahey - [No Verdict](http://kotaku.com/agents-of-mayhem-the-kotaku-review-1797840217)\\n\\n>Agents of Mayhem is many things, but mostly it\\'s what happens when the development studio responsible for one of the raunchiest game series dials back the dildos and gives its heroes a little more maturity and humanity.\\n>\\n>It\\'s something special. Like Uranus.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**Metro GameCentral** - GameCentral - [5 / 10](http://metro.co.uk/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review-spinning-out-of-control-6853021/)\\n\\n>An obnoxious and repetitive open world game that does its best to hide the fact that it\\'s a surprisingly decent third person shooter.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**PlayStation LifeStyle** - Chandler Wood - [6.5 / 10.0](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review-find-seoul-ps4/)\\n\\n>There\\'s a lot to love in Agents of Mayhem, which makes the pitfalls harder to swallow. An imaginative story and cast of characters is burdened by an uninspired and soulless open-world. Exciting character combat gets pushed out of the limelight by notable slowdown and other bugs that inhibit gameplay. In a day where open-world games are evolving and giving players a lot more depth, meaning, and life, Agents of Mayhem feels like a step backwards. Volition ought to consider either abandoning or stepping up the open-world if they decide to continue the franchise.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**Polygon** - Justin McElroy - [5.5 / 10.0](https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/15/16147318/agents-of-mayhem-review-pc-windows-ps4-xbox-one-playstation-4-volition-saints-row)\\n\\n>You can swap between the three agents you bring into the field instantly, letting you chain their different special attacks together for maximum impact. There are some clever choices here too. Derby star Daisy, for example, has to cool off her minigun by dashing through enemies, which turns a typically boring weapon cooldown mechanic into a renewable power resource.Remember those great characters? Well, practically all their dialogue is bland beyond belief. Much of the writing in Agents of Mayhem is “joke adjacent,” meaning it\\'s delivered with the tone, pacing and structure of a joke, but is not, in actuality, funny in any way.This has likely started to feel like a litany of sins rather than cogent critique, but it\\'s the best way I have of illustrating Agent of Mayhem\\'s failings. It is not felled by any one thing, but is rather undone by a thousand little cuts. Agents of Mayhem heaps theoretical fun on you. Characters, powers, upgrades, tons of missions — it\\'s desperate to for the player to just have fun. It\\'s a noble impulse, but one that it\\'s depressingly incapable of consistently delivering on.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**Press Start** - Damian Filippone - [8 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2017/08/15/agents-mayhem-review-run-gun-fun/)\\n\\n>If subtlety was a person, I\\'m pretty sure the Agents of Mayhem would tell them to \"suck it\". It flies its flag of in-your-face attitude with pride and does it so well, that you can almost forgive it for making really lame jokes about things like Uranus. If you\\'re looking for some unadulterated adult fun, then I recommend becoming an Agent of Mayhem today.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**PS Site** - Paweł Musiolik - *Polish* - [8 / 10.0](http://www.pssite.com/recenzje/2603/recenzja-agents-of-mayhem-ps4.html)\\n\\n>Agents of Mayhem is succesfully trying to buy the Saints Row series more vacation time. Volition has shown once again that they\\'re best at making \"cool\" games where impossible does not exist. This time, they also tried to make a better quality genre mix, which introduces some freshness.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**Push Square** - Alex Stinton - [8 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/agents_of_mayhem)\\n\\n>Few would consider the combat in the various Saints Row games particularly memorable, so it\\'s surprising to discover that the frantic, fast paced battles and excellent agent switching gameplay end up being the true heroes of Agents of Mayhem. While it\\'s disappointing that the open world feels surplus to requirements at times, it\\'s the 80s cartoon atmosphere and absorbing upgrade system that also help ensure that this is more than just a Saints Row spin-off.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**Rock, Paper, Shotgun** - John Walker - [No Verdict](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review/)\\n\\n>For whatever reason, this feels like a game that wants to reach as high and far as the games that came before it, and simply can\\'t.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**Spaziogames** - Paolo Gimondi - *Italian* - [7.5 / 10.0](https://www.spaziogames.it/recensioni_videogiochi/console_multi_piattaforma/21231/agents-of-mayhem-la-recensione-dello-shooter-hero-based-di-volition.aspx)\\n\\n>Agents of Mayhem is an interesting experiment, but with short legs. While on one hand we have twelve agents all different and fun to use in fast-paced and dynamic gameplay mechanics, on the other hand we have a gameplay experience ruined mostly for the repetition of missions background and the copious presence of bugs And glitch ready to let you start over again a great run.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**Stevivor** - Steve Wright - [5 / 10.0](http://stevivor.com/reviews/agents-of-mayhem-review-one-dimensional-and-juvenile/)\\n\\n>Agents will lose most with its humour, juvenile, distracting and frustrating.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**TheSixthAxis** - Aran Suddi - [5 / 10](http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review/)\\n\\n>Agents of Mayhem is a step back for Volition after the success of the Saints Row series. While the characters are good and fun, they don\\'t feel larger than life when compared to The Boss and their crew. There aren\\'t as many memorable moments either, and the city of Seoul is wasted. The game is less Agents of Mayhem and more Agents of Mehhem.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**Total Gaming Network** - Shawn Zipay - [2 / 5 stars](http://totalgamingnetwork.com/content.php?6911-Review-in-Progress-Agents-of-Mayhem-(PC))\\n\\n>At its worst, Agents of Mayhem is an extremely watered down Crackdown and at its best it\\'s a moderately watered down Saints Row experience. The game\\'s positives just aren\\'t enough to make up for the rest of the game\\'s shortcomings.(...) With so many better alternatives out there, some of them even made by Volition themselves already, there just isn\\'t much of a reason to choose Agents of Mayhem.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**TrustedReviews** - Brett Phipps - [2.5 / 5 stars](http://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/agents-of-mayhem)\\n\\n>Agents of Mayhem would have been a great rental in days gone by, but today it\\'s an experience that\\'s great for a a short while, but doesn\\'t offer enough to keep players invested for the duration of the campaign.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**Twinfinite** - Ishmael Romero - [4 / 5.0](http://twinfinite.net/2017/08/agents-of-mayhem-review/)\\n\\n>I\\'ll be honest. I expected to come out of Agents of Mayhem wishing that Volition simply made Saints Row V instead. But now? Now I\\'m looking forward to what other trouble this budding agency can get itself into, and that\\'s saying something.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**USgamer** - Mike Williams - [3.5 / 5 stars](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/agents-of-mayhem-review)\\n\\n>Agents of Mayhem is a step back from the trippy, superpowered hijinks of Saints Row IV and Gat Out of Hell. The cast is colorful and eventually, you\\'ll open up the game enough that you\\'ll have fun, but for a Saints Row veteran, you\\'ll always feel like a little bit is missing. There a definite highlights here and there, but otherwise Agents of Mayhem treads water most of the time. Fun, but not amazing.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**Victory Point** - Unknown - [4 / 5 stars](http://www.vpdaily.com/agents-mayhem-review-maximum-mayhem/)\\n\\n>Agents of Mayhem had a lot to live up to with a built franchise like Saints Row, but I feel the spinoff accomplishes its goal and more. The open world was a fun world to play with and the story is very charming and enjoyable. The only real flaw with the game is it can drop in frame rates and there were a few bugs that required me to restart the game but none of that was a deal breaker.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n**Xbox Achievements** - Richard Walker - [70%](http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/agents-of-mayhem/review/)\\n\\n>Agents of Mayhem is a solid shooter with a neat character switching mechanic and an infectious sense of fun. It\\'s biggest problem is an over-reliance on sending you into samey-looking lairs, performing the same hacking mini-game ad infinitum, and engaging in much the same activities over and over again. At its best when you\\'re in the midst of a frantic battle, Agents of Mayhem grows very repetitive, very fast, but scratch beneath its surface, and you\\'ll find hidden depths. There\\'s also something strangely compulsive – almost hypnotically so – about playing AoM. Let it get its hooks into you and you\\'ll likely be pursuing 100%. Simple, straightforward, fun, it\\'s hard to resist.\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'comments': ['Looks like the common theme among the more negative reviews (and even some positive ones) is that the open world is bland, which a few previewers picked up on.\\n\\nGood to see that the gameplay seems pretty well received, at least.', 'Stevivor\\'s review is pretty oddly written. It\\'s basically just \"I hated Saints Row IV and hopefully everyone else hates Saints Row IV as much as I do, and also I\\'m upset because gay marriage isn\\'t legal in Australia and this game has a Ministry of Pride.\"\\n\\nI firmly believe that reviewers should have the freedom to express their honest opinion on a game, but sometimes I find myself thinking, \"You and your baggage are clearly not suited to review this game.\" It\\'d be like someone devoting significant parts of their GTA review to how stealing cars is wrong and anyone who has liked any GTA game is hopefully part of a dying minority.', \"Huh, I didn't even know this game is being released.
