I paid ca 270 CHF with Twint, would never have thought that someone is so stupid to use Twint for scams like this. The device was never delivered to me, and the vendor account miraculously disappeared from [tutti.ch](https://tutti.ch). Tutti staff told me they could not disclose anything, but recommended I should reach out to the police. Later on I found out that the phone number to which I had twinted actually was registered on the web as being owned by scammers. Sadly, I had not thought of checking that upfront. But beyond sadly, this also means that same phone number had been in use for fraud for >1 year, and [tutti.ch](https://tutti.ch) apparently has no automated checks in place to check phone numbers of vendors.\\n\\nWent to the police, told my story. Very nice experience, I must say, really friendly people.\\n\\nThen I expected that nothing would happen. Money gone, for sure the Swiss police would have something better to do than run after my 270 CHF.\\n\\nTo my surprise, one week later I received a letter from the authorities. Two names were listed. I could decide if I wanted to open an official prosecution against them. Which I did.\\n\\nToday, roughly 1.5 years later, I received a letter stating that the Swiss state attorney is going to indict them for commercial fraud in several hundred known cases. To my knowledge, punishment in Switzerland for commercial fraud can be max 10 years in prison. Obviously, that's the maximum, and there's only very little chance this will be the verdict. But, hey, the f\\\\*ers will be put in front of a proper court, where they belong.\\n\\nI am writing this just to encourage others who have become the target of fraud on [tutti.ch](https://tutti.ch).

I am really careful but this time I was buying skis that attach to my Thule kid trailer to use it for cross country skiing. Never in my life would I have expected to be scammed since I wasn‘t trying to buy a Rolex, Playstation, Gucci bag etc. I sent the amount upfront by bank transfer. After waiting 2 weeks and finally realizing I‘ve been scammed, I wrote Tutti and they replied that the account has been blocked for different suspicious activities and they are sorry. I sent this information to my bank and asked them if they could cancel the bank transfer - which they could. A few days later I had my money back (minus 20 CHF Bearbeitungsgebühr). Amazing!', 'I also got scammed, twice, on Tutti. The first time, I went to the police in Ticino and they shrugged their shoulders. Eventually they suggested I could write a letter to the ministry of justice in Lugano. I decided to do it, meticulously, giving all the evidence I had. They finally replied back that I had been very dumb to fall for it and I should pay more attention next time. \\n\\nI had never been so disappointed in Swiss authorities and Switzerland in general. That is also why I decided not to do anything after I got scammed the second time years later. I just stopped using Tutti for anything except selling stuff myself or occasionally buying in person. \\nI am very glad to hear that it worked out for you, though, and that at least some of these turds got what they deserved.']}]"
