Mom was fine with it, as she did expect that foodpanda will take a cut despite not being informed beforehand how much that cut would be. We still haven't signed anything. \\n\\nFast forward today, foodpanda wanted to do some kind of promotion. Mom said she doesn't want it and asked how much more she had to earn to cover the initial fee so that she can start getting an income from foodpanda.\\n\\nLo and behold, she never will because foodpanda also charge a monthly platform fee for using their services and her 'debt' to foodpanda has ballooned to rm140. This would not be a problem if we were informed there was a monthly rent, but we never were. Mom also never saw any contract and therefore, never signed any.\\n\\nSo I ask for help from those in the know regarding Malaysian commercial law and contract law, is there a way to bring them to court?
