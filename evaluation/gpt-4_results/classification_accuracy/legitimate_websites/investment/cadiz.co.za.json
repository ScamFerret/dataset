Here’s my case for asset management.\\n\\nI’m an analyst for an institutional investor. Occasional long hours but it’s by choice not expectation. Everyone wants our business so they are will to provide a ton of industry/market research. If you’re interested in learning you have unlimited access to the best resources. I constantly receive conference and networking invites. We get fund pitches from top firms and executives. People talk about IB/PE connections but my second day on the job I went to dinner with a billionaire CEO where I was able to pick his brain. My friend in IB is lucky if he gets to talk to his firm’s MDs let alone industry leaders. \\n\\nIt’s not all sunshine and rainbows but the good far outweigh the bad. Sometimes I feel like I hacked the system. Interested if I am lucky or if others in AM feel similar? \\n\\nBackground- Non-target state school. Aggressively loaded up on extra curriculars.

Totally agree, the lifestyle balance while making good money is unbeatable.  Especially working full remote\", \"Sounds like we have very similar roles. I'm on my 8th year and some potential negative points to consider:\\n\\n\\\\- You definitely have to check your ego. As an asset allocator if you are taking meetings with people that aren't smarter than you, you're probably doing it wrong.  I've seen incoming analysts have a hard time with this rationalization. I am a generalist so run the gamut between all asset classes and industry specialization. Lots of meetings are for the purpose of learning or making investments in niches that you shouldn't know more than the counterparty.\\n\\n\\\\- It can get pretty stale once you get the lay of the land and are able to touch everything. I'm starting to get to that point now where the feedback loop does not introduce any new challenges. Ofc any job can be like this but it can be particularly true here, I've sat in on industry webinars/conference breakouts where the primary topic of discussion was how to develop new carrots to continue challenging employees. Being a self starter is very important and there's eventually an aspect where you are only doing work for yourself that might not be lauded or even seen by your peers (e.g. creating a new model/analysis on one of your coverage managers to help you better understand their strategy/performance).\\n\\n\\\\- There's not a lot of room at the top. Only one CIO position, and often times these types of shops run pretty lean. There's someone here who is a good 20yrs my senior but only one title above for no other real reason than there's not really any true rungs to move up on.\\n\\nI'm at upper associate level in HCOL making \\\\~160k salary with discretionary bonus that ranges from solid (30-40%) to awful (15%) depending on the sponsoring institution's performance (i.e. the operating company itself's performance, not a bank). My bonus is not currently dependent on asset performance but the team is fighting to change that which would really change the firepower and potential here. Prob underpaid a good 10-20% right now but am due and superiors know this.
