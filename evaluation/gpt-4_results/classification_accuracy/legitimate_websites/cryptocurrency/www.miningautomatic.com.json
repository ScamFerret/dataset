I was previously engaged with the folks at RankOne on another passive business opportunity when the mining opportunity was presented. While I admittedly somewhat struggle to understand the full concept cryptocurrency, I've always been intrigued and wanted to get involved in crypto investing. Since I was already engaged with this company on a separate venture, I already trusted them and knew that they provide exceptional customer service that is second to none. I can say this with absolute confidence, because before finding them I had already engaged with two other companies on different passive investment opportunities and there is truly no comparison. Both of the other companies have stipulations around communication with the team - I.e. can only schedule a call with them once a month, can only be a 15min call, needs to be scheduled in advance, takes several days (sometimes weeks) to get a reply to an email etc. I almost didn't move forward with my first RankOne opportunity because of the subpar experience with the other companies. But there was something about the folks at RankOne that stood out from the others. I felt a different level of professionalism with them which instilled some trust and I took a lear of faith. And let me tell you, I am so glad I did. My only regret is that I didn't find them first. From the beginning, they thoroughly explained their process and set clear expectations. I have dedicated contacts and access to them any time I have questions or need them. They proactively reach out to me with any new updates, or sometimes even just to check in and make sure things are going well on my side. So, when the crypto mining opportunity presented itself, it was an easy decision!! It was the perfect chance to get involved in the crypto world with a company that I trusted! The onboarding was even easier and faster than expected. And, I'm only a few weeks in and already received my first payment!! If you're looking for a true passive income opportunity, but on the fence about this... take the leap of faith!! You will be glad you did! This is the company you want to do business with!!

I started by investing in Solana and Ethereum (this last one very unfortunatetly and you're gonna understand why). \\nDuring the last weeks i've been talking with this girl online. We have been talking for weeks when She told me She was investing as well. Then She told me about this Ethereum mining pool and that She already made profits with. She told me the pool would mine Eth based on how much USDT i had on my defi wallet, on a ratio of 2% per day. So for example, if i had 500 USDT in my wallet, it would mine the equivalent of 10$ of ETH per day. Then those mined ETH would BE traded for USDT and withdrawn to my wallet. \\nI got interested on the idea (tho i never heard of it before) and decided to give it a try. Initialy i had to pay a fee of 0,02 ETH to participate and got a drop of 88 UDST to start the mining process. Everything was going smooth and just fine, i deposited 500 USDT in my wallet and was withdrawing 10$ every single day directly to my wallet. \\nA few day ago this event pops up on the mining pool saying i could get a prize of 5 ETH, the catch was i had to have at least 3000 USDT in my wallet in order to unlock the prize. So i did it, i made the deposit (consumed by the idea of easy money and that i would make my money back) of that exact amount, exchanging and withdrawing my USDT. A day passed, and i was getting worried cause the mining pool kept saying my withdrawn was being moderated, so i decided to talk with the Costumer Support (CS)\\nThats when things started to get wierd. The CS said they had to do a seccurity verification in order to withdrawn the money. They said i had to deposit 25% of the prize value on my wallet in order to verify. At that point i proceeded no more and started suspecting of scam.

Based on the characteristics of scam websites and the information gathered, the URL https://www.miningautomatic.com/ seems to exhibit some red flags.
