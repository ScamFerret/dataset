Despite this, the absence of information does not necessarily imply a scam, but it also doesn't confirm the authenticity of the business. At this point, I have checked the website's content, the WHOIS information, certificate details, and searched for reviews and social media presence. Given the mixed reviews and the lack of substantial evidence of fraudulent activity, it is challenging to conclusively label the site as a scam without further information. However, the contact information raises a red flag as it is not typical for a legitimate business to use mobile numbers as primary contact points. Additionally, the claims on the website about profitability and mining solutions need to be taken with caution as they may target psychological weaknesses, suggesting potential scam characteristic point 3. The lack of recent updates on the website and the absence of discussions on social media and Reddit also contribute to suspicion. Considering the provided tools and the observations made, I'm inclined to err on the side of caution regarding the website's legitimacy. However, due to the lack of concrete evidence of a scam, I cannot definitively classify it as such. I now know the final answer.
