This is by no means an exhaustive list, I decided to limit myself to 10 people, somewhat arbitrarily, to ensure this post didn\\'t take too long to pull together. I would love it if you, reading this can use this thread to add other women who I\\'ve missed that deserve some recognition. Anyway, my 10 picks - in the order I happened to think of them:\\n\\n------\\n\\n**Pooja Ranjan**\\n\\nIf you want to know what is currently going on in Ethereum development then Pooja should probably be your first source. If you only follow her sites listed below you will understand more than 99% of crypto users. Do be aware it isn\\'t aimed at complete newbies, it\\'s for people who already have a bit of familiarity with the chain and want to stay as up to date as possible without needing to spend 25 hours a day following the progress of different teams, EIPs, discussions etc. If you know a little about Ethereum already and want to have the best \\'alpha\\' on what is coming, without any shilling/hype etc, there is probably no better follow.\\n\\n Ethereum Cat Herders \\n\\n * Ethereum Cat Herders: https://www.ethereumcatherders.com/\\n\\n * https://www.youtube.com/@ethcatherders/playlists\\n\\n * Etherworld: https://www.etherworld.co/\\n\\n\\n------\\n\\n**Mary Maller**\\n\\nDr Maller is a ZK researcher at the Ethereum Foundation; and not \\'researcher\\' as in *\"I did my own research by watching someone shill their shitcoin on Youtube\"*, but \\'researcher\\' as in *\"constantly publishing in academic journals on cutting edge cryptographic topics\"*. We are already starting to see the early excitement build up around ZKEVMs and other zero knowledge projects, the odds are that any you happen upon will be built on top of mathematics that Mary has contributed to.\\n\\n * https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gzHDMSYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao\\n\\n * Scalability Solutions from zk SNARKs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4UfD4Mp6EM\\n\\n * The Roaring Twenties: Recent Advances in Zero-Knowledge Proofs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZAOt6_fZ1k\\n\\n------\\n\\n**Anett Rolikova**\\n\\nSelf-described \\'Ethereum Sunshine\\', Anett has contributed to a bunch of projects, probably the most useful to me personally being her \\'curated crypto list\\', which serves as an unbeatable starting place for anyone getting started in their Ethereum journey. Someone linked me to this list about 4 years ago and it was fundamental in making the task of getting to grips with Ethereum manageable. If you\\'re feeling overwhelmed at the challenge of comprehending what this whole space is about: you want to learn more but don\\'t know where to start then the answer is here:\\n \\n * https://github.com/anettrolikova/Crypto\\n\\nShe has also been an events organizer for the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians, written the NFT Standards Documentation and made a bunch of other contributions.\\n\\n * https://medium.com/ethereum-magicians/ethereum-l2-future-by-ethereum-magicians-cd62cefa0fe7\\n\\n * https://www.nftstandards.wtf/NFT+Standards+Wiki+-+READ.me\\n\\n * Why ERC721 sucks and we need a new NFT standard [ETHCC 5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPk46oT1nt8\\n\\n------\\n\\n**Camila Russo**\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t heard of Cami Russo yet, then it is very likely that you will in the next year or so. She has written a book on the early days of Ethereum called *\\'The Infinite Machine\\'* which is currently being made into a movie by Ridley Scott\\'s studio... yea that Ridley Scott studios, who also produced Alien, Gladiator, Bladerunner and some of the other most popular movies of all time! The story is pretty fascinating, and when the movie comes out it should take Ethereum another big step towards wider recognition in the general public.\\n\\n * https://thedefiant.io/scott-free-infinite-machine\\n\\nShe also founded and runs one of the most trustworthy crypto news sources - The Defiant. It focuses on DeFi, with plenty of developer interviews, use and presentation of on-chain data, etc etc:\\n\\n * https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/the-defiants-definitive-guide-to\\n\\n------\\n\\n**Anna Rose**\\n\\nAnna Rose is one of the main links between the highly academic world of Zero Knowledge research and the average, less technically specialized user.

Anna\\'s content will give you the knowledge to know your SNARKs from your STARKs, and your PLONK from your Plonky2, so you can have a better chance of picking the really promising projects from those that just have a big marketing budget or desperate bagholders.\\n\\n * Zero Knowledge: Privacy and Transparency\\'s Beautiful Co-existence [DevCon 5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wMoV8G2118\\n\\n------\\n\\n**Frederika Ernst**\\n\\nDr Ernst is a host of Epicentre, one of the most well researched and non-shilly crypto podcasts. Their guests are industry leading builders and thinkers, but the hosts always push back on any unsubstantiated claims and demand further explanation of anything that sounds unlikely or overly optimistic. They have always done their research and the questions asked demonstrate a level of understanding that makes it almost impossible for the listener to come away without learning from every episode. You should be a listener if you want a general crypto podcast that never seems like the guests are just being allowed to hype up their projects.\\n\\n * https://epicenter.tv/hosts/friederike-ernst/\\n\\nShe is also the COO of Gnosis, the scaling solution formerly known as xDAI, that POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) run on. POAPs are collectable badges that have become an integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem, if you watch a big event live (like The Merge) then you can usually get a POAP, if you participate in a DAO governance call then you can usually get a POAP, if you go to an Ethereum conference then you will probably end up with a walletful of POAPs! Gnosis is also home to plenty of other dApps, a nicely decentralized staking community and all the usual sort of things a sidechain would want.\\n\\n * Gnosis Chain: Extending Ethereum [ETHCC 5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYVOE3P08eU\\n\\n------\\n\\n**Jinglan Wang**\\n\\nJinglan is a Co-Founder and the Chief Executive Officer of Optimism, currently the second biggest Ethereum L2, recently in the news for a partnership with Coinbase over the Optimism Stack, and pioneers in retroactive public goods funding, DAO governance, and a series of massive airdrops to L2 users/Gitcoin donors/DAO participants etc. Disclaimer, I\\'m a delegate to Optimism and a Citizen\\'s House badgeholder, so I won\\'t go on about how great the project is as I\\'m definitely a biased source.\\n\\n * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8ycNV0lF5M\\n\\nShe is also a founder and advisor to the Blockchain Education Network, one of the biggest outreach programs in crypto, helping schools, clubs etc around the world teach people about this new technology.\\n\\n * https://www.blockchainedu.org/\\n\\n------\\n\\n**Taylor Monahan**\\n\\nIf you were around in Ethereum before \\'The DAO\\' or joined any time up to the first ICO mania then you are pretty likely to remember Taylor, even if you didn\\'t know here name. She was one of the founders of the first easy to use Ethereum wallet (My Ether Wallet), before which we had to wait to sync the chain before making transactions (was that Parity, Myst, ?, I don\\'t remember). This was an absolute game changer and allowed many more people to start accessing Ethereum... just in time for them to faced with a barrage of new \\'Initial Coin Offerings\\', investments with varying degrees of legitimacy. As well as being partially responsible for enabling the chaos that ensued, Taylor also took it upon herself to try and call out scams and terrible investment \\'opportunities\\' that newbies were falling for. If you look her up on Twitter you\\'ll see that she still is still doing this, though now working for the ecosystem\\'s current main wallet Metamask.\\n\\n * How to Avoid Crypto Scams: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiYYQCs49VM\\n\\n * The Original Sin [DevCon 6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OnxjlA-RKA\\n\\n------\\n\\n**Pulja Ohlhaver**\\n\\nPulja has become well more know in the Ethereum community following the publication of the paper \\'Decentralized Society: Finding Web3\\'s Soul\\', of which she is a co-author. This was what sparked the conversations around soul-bound tokens and their uses in the middle of last year, it also talks about the state and future of many aspects of the space that are key to governance, such as Sybil resistance, quadratic funding and social recovery wallets, all of which are becoming increasingly important in DAOs and Web 3.0 in general.\\n\\n * https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763\\n\\nShe is a big picture / long game thinker for what the crypto ecosystem could become, if we can navigate our way there without falling into corporate/governmental control on one side of the ridge or fraudsters and scams on the other. If you haven\\'t read the paper yet then I highly recommend it, or at the very least listen to her explain it.\\n\\n * Bottom up Building: Pathways towards a Decentralized Society [DevCon 6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JpBmA-8FVc\\n\\nLike everyone else on this list, Pulja has a variety of other contributions, such as being the Strategy Counsel at FlashBots (the MEV research and development organization).\\n\\n * https://www.flashbots.net/\\n\\n------\\n \\n**Simona Pop**\\n\\nSimona is a DAO governance and public good thought-leader and advocate; a key contributor to Gitcoin (the biggest public goods funding platform in the ecosystem) and the organizer of Schelling Point (probably the biggest \\'regen\\' conference). She was also a co-founder of \\'Bounties Network\\', a platform similar(ish) to \\'Fiver\\' for Web3.0 where freelancers can be paid for doing everything from finding a bug in some code, translating documentation t another language or even planting a tree... she\\'s one of the many people in Ethereum community working hard to realize a vision of a better future, by building it.\\n\\n * https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/pop/activity/topics\\n \\n * https://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co/info\\n \\n * DAOs and Biomimicry [DevCon 6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0I5dkkpJ9o\\n\\n------\\n\\nSo over to you I guess, who have I missed?', 'comments': [\"I'm thankful for anyone making a contribution, because their sex is irrelevant in that regard\", 'Wow, cool list', 'Harriet tubman', 'Don’t forget the Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation too!', 'This is awesome, thanks!!']}, {'title': \"Bonus Mission ideas for Paris, Colorado, Hawke's Bay and Colombia.\", 'subreddit': 'HiTMAN', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/dmyqgn/bonus_mission_ideas_for_paris_colorado_hawkes_bay/', 'selftext': 'In light of IO’s admission that highly requested “time of day” changes for certain maps are not on the table, some of my favorite bonus mission concepts are no longer valid (i.e. 4th of July celebration in Miami, city wide power outage in Mumbai)... so here are new ideas for some of the maps which do not require a change to the time of day, but could have a minor adjustment the the lighting/skyboxes for mood.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Paris- “Eye of the Beholder”** \\n\\n*Synopsis:* An Art Gallery/Artifact Exhibit and Auction is being held at the Palais de Walewska. Your targets are a trio of high class thieves intending to make off with an invaluable historical document. The document has been replaced with a fake, as the Exhibit Curator knows of the plot to steal it and has set a trap, with the fake document as bait, and the ICA\\'s top assassin as the predator - and have these thieves erased once and for all. 47 must use his above-human powers of observation to identify and eliminate the thieves. \\n\\n*Layout:* The runway in the main central area is still in place but all other traces of the Fashion Show have been removed, with various art exhibits, display stands and cases for exhibits and other items in their place. The entire Palace is on display for the guests of the Exhibits, with the exception of the basement area (staff only) and the top floor/attic. The Auction area from The Showstopper is still in use, except they are bidding on a selection of valuable art and artifacts that are among the other items on display. Guests wander the courtyards around the exterior, just enjoying the beautiful Paris evening. CICADA is once again providing security for the Palace. The Attic is being utilized more as a proper security hub now, with one of the side rooms now set up as a guard break room. Several guards overlook the main show floor from the balconies. A security camera mainframe can be found up here as well. The basement security room is also used and a security camera mainframe can be found here as well, however the room is more highly secured now with its own security camera looking over it, and the camera mainframe has been moved to the other end of the room. \\n\\nThis mission makes more thorough use of the other areas and rooms of the palace. Tracking down the targets is not as laborious as it may sound - their suspicious behavior and disguises will be comically apparent to 47 but somehow not anybody else.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Colorado- “Spirits of Vengeance”** \\n\\nSynopsis: A team of fraudulent “ghost hunters” with an extremely popular internet video channel has honed in on the abandoned Apricot Farm in Colorado, after hearing the urban legends about a series of mysterious deaths that befell 4 members of a militia that once resided there. Instead of merely filming their fake ghost hunting shenanigans, they’re hosting a massive Halloween party on the premises as well. The client was formerly one of the two creators of the ghost hunting series, but was ousted by his partner after objecting to the staged hauntings that his partner had been arranging. The client, wealthy from years of internet stardom, has put up the money to have his former partner as well a the two crew members that were complicit in the ousting eliminated partly out of revenge - but this isn\\'t purely about revenge. The client discovered shortly after the ousting that his former business partner was directly responsible for the drug-fueled car accident that claimed the life of the client\\'s girlfriend, and two of the show\\'s crew members share a portion of the blame, as well. The client wants all three responsible parties eliminated at the Halloween Party at the old Apricot Farm.\\n\\nLayout: The Map is fundamentally the same as in the Freedom Fighters missions, but with an added layer of disrepair - the militia grabbed what they could and left after the deaths of Rose, Berg, Parvatti and Graves. Some of their equipment such as computer servers and that big ram thing remains, the stuff that was too big to pack up in a hurry, but it\\'s all disused and shut down. Signs of rooms being hastily packed off are present, with trash left behind and furniture askew. Elaborate Halloween Decorations have been placed all over, including spooky vines hanging from trees, tombstones, pumpkins, skeletons, fog machines and more. There are portable toilets dotted around the property. The big red barn functions as a bar, serving food and drinks. The dummies inside the limo have been replaced with fake skeletons dangling out of the windows. The loft area is the staging area for the on-site security (provided by CICADA) and includes a security camera mainframe. Guests mill about the property, some exploring, others hanging out and drinking. The auto shop and attached building is empty and unused. The smaller barn next to it has had couches set up inside and serves as a lounge. The Farm House is locked up and off limits to guests, as this is where the \"ghost hunt\" will be filmed - but 47 can slip in and give the ghost hunters a REAL scare. In the basement of the house are several boxes containing belongings of Rose, Berg, Parvatti, and Graves, and on top is a wearable disguise - a red and black flannel jacket, a wig, and a white face mask that resembles Ezra Berg.\\n\\nThis mission is meant to give a new take on Colorado as a map- One of its biggest criticisms is that it\\'s too hostile of a map to really have fun with, so here we have a mission that removes the armed militia populating the map and replaces them with normal civilians, allowing players to more casually explore and play around. I also really like the idea of revisiting a place that 47 has been to and seeing how things have changed since his mission.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Hawke’s Bay- “The Human Inferno”** \\n\\nSynopsis: An illegitimate festival involving the burning of a massive effigy representing human greed is taking place on the now abandoned remote beachfront property in Hawke’s Bay, formerly occupied by Alma Reynard. Your target is the organizer of the event, who has already taken payment from many eager party-goers that arrived only to find provisions and utilities very limited and inadequate for the number of people in attendance - and ultimately, not much to do other than stand around. This happens to be the second sham event put on by this organizer, and the client, the son of a wealthy film producer and previous victim of the festival scam, feels this to be the appropriate time and place to exact revenge on the organizer, who can be found milling about the abandoned house, or participating in the lighting of the effigy.\\n\\nLayout: The house has had most of its contents removed with some folding chairs and tables brought in as well as other temporary provisions. A large portable generator outside provides power to the entire building (which can be shut down to plunge the house into total darkness). The Organizer\\'s security protects the house, and he has two guards that flank him at all times. The beach \"party\" takes place a safe distance away from the house and consists mostly of a bunch of people standing around, complaining about the event\\'s lack of activities. There are some cheap speakers set up playing a few songs and a number of drunken people doing their best to enjoy themselves by dancing, some people are making the most of the situation by building sand castles, most everyone else is playing on their phones, hanging out near their vehicles, or huddling around the bonfire. The large wooden effigy is poorly constructed, made of driftwood and garbage, and only vaguely resembles a man. 47 can arrange for the Effigy to collapse onto the Organizer shortly after he has lit the fire. \\n\\nThis map makes additional use of Hawke\\'s Bay in possibly the only way it can - a beach party. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Colombia- \"Cleaning House\"**\\n\\nSynopsis: In the absence of the authoritative presence of the Delgados, an oppressive regime of a private Colombian Militia has quietly taken over the town of Santa Fortuna, cutting off all communications with the outside world and barring its citizens - and visitors - from leaving. A third party interested in developing Santa Fortuna into a vacation town has put up a large sum of money to have the militia cleared out, after having failed to gain the attention of Colombian government toward the matter. Apparently, they have written off Santa Fortuna for decades and have no interest in worrying about it. The Client has offered the ICA $2,000,000 to eliminate the leader of the militia, and an optional $50,000 bonus for each of the 20 elite members of the militia - these are regarded as OPTIONAL targets. Standard militia soldiers are not included and should be regarded as non-targets. \\n\\nLayout: The map now has militia blockades at every road leading out, and mines in the water preventing boats from coming or going. Militia have locked everything and everyone down, and civilians mostly stay indoors. The caves now contain holding cells for detained citizens and unfortunate tourists alike. Delgado\\'s mansion servers as the homestead for the militia hierarchy and is guarded exclusively by a team of 20 highly trained elite militia soldiers. The standard soldiers secure the perimeter of the mansion but are not allowed on the premises. 47 can trigger events to draw out the milita elite and the leader, but a covert assault on the mansion is another option.\\n\\nThis mission is meant to loosen the restraints on the player a bit, allowing an opportunity to engage in a shootout if they so choose, with only the militia elite, and still retain a silent assassin ranking as long as the shootout happens within the confines of the mansion - where the standard soldiers who guard the perimeter and patrol the town cannot hear the gunshots.', 'comments': ['As Always,Great Concepts.', 'I just read this then went to colorado for the scarecrow pack and started to see it all working.\\n\\nI would have the main opening to the party be tge gatr where the quad bike keys are. The barricades would be left and used as small ticket stands. The area at the back where Penelope Graves goes first would be where a tech crew would be set-up. The barn with the firing range would be changed to a hunted house. The main house would be a VIP party area. The firing range would have a bar where the safe was and so much more.\\n\\nWould love all of these but completly doubt that these will be put in.', \"These are cool. The one I'd most want would be Paris turned into a museum. It *is* a Museum normally so it'd be really cool to get a version of the map converted back into that function. A calmer, quieter evening for Paris would be awesome especially if you could make Contracts in it. One change I'd make is that I like the idea of the leader of the thieves being unknown. You can ascertain his identity by following the other two known thieves around, listening in on their clues, etc. Or by accessing their computer after acquiring the password. That way, there's a mystery to unravel, at least for the first play through and then subsequently, you can just immediately dispatch him if you don't want to go through the process of 'figuring' out who it is.\\n\\nThat one also seems to incorporate the least amount of changes, too; rather than adding a bunch of new stuff or even already made Halloween pieces to the map like the Colorado one, they'd mostly be removing all the fashion show pieces. Then they'd just take the various displays already found throughout and duplicate them so you can move about the floors and see people looking at art. Now, yes, there would be new dialogue ideally; comments about art and the crowds would also need to be reorganized since the catwalk is gone and you want to fill that space with art enthusiasts or wealthy individuals but it still seems like the simplest to make.\", 'I remember writing about a bonus mission on colorado as well, it would be a regular farm, with maybe some auctioning happening to have some extra npcs around, 2-3 targets in a family that had some dark secret (the reason for the contract) etc. I really like these bonus mission ideas.']}, {'title': 'Decred Journal – August 2018', 'subreddit': 'decred', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9dn9ia/decred_journal_august_2018/', 'selftext': '_Note: you can read this on [GitHub (link)](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/201808), [Medium (link)](https://medium.com/decred/decred-journal-august-2018-48bdb4fb14f) or [old Reddit (link)](https://old.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9dn9ia/decred_journal_august_2018/) to see all the links._\\n\\n# Development\\n\\n[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): Version 1.3.0 RC1 (Release Candidate 1) is out!

Do not try to send such small fee transactions just yet, until the majority of the network upgrades.\\n\\nRelease process was [changed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1414) to use release branches and bump version on the master branch at the beginning of a release cycle. Discussed in [this chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$153487143956936pmKTp:decred.org).\\n\\nThe codebase is ready for the new Go 1.11 version. Migration to vgo module system is complete and the 1.4.0 release will be built using modules. The list of versioned modules and a hierarchy diagram are available [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/README.md#GoModules).\\n\\nThe testnet was reset and bumped to version 3.\\n\\nComments are welcome for the [proposal](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1412) to implement smart fee estimation, which is important for Lightning Network.\\n\\n@matheusd recorded a code review [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eysGWVhDFWY) for new Decred developers that explains how tickets are selected for voting.\\n\\n[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): Version [1.3.0 RC1](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.0-rc1) features new SPV sync mode, new ticket buyer, new APIs for Decrediton and a host of bug fixes. On the dev side, dcrwallet also [migrated](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1238) to the new module system.\\n\\n[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): Version [1.3.0 RC1](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.3.0-rc1) adds the new SPV sync mode that syncs roughly 5x faster. The feature is off by default while it receives more testing from experienced users. Other notable changes include a design polish and experimental Politeia integration.\\n\\n[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): Proposal editing is [being developed](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/515) and has a [short demo](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1032753235927425024). This will allow proposal owners to edit their proposal in response to community feedback before voting begins. The challenges associated with this feature relate to updating censorship tokens and maintaining a clear history of which version comments were made  on. @fernandoabolafio produced this [architecture diagram](https://twitter.com/oxfernando/status/1033390103534751746) which may be of interest to developers.\\n\\n@degeri joined to perform security testing of Politeia and found [several issues](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Adegeri).\\n\\n[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): mainnet explorer upgraded to v2.1 with several new features.
