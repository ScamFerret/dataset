The lack of additional records such as MX (mail exchange) records is not necessarily a red flag, but it can sometimes be indicative of a less professional setup, especially for a business that would typically have a dedicated email service. Given the absence of strong evidence of a scam, but considering the red flags raised by the non-professional contact information and the lack of SSL certificate information, I am leaning towards a cautious approach. I now know the final answer based on the information gathered. Although there is not conclusive evidence of a scam, there are several red flags that suggest the website may not be entirely legitimate. These include the non-professional email, the lack of SSL certificate information, and the privacy-protected WHOIS information. Therefore, I will err on the side of caution in my final determination. The website https://lv-ex.com/ may not be a confirmed scam, but it exhibits several suspicious characteristics that warrant caution. Users are advised to be wary when engaging with this site.",
