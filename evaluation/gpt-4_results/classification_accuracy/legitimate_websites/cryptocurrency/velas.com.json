But me not being an AI person, GV seemed like a good middle ground because food reviews seem great and still sounds “upscale.”\\n\\nThat being said, what are tips for navigating the resort and getting the most out of our time? Looking into a family cooking class but are there other paid excursions I should be looking into (3 year old and 6 year old)?\\n\\nPlan on using a sitter for at least one night and making reservations for dinner beforehand (heard it’s slim pickings if you want until you get there). \\n\\nNever stayed at an AI, let alone one with a butler…what can they help with?\\n\\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thanks!', 'comments': ['Where to start. Well, let me say that we\\'ve gone back and forth from AI to ala carte over the years. Generally we find the hard product at ala carte places nicer, sometimes WAY nicer. Ala carte places seem to do a better job of scaling down in terms of physical size/capacity. Boutique, etc. Whereas AIs tend to be larger IME and it\\'s just that much tougher to make everything pristine and beautiful.\\n\\nAnyway, in terms of hard product, I\\'d say GV RM is fine enough for an AI in that regard.\\n\\nFood? This is the primary reason we go back and forth from AI to not. We\\'re NY/global foodies. And frankly, there\\'s not a resort on earth, AI or ala carte, that compares. There may be some quite good spots here and there. But not world class. So when going ala carte at $2000+/night or whatever, and then also being handed a bill for $150 for a very meh lunch or $500 for a meh dinner, it\\'s just stupid.\\n\\nSo of late we\\'ve reverted to AI because the food and service is more same-y than not in terms of quality and attentiveness (or lack thereof), except that I\\'m not reminded 2-3x/day how preposterously overpriced it is because it\\'s AI. And again, I\\'ll pay $1000/head for spectacular food and wine at a dinner. So it\\'s not about the price point per se. For these vacations, we just sort of accept that we\\'re not at all there for the food.\\n\\nAs for GV RM, the restaurants are \"fine\" and anyone who says better is not a foodie. As a rule they\\'re loud, mostly owed to the kids combined with poor design (tons of hard surfaces, super high ceilings on some spots) and the fact that there\\'s really only 1 seating. They spread it out from 5-7 with 8 sometimes doable, but for the most part you can\\'t eat at 9pm after all the kids are gone because they won\\'t seat you then.\\n\\nThey also practice some bizarre and terribly inefficient food service practices at dinner. Like two waiters per table/zone, except that they don\\'t communicate with one another, like, at all. So sometimes you get something brought to you twice, other times you have to ask both waiters multiple times, and still other times you wind up resorting (ha) to asking some other server who happens to walk past your table\\n\\nIf you do put your kids in the kids club, I\\'d do the opposite of what the other poster mentioned. The Zen pool is buggy bc it\\'s in the woods. Plus the shuttle back and forth to the oceanside is kind of annoying IMO. Spend time at the Grand Class pool. It\\'s adults only (hence kids -> kids club) and offers the most focused, attentive service in the resort. There are only something like 50-60 chaise lounges, not usually full even peak, with a handful of attendants. You can always catch there eye, but usually you\\'re asked before you need to.\\n\\nThe above may sound like a pan but it\\'s really not. We\\'ve gone each year in the lead up to Christmas for the last few years. Went from Ambassador to Grand Class when our kids were old enough for the latter. It\\'s an easy nonstop in/out of Cancun, the car service they facilitate (I forget the name...something like Blue Dreams?) is reliable (though don\\'t let them talk you into leaving 5 hours before your flight...), the Grand Class pool especially is relaxing and well attended, the food is \"fine\" and the beach nice enough.\\n\\nHappy to answer more specific questions if you have any. We were there just 6 weeks ago.', 'In our experience while they do take potty trained 3 year olds at the kids club it’s nice to come back to your room to your kids already sleeping so definitely recommend the babysitters.  I always try to give them all our babysitting nights right when we got there and requested that we get the same babysitter each night, was helpful for my 3 young kids not to be left with someone new each night. \\nWe love the main pool for the kids, the large shallow area is great for feeling like your kids can play on their own a bit but you’re not stuck in a designated kiddie area. \\nCheck out the spa for sure.  We’ve never felt the need to go on any excursions.  Food and drinks are good and completely edible but nothing really blows you away.  We’ve been 3 times and it’s always a wonderfully relaxing week. \\nWhile the Zen pool doesn’t outshine the main pool definitely check it out at least 1 day, I didn’t find the bugs to be an issue anywhere but maybe it depends on the time of year you go. \\nBring lots of smaller $ bills for tips.', 'I’ve been to Grand Velas many trips and love it. A few times with my son, who is now 12 and says the people are so nice and the service is amazing. It’s in his top for service with Borga Santandrea, Villa Agrippina Rome and Ashford Castle. \\n\\nI’ve never gone to the Zen area pool so can’t to speak to that. \\nIf your kids are at the kids club, I recommend that you go over to the pool at the Grand Class section for a bit, it’s 16 and older.\\n\\nThey do different activities during the stay, water polo, volley ball (water/beach), flag football, soccer, water Zumba. They don’t push it and are also very accommodating. Two of my trips they set up a rock wall, trampoline and food for a day by the ambassador pool. Kids and some adults took part. My son loved it. \\n\\nWe mentioned we liked playing games and went back to our room and they had set up games for us to play.\\n\\nRestaurants are all good about accommodating needs. One trip I was with a relative that asked for spaghetti pomodoro  in each restaurant and they did it. \\n\\nYou mentioned the Fairmont Mayakoba- spent 3 nights there last year and then went to Grand Velas. We stayed at one of beach front casitas. Butlers were amazing, one took by son out kayaking because I wasn’t up for it and my sister couldn’t go. \\n\\nEnjoy.', 'My husband and I took our parents and siblings for Christmas and had a fabulous time. We stayed in Zen. I recommend making your dinner reservations before arriving. The butler sent us a whatsapp every morning with the daily activities and confirmed any reservations we had. My husband wasn’t feeling great after the full travel day, so he texted to send him up some anti-nausea meds. Highly recommend the complimentary water therapy at the Zen Spa.', 'They let our 3 year old use the kids’ club there without a sitter, which was a pleasant surprise! She’s close to 4 and fully potty trained - you might ask!\\n\\nWe stayed in ambassador, but we honestly preferred the pool in the Zen section as it was always empty, the service was great, and the pools were super shallow so I didn’t have to get in with the kids (just sat by the pool instead - but the 3 year old and the older kid are both good swimmers anyway). Make sure to check it out at least. The spa is over there as well, which is how we ended up there - husband took the kids while I had a massage. \\n\\nMake sure to hit up the spa! It’s great. \\n\\nIf you have a family suite, have your concierge put the cute little teepee in the kids’ room. Our younger one loved it. \\n\\nThe resort is super nice and relaxing. The food is pretty good, especially for an AI. Our only complaint is that our concierge was laughably bad - so bad that it was kind of our running joke. In the grand scheme of things, it was not a big deal, but we were surprised because our concierge at their Cabo property was awesome. \\n\\nThe tasting dinner at Cocina de Autor is fun. If you do the wine pairings, be warned - they serve you a full big glass with each course. If you drink it all, you’ll be tanked. I held back and still had a headache the next day!\\n\\nThey have some fun Disney themed kids’ shows at night that my younger one really loved, too.']}, {'title': 'Grand Velas or Fairmont Mayakoba?', 'subreddit': 'cancun', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/cancun/comments/19fd2rv/grand_velas_or_fairmont_mayakoba/', 'selftext': 'Did a ton of research and booked Fairmont (all inclusive option) for our fam in July.
