The website promises unusually high returns, offers automated and AI trading systems, and promotes free copy trading, which could be enticing but potentially misleading. The WHOIS information shows the use of a privacy service and the website's relatively recent creation, which might be cause for concern. Mixed reviews were found online, with some positive feedback on Trustpilot but also a mention of a scam detection website. Additionally, there are complaints about discrepancies in accounts and difficulty closing accounts. Based on these observations, I am inclined to determine that the website is suspicious and may be a scam. However, without concrete evidence of fraudulent activities, such as confirmed reports of users being scammed, I cannot conclusively label it as such. Therefore, I will proceed with caution and suggest that potential users do thorough research and exercise due diligence before engaging with the website. I now know the final answer. The website itrustinvestment.com is suspicious and exhibits several characteristics of a scam website. However, without definitive proof of scam activities, it is recommended to approach with caution and conduct thorough research before any engagement.",
