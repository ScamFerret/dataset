In times of bigger market movements many of those sites will abandon trades that are not favorable for them.\\n\\nYou can use an aggregator like **Trocador.app (🔒 .onion/i2p)** that has a security bond for transactions of up to $1000 and gives you a clear indication about competitive pricing and KYC risk.

But as crypto history shows us, keeping \"your\" coins in the hands of a custodian is a 100% guarantee to set yourself and the community up for failure.\\n\\nIf you are in it for the gain, be smart and do it on-chain.\\n\\n\\n#What exchanges to use then?\\n\\nThere are plenty of better (more secure, private, trustless) however still more inconvenient solutions that are preferable over using KYC/CEX. Those often come at a higher price as security and privacy have a price, but not necessarily at a lower speed. Indeed starting from zero,  signing-up for a cumbersome and intimidating KYC process will often take days or weeks sometimes placing holds on funds while a P2P market like LocalMonero will give you access to coins <1 hour and coming at the benefit of not giving up your right to privacy.\\n\\n\\nExchange method | Exchanges| Trust level\\n---|---|----\\nDEX | bisq (🔒 .onion), Haveno (🔒 .onion)| ✅ escrow\\nP2P | LocalMonero (🔒 .onion).

I know there is one exchange and there are many buyers/sellers on localbitcoin vietnam. I also have read that you can hold sell or buy crypto but not exchange it for goods and services...\\n\\ni understand that the rules are changing as we speak but i am mainly concerned about smaller coins like XLM (stellar lumens) to be specific. I have a bunch of XLM but i cant seem to find anywhere officially sanctioned to sell them. local btc only does btc, and bitcoinVN.io doesnt support lumens anyways, would i get into trouble advertising sell offer online? would it be against the rules to offer it here? right now blockchain is doing an air drop and you can get 500 XLM free for verifying an account. there are people offering to buy them at a discount on other subs here on reddit. i just dont want to be breaking any rules but you can get 40$ paypal for 50$ worth of xlm that seems to be almost impossible to get rid of elsewhere in vietnam so its not the worst deal ... \\n\\nor you could just hodl and maybe XLM will hit the moon?\\n\\nanyways im not trying to solicit directly here. mods please tell me if this is against the rules and i will remove it right away but im a bit of a crypto evengelist and would like to see more of it in Vietnam and hopefully all above board too\\n\\nand yes i am aware of and ever vigilant against scams\\n\\nand dont pm me please. i will just block you\\n\\nim just looking for info, if you cant do it in public then i dont want it\\n\\ncảm ơn bạn\", 'comments': ['[deleted]']}]"

        "thought": "The search on Reddit did not provide specific information about bitcoinvn.io being a scam. However, there is a mention of BitcoinVN under the \"Medium\" risk category with the note \"no known incidents, own liquidity pool\" in one of the posts, which suggests that it does not have a history of scam reports. This is a positive sign. Given that the website is live, has a valid SSL certificate, and does not exhibit immediate signs of scam characteristics, and considering the Reddit information, I am ready to conclude my analysis. I now know the final answer The URL https://bitcoinvn.io/ may have some warning signs but does not conclusively meet the criteria for being labeled as a scam website based on the analysis conducted within the scope of the tools provided.",
