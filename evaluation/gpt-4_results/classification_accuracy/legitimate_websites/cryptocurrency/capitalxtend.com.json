However, the absence of a warning does not necessarily mean the absence of risk. It is still crucial to verify the license number and company details with the official FSC Mauritius database to confirm the legitimacy of the regulatory claims made by CapitalXtend. Given the observations so far, there are both positive and negative signs. Positive reviews exist, but these can sometimes be misleading. The high leverage offered and the bonuses can be red flags, but they also claim to be regulated, which is a good sign if true. The use of a privacy service for the domain registration is not conclusive on its own. Without access to the official FSC Mauritius database to verify the regulatory claims, a definitive conclusion cannot be reached. However, based on the available tools and the characteristics of scam websites, there is not enough evidence to categorically classify the website as a scam.
