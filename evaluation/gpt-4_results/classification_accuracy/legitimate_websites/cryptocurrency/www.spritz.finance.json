The domain was created on November 9, 2021, and is registered until November 9, 2024, which suggests some level of legitimacy as it's not a short-term registration.

However, the domain status of \"clientTransferProhibited\" is usually a sign of a legitimate domain as it prevents unauthorized transfers.

I live in New Jersey so I said no I did not. She asks me if I know a certain persons name and address, again I say I don\\'t know that person or address. She says ok there has been fraud on your account, we\\'re going to lock it down and take care of that for you, for your security we are going to send you a number through text, when you get that please read it back to me. The text comes and it says something to the effect of:\\n\\n\"Below is your temporary password. Please remember Verizon will never contact you to ask for this number.\\n\\n23482349 (bunch of random numbers)\"\\n\\nThankfully I read the full text. I said to the woman \"It says here Verizon will never contact me to ask for this number.\" She doesn\\'t miss a beat and responds with \"Yes we will only ask for that number when we call you before hand and tell you what we are doing, that is to prevent any scammers from getting their hands on it.\" So I responded \"Like you?\" She continued to go on saying how she works at Verizon and needs the number to prevent this fraud right away. I then hung up on her and called Verizon with the number from their website just to be sure there was no fraud, and of course there wasn\\'t.\\n\\nWhat these people did is they went to VerizonWireless.com and entered my phone number into the username/password login form. You can login with your number on vzw. So they put in my number and click forgot password, which resets your password and texts you a new one. If I had given that number that was texted to me to this woman she would have then been able to reset my account password to whatever she wanted and I wouldn\\'t have been able to get back into my account. She could have ordered herself whatever she wanted from within my account. So please beware, if someone calls you from a company and says there is fraud hang up on them immediately and call the company from a number on their website. It will cost you only about 30 seconds and save you a ton of trouble!', 'comments': ['Never give ANY sensitive information to anyone who calls you.  ONLY give sensitive information to somebody who you called.\\n\\nOnly agree to call somebody at an official phone number listed on an official website.  Alternatively, insist that you call an official number on an official website and that you be transferred to someone.\\n\\nDon\\'t ever give any kind of \"password or other security or verification code\" to anyone under any circumstance.\\n\\nIf you can do those things successfully, you harden yourself by like 1000x to a lot of scams.', 'Just to share hopefully will save someone: I work in  fraud  for a major bank, we are dealing with an almost identical issue except they are spoofing our **FRAUD DEPARTMENTS** phone number and when they call you they will be on the phone with our fraud department at the same time and when you give them your temp password that is actually sent from our department to you they will just repeat what you told them. The best thing you can do EVER is if you get a call from your banks fraud department just hangup wether you think it is legit or not and just call the number on the back of your card or first googled number for the bank you see and they will help you. We will hardly ever call you, so if your bank calls you just to be safe hang up and call back.', 'My mom fell for this scam a few months ago.

There are no red flags in the Reddit search results that suggest the site in question is a fraudulent operation. Given the information I have gathered through the WHOIS record, certificate information, and the lack of negative social media mentions specifically related to Spritz Finance being a scam, there is no substantive evidence to classify https://www.spritz.finance/ as a fraudulent site.
