        "thought": "The Reddit search results show that there are referral codes being shared, which is common for many legitimate services, as well as discussions regarding the company's dealings with ASIC and the nature of its crypto products. The referral codes alone are not indicative of a scam, as many companies have referral programs. Additionally, the discussion about ASIC's court judgment appears to be about the legal status of Block Earner's crypto products and does not necessarily indicate a scam. However, the legal scrutiny could be a concern for some users. Given the information I have gathered so far, I do not see definitive evidence that https://blockearner.com.au/ is a scam website. It appears to be a legitimate business offering crypto-related services and has been involved in legal discussions regarding the status of its products. It is registered with AUSTRAC as a Digital Currency Exchange and Independent Remittance Provider, which adds to its legitimacy. The presence of referral codes and discussions on Reddit do not inherently indicate a scam. However, consumers should always exercise caution and conduct their own due diligence before engaging with any financial service. I now know the final answer. Based on the analysis conducted using the tools provided and the observations made, there is no conclusive evidence to classify https://blockearner.com.au/ as a scam website. It is a registered business with a digital presence, and there are no clear signs of the scam characteristics listed.",
