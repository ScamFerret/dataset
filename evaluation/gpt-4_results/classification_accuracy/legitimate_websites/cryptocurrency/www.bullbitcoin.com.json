Reviews Hear from our customers The most trusted way to buy bitcoin by far. They make it incredibly easy - my wire transfer was accepted right away and the whole transaction was effortless. I know these guys personally and transparency is key. Would recommend. Ruz du Plooy I was extremely satisfied with Bull Bitcoin. I sold Bitcoins on a Sunday and I had the money in my personal checking account on Monday morning! Also, another time I had a major security issue (unrelated to Bull Bitcoin) as I had lost basically my wallet access on another app and was truly in panic mode and they called me on a Friday evening to give me some tips on what to do and with their help I was able to import my wallet on the same evening, relieving a great stress. Their messaging system is also very responsive, you normally get an answer very quickly. These guys are number one for a reason! Jeremie Martin I bought a support package with a coldcard from Bull Bitcoin. It was a great experience. During the support call I learned a lot about self custody. I’m very grateful for the knowledge, thank you! JB J Braun Great customer service! The team was truely helpful, I felt I could ask them anything and they always had the answer. Will do business with them again for sure! Antoine Deslauriers I have been using Bull Bitcoin (and Bylls.com, their other site) for years, and sending/receiving Canadian dollars when buying/selling Bitcoin has always worked quickly and reliably. Odi Kosmatos Great for buying Bitcoin and sending it to your own self-hosted wallet. You can easily set up a recurring buy to dollar cost average (DOA) or buy whenever you like. I used the Bylls service to pay my internet bill and it worked perfectly. Bull Bitcoin doesn't bother with alt-coins or the latest token du jour. Just the good stuff David Ellis I have been using BullBitcoin for several years. User support is fast and efficient. You can also pay anything with Bylls. You can also DCA on different addresses. Definitely the best Canadian service (if not worldwide). Sebastien Ruel This exchange does not hold your private keys (Not your keys, not your Bitcoin), nor do they sell any altcoins (tired of seeing people get rekt. This aligns with my values toward this industry. RW Robert Weaver They are amazing the customer service is fast they took the time to explain me everything to set my account and all the prosses whit my bank account has a French Canadian i really appreciate their French service. For all that I only do my transaction with bullbitcoin and bylls JF Jean-Francois Bullbitcoin is literally saving the lives of Canadians. By far the best platform for purchasing bitcoin, likely anywhere in the world, but the fact their owners ensure they are always bitcoin-only puts them in a league of their own. This is a legendary company run by legendary humans. There’s nothing more to be said. Buy bitcoin.

        "thought": "The text extracted from the website does not show any unusually low prices or claims of free giveaways that are typical of many fraudulent sites. The company, Bull Bitcoin, seems to focus on Bitcoin-related services and presents itself as a Bitcoin-only exchange and payments service. They also emphasize a non-custodial approach, which is a legitimate practice in the cryptocurrency space. Additionally, they mention a history since 2013 and a founder who is recognized in the Bitcoin community. They have customer reviews and a section warning against fraudsters imitating their brand, which is a good sign of their awareness and proactive approach to security. However, more information is needed to make a definitive judgment.",
