Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/chicago) if you have any questions or concerns.*', 'TL;DR: Scam. I had to report them to the state for fraudulently charging my insurance for a cleaning they did not do. \\xa0\\n\\nLonger explanation: I was way overdue for a cleaning and they had immediate availability (first warning sign) where my regular dentist it was going to be about a month. As I sat in the chair, I could hear two hygienists discussing a “successful upsell” with the front desk (second warning sign). They took X-rays, used this weird wand to take photos of my teeth, and claimed I needed thousands of dollars of dental work. No cleaning was done on our first visit, despite this being the explicit reason for my visit. The front desk pushed hard to make a second appointment, but I demurred and said I wanted to sleep on it. They emailed 2 days later to try and set up the appointments for the half dozen procedures and let me know the insurance would cover half. It was almost the exact annual limit of my dental plan (third warning sign).\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0I was instantly suspicious because while I was about 6 months behind on a cleaning, the last time I’d seen my regular dentist I had one crown due for replacing but otherwise good oral health. Went to my regular dentist month later and they disagreed with every treatment recommended to me except the mouthguard. My regular dentist also told me they’d filed a claim against my insurance for a cleaning and my insurance only covered two for the year so I would have to pay for my next one out of pocket (giant red flag conga line at this point).\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nI explained they had done no such cleaning. My dentist advised me to try and resolve it amicably and escalate to the state insurance commission if they wouldn’t. Tried twice to get them to remove it, even let them know my third try would be through the state. No dice, the state was able to help me get it taken off finally.\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\nIt was such a hassle, I can’t in reasonable conscience not share my story and \\xa0warn others away. The dentist is scary enough for most people without worrying they’re taking advantage of you.', \"I said it before, but it is a Dentist LARPing as a techbro, trying to sell you every bit of nonsense that you may not need. \\n\\nI have a local independent I've been going to for 30 years who I trust. I have no interest in Tom Haverford attempting dental care.\", 'I went to Dentologie for two years every 6 months. The first few appts they told me they were watching one cavity spot - it was the same spot my prior dentist had been watching so I was happy with their decisions. The 4th time I went, I saw a different dentist who told me I had 8 cavities - 6 of them needed to be filled. I asked multiple times how it could be possible given that I had been seen 6 months prior and everything was fine. They really couldn’t provide an answer beyond “maybe you’re drinking more coffee”. It seemed weird so I scheduled an appt with my childhood dentist that was an hour away for a second opinion. My childhood dentist gave me a long speech prior to the appt about how there are different schools of thought in dentistry and while some dentists might fill something sooner, another dentist might just watch it. They asked that I not tell them which teeth needed to be filled until they did their own exam. During my exam, they were so concerned with how they weren’t seeing cavities that they asked if they could do another set of X-rays, even though they might not be covered by insurance since I got them done the week before. Dentologie had sent over their images using some unique fancy software that made them blurry for my childhood dentist to view. They still only saw the one spot we had been watching for several years on the new X-rays. When I read off the teeth that Dentologie wanted to fill, my dentist was totally shocked. I’ve never gone back to Dentologie after that. Many reviews for the south loop location share the same experience as my own.', 'A good dentist is hard to find, but definitely go with someone who your friends or colleagues would recommend instead of convenience of location. These are popping up like Mattress Firms everywhere. A decade ago, I went to a dentist scammer (I should have known that I should not select a dentist based on whether they have a Groupon, but I was young and naive!) and they recommended all sorts of treatment. He said he could fill or put crowns on like eight teeth in four hours. Thank goodness I got a second opinion because that extensive treatment was not at all warranted and who knows what damage could have been done by someone who doesn’t know what they are doing. With that short time estimate, you know it is not going to be work with a good attention to detail. 😬']}, {'title': 'Teenager in the SUV thought a solid green light and arrow turning left are the same thing.

I was headed to Nova Gold Imports but stopped at Land of Jewelry on the way. They showed me 14k solid white gold franco chain (3mm, 22 inches). \\n\\nI thought it'd be $1.3-1.6k after looking at Jacoje and Saints Gold's websites. But they said it would $950 so I asked for the weight and they said 18 grams. I let my excitement get the best of me and paid for it. \\n\\nWhen I got home though, the grams vs price started to bother me. I checked Jacoje's site again and it showed the same chain was about 29.1 grams. On Saints Gold, it showed 28.8 grams. \\n\\nThat's like a 10 gram difference!! Now I'm wondering if I was scammed?? This was my first chain purchase ever, so I have no clue. Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated.\", 'comments': [\"What exactly do you mean by scammed? I can't tell you if the gold is real or not, but the math isn't unrealistic as far as cost per gram. Jacoje has a 3mm 22-inch plain Franco at 29.1 grams for $1660, which works out to about $57 a gram. You said yours was only 18 grams and was $950, which puts yours at right under $53 a gram. Based on the spot price, you're at around a 45% markup, and Jacoje is around 57% markup. Both are reasonable. If the gold is real, I'd say it's a good deal for new jewelry.\", \"I suppose it could be hollow. I'm not an expert by any means, so I didn't realize that the franco style could be done hollow. \\n\\nI will say, if you end up returning the chain and need to look elsewhere, I just went to Jacoje, and I'm very happy with the franco I received from them. Shipping was fast as well, so you could receive it by your deadline.\", 'It doesn’t sound like you got scammed. It could be that they didn’t have the width you were looking for so they gave you a slightly thinner one. It could also be the manufacturer. Different manufacturers have different specs. Looking at your picture, the ends where the chain meets the clasp is different than the ones Jacoje sells. It could be a manufacturer thing but doesn’t sound like you got scammed. I’ve shopped at Nova and they would’ve given you a slightly better price though. Don’t be afraid to ask what is the price per gram and if they can give you a lower price. If they don’t, move onto the next one.', 'That’s the dog tag chain to a gi Joe figure', '$53 a gram is a great price']}]"

I have now completed several actions, including checking the website content, WHOIS information, SSL certificates, and searching for reviews and scam reports on social media and review sites. Based on the observations, there are mixed signals. The website content has some elements that could potentially indicate a scam, such as unusually generous offers and promotions, while WHOIS information shows that the domain has been registered for a while and with privacy protection. The SSL certificates are valid and from reputable issuers. The reviews are mixed, with some suggesting legitimacy and others warning of a scam. I now know the final answer. The analysis has provided mixed signals. While some aspects of the website raise concerns, such as very generous offers and promotions which could target psychological weaknesses, and the private registration of the domain, there is also evidence of legitimacy, such as a longer domain registration period and valid SSL certificates. Additionally, mixed reviews make it hard to conclusively label the site as a scam without further evidence. Therefore, based on the information available, I cannot conclusively determine if \"Solid ECN\" is a scam website.",
