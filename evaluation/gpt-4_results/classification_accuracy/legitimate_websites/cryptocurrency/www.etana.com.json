Basically, a lot of people during the last 10 days said that slowly all banks in my country decline the transactions and some even CANCEL accounts of people who try to deposit/cash out 1000-2000 EUR from crypto. Recently, I start to hear that Revolut makes it harder to deposit/cash out Bitcoin/crypto money too.\\n\\n**My parameters:**\\n\\n\\\\- *Location*: Based in country within the European Union\\n\\n\\\\- *Money*: Got 2000 EUR in my current \"shit\" bank (which blocks paying to/from) Bitcoin/crypto, want to migrate to a better one and invest all my money into crypto.\\n\\n**My wants:**\\n\\n\\\\- (**MUST**) An all online bank (preferably in EU), which does not bullshit and ask you \"Do you got that money from Bitcoin or what?\" and threaten to cancel your account for trading crypto\\n\\n\\\\- **(MUST) Provide you with an EUR IBAN account in which you can transfer money from/to another banks. Must be able to pay to crypto markets!**\\n\\n\\\\- (**MUST**) Allow registering an account for all citizens of EU (I am EU citizen)\\n\\n\\\\- (**MUST**) NO monthly fee for the account. Transaction fees are OK (they have to eat, right?)\\n\\n\\\\- (**Optional**) Possibility to pay directly from/to IBAN to the coin market via SEPA (Credit cards have higher fees)\\n\\n\\\\- (**Optional**) Some credible reputation of the bank itself. (I regret so much for not being a Belgian citizen, their Keytrade bank PAYS YOU on each transaction and you can deposit right into your iDEAL account, but requires Belgian ID). Swiss banks are also gangsta, but they often require you to be German/Swiss citizen and \"insane\" minimum deposits (15,000+ CHF).\\n\\n\\\\- **(Optional)** Some \"shady startup bank\" type is also good which is still \"climbing up the ladder\" and offering attractive no/fees and low regulation (imagine Revolut in its early days). I\\'m totally OK risking 2000 EUR with such a bank, instead of bothering with the bullshit corporates.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Some notes of my current personal \"research\" and \"experiences\" (might be helpful):**\\n\\n|*Provider*|*Fees*|*Friendly to crypto?*|*Do they provide EUR account with IBAN?*|*Application*|*Notes*|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|🤔🇬🇧 **Revolut**|Lots of people complain about their fees|Not anymore. **Binance officially not supported.**|Yes|💩🤖 Does not support Android 5.0.

That way your bank account sends funds to Etana account and then Etana will send the funds to Kraken. With that option you don’t have any problem with your bank because you do not send funds to crypto exchange directly, but to Etana which is a custody service and not an exchange. Etana has flat deposit and withdrawal fees of $35 USD or foreign equivalent, and if you’re a Kraken client, that deposit fee is always waived. There are never fees transferring funds between your Etana account and the exchanges.\"*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Local Swiss / Belgian / Dutch / Luxembourgish / etc. banks open to all EU members:** Surprisingly, some local banks do allow members of other EU countries to register in them (say bank is in France, you are from Czech => you register via ID verification).

        "thought": "The search on Reddit found a post titled \"Etana SCAM!!!\" in the KrakenSupport subreddit, where a user complains about a withdrawal issue, stating that a month has passed and they have not received their money. Another post titled \"Etana Is a huge scam\" also in the KrakenSupport subreddit, the user complains about the verification process, potential misuse of passport details, and issues with transferring funds. While these complaints are concerning, it is not uncommon for legitimate financial services to have customer complaints, especially in the cryptocurrency space, which can have complex issues with banking and transfers. It is important to consider whether these complaints represent systemic issues or isolated incidents.
