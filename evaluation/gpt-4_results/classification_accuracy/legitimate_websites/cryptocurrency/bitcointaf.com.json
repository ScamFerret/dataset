        "thought": "The website offers a variety of cryptocurrency training and trading tools, and it seems to target different skill levels. There are claims of being trusted by thousands of members globally and having been around since 2016. The pricing for some services is available, such as $199 for a 30-day trial, which is not unusually low. It does, however, mention the use of a coupon for a free 7-day option, which could be a tactic to attract users. Given the information about the products and services, and the claims of being an industry leader, I should verify the legitimacy of the company and its claims.

The website claims to have been around since 2016, but the domain registration date of 2020 contradicts this claim, which could be a potential red flag.

It's worth noting that the reviews are on a reputable third-party website, which lends some credibility to the feedback.

However, the discrepancy between the domain registration and the claimed start date of the business and the lack of substantial independent feedback still warrants caution.
