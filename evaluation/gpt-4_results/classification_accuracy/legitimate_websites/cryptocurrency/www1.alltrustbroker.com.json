However, the lack of information and the fact that it's a newly registered domain could be potential red flags. It's still possible that it could become a scam in the future once the site is developed, especially considering the domain name implies financial services, which are often targeted by scammers. Since the website content is not fully developed and there are no user reports or discussions found about this website on social media, there is not enough evidence to conclusively determine if it is a scam. However, the newness of the domain and the lack of information are concerning and should be monitored. I now know the final answer.
