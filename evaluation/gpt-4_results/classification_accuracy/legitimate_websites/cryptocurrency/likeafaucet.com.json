There are claims of earning free cryptocurrency, unusually high returns on investment (120% return), and an emphasis on quick and easy signup to start earning. It also mentions lotteries and payouts which could target human psychological weaknesses. Furthermore, the website claims to support a large number of cryptocurrencies, which is uncommon for a legitimate e-commerce website. The mention of \"coins\" and \"Faucet Tokens\" as a mode of earning might indicate unusual payment methods.
