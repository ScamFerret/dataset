Yes maybe for some very specific manifestations that might be the case like becoming a master chef but to say someone has to work themselves to the bone to manifest money is plain silly and the opposite of what Neville Goddard said. If you look at the world a lot of the people that make tons of money don\\'t even work hard. Most of them got their wealth quite easily. Even if they did work for it they did work they enjoyed. I know people who have manifested money out of thin air. Not literally but they would get a bunch of money from some inheritance or win a sweepstakes or something. They didn\\'t have to work hard for it. They simply imagined getting a bunch of money and it happened. \\n\\nI get tired of these people saying \"I worked hard and manifested a corporate job and now make 300k a year. You can manifest it too.\" Look I don\\'t want a corporate job and not everyone does. If you\\'re happy and content with your corporate job that pays well that\\'s awesome I\\'m truly and honestly happy for you. Other people say \"Well you have to have purpose.\" Yes we need to have a purpose but not everyone\\'s purpose is to work in an office or at any regular job. I\\'ve searched high and low for a job I can enjoy and I simply cannot find one. I simply don\\'t resonate with working whatsoever. Being subservient to a boss does not interest me. I know some will reply and say \"well just start your own business.\" That doesn\\'t resonate with me either. Owning and running a business would be just as stressful if not more so than being an employee. \"Oh but you can invest in crypto. I made a bunch in crypto.\" Well not everyone has money to invest in crypto and some people don\\'t want to wait ten years for it to get anywhere. Life is very short and I\\'d rather get easy money and enjoy life. I have absolutely zero desire to work any job whatsoever and other people feel the same way. These \"coaches\" need to stop saying that their is something wrong with us. Some of us want to manifest a bunch of money and live a life of ease. This is what we desire and what we shall manifest. Hard work works for some but it\\'s not for everyone.', 'comments': ['People say you gotta have a purpose coz otherwise you’d just be bored like a salted fish. \\n\\nYou wake up, have some fun, or do nothing, and go back to bed.

I like to have a flexible schedule and learn things at my own pace. \\n\\nI’m not trying to be a hustler and I’m not competing with anyone. \\n\\nOf course I’m not going to create a life that makes me suffer and shout to the world, “look at me! I’ve endured all this suffering and overcome it! I’m so successful, you can too!“ \\n\\nWhy? I’ve never understood it. Why can’t I be mediocre, AND then go on to create the best life possible? \\n\\nWhy do I have to suffer and be proud of it? Yeah I mean everyone’s been through some shit. Doesn’t mean you gotta keep going through that shit to be great. \\n\\nBe great now. Shift states now. Why not? Let’s all uplift each other and be the greatness we want to see. Make yourself proud and tell Neville in your imagination that you’ve made it. He will smile and shake your hand while saying congratulations.\\n\\nRemember the lady who felt, “isn’t it wonderful?” as she fell asleep every night and she got a fortune from an old friend. Wasn’t that natural? She didn’t even expect it, but it was natural for her. \\n\\nIt will be natural for you too, and you don’t have to expect it.

People win the lotto all the time, people end up w a windfall of money from family, or end up finding that they’re sitting on a goldmine of rare old coins they found as a kid. Like there’s INFINITE ways to make money. \\n\\nSo I agree w you. I don’t wanna work much either', 'Agreed LOL.

This indicates that the site is likely secure from an encryption standpoint, which is a good sign, but it does not necessarily vouch for the legitimacy of the business itself. To get a better understanding of the company's reputation and the experiences of its clients, it would be beneficial to search for any discussions or mentions on popular social media platforms.",

        "thought": "Unfortunately, I cannot perform the SearchX/Twitter action as no observation result was returned. It seems that there may be a limitation in the tools or an error occurred. I need to use another approach to gather information about the website's legitimacy and reputation. Given the limitations of the tools and the information I have gathered so far, I should now assess whether the website has any characteristics typical of a scam site based on the content and information available. Based on the text extracted from the website, there are some claims that could potentially be red flags, such as the mention of being the only registered cryptocurrency expert on the London Chamber of Commerce Experts Panel, which I could not verify due to tool limitations. There is also a promotion of membership for less than £5.00 per week with a 100% money-back guarantee, which could be perceived as targeting human psychological weaknesses. The contact information provided on the site seems to be appropriate for business use, and the privacy policy and terms and conditions were mentioned, but their clarity was not assessed. The payment methods were not directly observed, and the site does display some characteristics of an e-commerce website, as it offers memberships and guides. There is no clear evidence of handling different products from common e-commerce websites or the presence of unusually low prices and claims of free, aside from the membership offer which is not necessarily unusual. Based on the current observations, there is insufficient evidence to definitively classify 'yourcryptocoach.co.uk' as a scam website. However, the lack of external validation and the inability to verify some of the claims made on the website do raise concerns that would warrant caution. I now know the final answer. Based on the available evidence and the analysis performed, there is not enough information to conclusively determine that 'yourcryptocoach.co.uk' is a scam website. However, there are concerns that warrant caution due to unverifiable claims and the targeting of psychological weaknesses through membership offers.",
