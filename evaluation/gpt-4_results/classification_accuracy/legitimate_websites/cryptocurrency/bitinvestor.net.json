This rarely takes more than 30 minutes. After that, it depends on how quickly your bank receives bank transfers, typically within 1 business day. How do I complete identity verification? In order to complete identity verification, have your passport or driver’s license ready as well as a device with your camera. Then begin your verification, take an image of your passport or driver’s license and take a live selfie of your face. Once done, you will have to wait for the system to verify your identity. This usually takes 5-10 minutes. If you have to verify your address, we need a document that is no older than 3 months old. This can be a bank statement, rent agreement, water bill, utility bill, etc. If you experience problems or have any questions about the process, please message us in our livechat What price will I buy/sell for? The prices that you see on the buy and sell page are the current prices which you would get if we received your payment/cryptocurrency right now. As soon as we receive your payment/cryptocurrency, the price gets locked in. When buying, the price is instantly locked in with Credit Card, Apple Pay and Google Pay. With bank transfer, the price is locked in as soon as we receive your bank transfer. When selling, the price is locked in after your transaction has 1 confirmation on the blockchain. That usually never takes more than 30 minutes. Where do I find my cryptocurrency \"address\"? Check out our instructions here How is cryptocurrency taxed?

The website claims to be regulated by various financial authorities, which is a good sign, but this needs to be verified. The prices of cryptocurrencies are also listed, but without a market comparison, it's hard to tell if these are unusually low. The site does mention a range of common payment methods, which is typically a good sign, but the promise of low fees and quick transactions could appeal to human psychological weaknesses for quick gains.
