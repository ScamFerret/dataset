There are reviews on various sites including Trustpilot, and while there is mention that it is not regulated by any government or non-government body, this is not uncommon for crypto-based platforms. The reviews do not explicitly label the site as a scam, and there seems to be content suggesting that it operates like a normal broker with access to trading platforms. Given the information from the WHOIS data, valid SSL certificates, the nature of the business (crypto-based online brokerage), and the absence of any immediate red flags from the search results, I am inclined to say that there are no signs pointing to this being a scam website based on the characteristics provided.
