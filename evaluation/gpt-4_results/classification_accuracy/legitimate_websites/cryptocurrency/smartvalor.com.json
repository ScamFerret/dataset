We have an open marriage. I am ethically non monogamous. No, I did not use joint funds; I used my personal credit cards.*** \\n\\nIt\\'s super embarrassing to be posting here. I have a lot of anxiety about what I endured and am still enduring because of this scam. I thought I was smart enough not to fall for the b/s. Turns out, I wasn\\'t.\\n\\nThis is a long-con \\\\~ I know this now. It began in January of this year via Instagram. I was feeling ignored, unappreciated, and unloved in my marriage. I was ripe for the scam pickings. I thought this person cared about me. He told me he was stationed in El Paso with the Army in Special Forces. He had the Insta pics to \\'prove\\' it. Then, he went on deployment overseas. This is when the con started. I was skeptical at first...what person asks you for money for their sick child? To pay their older child\\'s rent? To purchase safety equipment for a mission they\\'re on? He laid it on thick. \"Don\\'t you care about my safety?\" Over six months, I gave him well over $8,000 via Paypal. Always to different email addresses. Always through friends and family so I paid the fee, not whoever was receiving the money. I started to wise up when I ran out of money to give him and he would berate me, saying he knew I had the money to send but was just choosing not to. How he loved me and I was treating him like sh!t. I tried breaking it off more than once. He just kept sucking me back in with sob stories. I never sent him anymore money though. I did ask to be paid back several times with a bank certified check drawn off of his bank. Again, I thought this dude was real. Hindsight is 20/20. We spoke on the phone several times...he had a thick African sounding accent. We videochatted twice. Once, the quality was horrible. The second time, I could tell it was a still picture being manipulated by computer to appear like the person was talking.\\n\\nA few weeks ago, he told me he was sending me a check to pay me back. I thought, \\'hell yes!\\' He asked me for my bank information (nope) and my physical address (also nope). However, as I still thought this was kinda legit, I gave him another physical address. He sent the check. It was postmarked from one state, the check was drawn off a company in another state. Immediately, alarm bells rang. I called my bank and told them the cliff notes version. They said, under no circumstances should I deposit the check, that it was a scam. So, I didn\\'t. I filed a report with IC3. I compiled as much information against this person as I could and stored it and the check in my safe at home.\\n\\nFast forward to yesterday...he began threatening me with releasing private photos/videos of me to my family, friends, and workplace if I didn\\'t give him his money. He swears up and down that I cashed the check but just was holding onto all of it. I engaged with him a few times...and after speaking with my husband (who has known about this almost from the beginning), I blocked him on Insta, gmail, and google chat. Gmail blocks are stupid because it just sends the blocked emails to spam. Where I can still read them. I wanted to keep ahead of any physical threats of harm so I kept reading them. I realized, however, that it was f\\\\*king with me mentally. So, I set a rule to where his emails get deleted instead.\\n\\nI found this forum last night. The fear is real but it isn\\'t enough to get me to continue doing his bidding. After his threats and constant harassment, I filed a report with the FBI. I want this check, which is probably stolen or at the very least, the funds are stolen, out of my possession. I\\'m thinking of making a trip to the FBI office locally.\\n\\nI know that his threats are empty. I know he\\'s just trying to get money from me. But the fear and anxiety is there still. I\\'ve warned my friends and family about him, provided them his insta handle and told them to block and report. I\\'ve reported the account to Insta for harassment.\\n\\nI don\\'t technically need advice. I just wanted to warn others. No matter how lonely you are or how unloved you feel...don\\'t fall for this sh!t like I did.\\n\\nThanks for allowing me the space to vent.', 'comments': ['A reminder of the rules in r/scams.
