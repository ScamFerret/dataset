Investing in crypto can be generally easy for anyone with access to a phone or computer. Currently, there are around 240 stocks on the NYSE, and around 2500 on the NASDAQ. It is hard enough to pick the best of that bunch for stocks. When you discover there are over 30 000 cryptocurrency projects, with over 90% of them being rubbish, finding a winner can be harder than finding a needle in a haystack. Leveraging your time by outsourcing to an expert is why 80-90% of investors use professional fund managers and mutual funds. Can my (SMSF, 401K, XYZ structure) invest in crypto? Both individuals and legal structures can invest in cryptocurrency. This includes companies, trusts, self-managed superannuation funds, retirement, and pension funds. If you have any questions, please ask! What types of cryptos are there? There are thousands of different types of cryptos, just as there are thousands of different types of companies and stocks. To discover what we are investing in, you can refer to the Portfolio Monthly Updates What is the difference between a crypto exchange and a crypto wallet? A crypto exchange is like a stock exchange, where you buy or sell cryptocurrency. A crypto wallet is where you store your cryptocurrency after you have purchased it. Leaving crypto on an exchange is not wise as exchanges are not 100% secure. Crypto wallets can be referred to as “hot” (connected to the internet) or “cold” (not connected to the internet). A cold wallet is the most secure storage. What are the potential returns of investing in crypto? Without crystal balls, we cannot see what will happen in the future; however, in the past, our research methodology has uncovered huge opportunities. In the first four years, the Bostoncoin fund returned over 366%, with gains of over 10 000% on no less than six coins in the portfolio. It is essential to know that “past performance is not an indicator of future returns” and that nothing is guaranteed. Why is Bostoncoin called the “coin of coins”? Investors can invest on their own, in any of the tens of thousands of available cryptocurrencies. Investing in the Bostoncoin or DARTcoin diversified crypto mutual fund means that you are investing in dozens of different cryptocurrencies or coins in one package. Should I follow the advice of my friend/TikTok/YouTube? Most talking heads on Youtube or TikTok are paid by advertisers, the owners of the coin they are promoting, or just by increased views. So-called “finfluencers” are not necessarily operating in your best interest, and many may be operating illegally. We find it is best to allow the experts to be the experts, so unless your friend is a professional hedge fund manager, don’t listen. So many crypto scams are around; how do I stay safe? If you or a friend have lost money in a bad crypto project, don’t panic. Researchers at CoinTelegraph stated that “up to 92% of crypto projects are scams”. Some very famous people have fallen for the scams, and some very clever people have lost millions of dollars. We are happy to report that, out of thousands of projects we have invested in, since Jan 2016, we have not had one coin go to zero. This is largely due to using the four-step “ COIN protocol Why choose Bostoncoin over the competitors? There are thousands of stock mutual funds worldwide, and only a handful of crypto mutual funds. As nobody can predict the future, we cannot claim which fund will be the best performer next year. We can tell you that the Bostoncoin fund was the world’s first crypto mutual fund (since January 2016) and the first crypto fund to be listed on the global investment powerhouse MorningStar. The competitors have not been around for so long, with some under one year old. If the fund manager cannot show you a five-year chart, perhaps avoid them. What is the minimum investment amount? The minimum initial investment for all Boston Trading Co funds is $10 000. The minimum additional investment is $1000. You can make regular investments monthly or on an ad hoc basis. Many other crypto mutual funds have minimum investment amounts of $50 000 up to $250 000, making them out of the reach of many investors. There are no lock-in periods. You can access your funds at any time. However, as with most speculative investments, the suggested timeframe is five to seven years to maximise growth on your investment.

On Friday night, I had a guildie reach out to me offering to craft the Lionheart Helm for me. I mentioned in guild chat I was 6 Arcanite short. He offered to front me the arcanite and I could pay him back. \\n\\nWe go to the Anvil in IF, he takes my mats : 80 thorium, 40 wicked claws, 10 blue sapphires, 4 Azerothian diamonds, and 6 Arcanite bars (again he was covering the last bit, and I was going to pay him back). All and all about 700 gold worth of materials. (He tried to get me to pay for the mats up front but backed off when I said I was just going to farm the last crystals and I was ok with waiting)\\n\\nAfter he got the materials from me, he logged off. 20 minutes go by, and I start to freak out. I reached out to other guildies who knew him better. After some digging we found he left discord, and the server discord (Bigglesworth). He transferred servers with my mats and sold them (so I hear). \\n\\nThis has set me back tremendously, but the important part here isn\\'t about me. It\\'s about the follow up from Blizzard.\\n\\nI opened multiple tickets, and received canned responses back to back. I escalated and asked for a head GM and got another response saying that they would not be able to restore my items because \"this took place in Classic\" and \"is considered unsupported by [their] teams\". Trading/Professions are a huge part of the game and some recipes are incredibly rare so you MUST find someone you can trade to make this happen. I can\\'t believe this is the stance they\\'re taking, but there\\'s not much I can do at this point.\\nI\\'m a level 59 Warrior. This is my BiS helmet. I had to chose between helmet and mount. I chose helmet and got burnt. This is a tremendous set back. Do not let this happen to you. \\n\\nI know there were some red flags I probably missed, and I could\\'ve handled this better, but when it\\'s a geared out guildie you assume you can trust them more than the average crafter. This was also early in the morning so no one was on to verify. \\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/BRFY2zY\\n\\nTL;dr If you trade someone trust them. Blizzard won\\'t help you if they run off with your materials.  Don\\'t let this happen to you.\\n\\nEdit: This occurred on 11/23/19 around 1:20 AM Server to 2:00 AM (server)\\nEdit2: Response from Blizzard CS forums : https://imgur.com/gallery/QsWPzyM\\n\\nUPDATE: They issued me a warning for getting my items stolen when I opened another ticket.  https://imgur.com/gallery/iLQgQA0', 'comments': [\"I'm sorry you were scammed.\\n\\nWhile reading this post I tried to come up with some ideas for safeguards to protect people in your situation.\\n\\nOf course hindsight is 20/20, but I think the best way to avoid this scam is to sell the mats to the crafter, then buy the crafted item from them.

        "thought": "The Reddit search did not yield any relevant results specifically related to Boston Trading Co being a scam. Most of the results are unrelated to the company in question. At this point, I've gathered information about the company's website content, WHOIS data, Trustpilot reviews, and public presence of a key individual associated with the company. However, I have not found any concrete evidence that would categorically prove the website is a scam. Given the information available, I need to make an informed decision based on the characteristics of a scam website as provided, the credibility of the reviews and information found, and the absence of any reports of it being a scam. Based on the characteristics of scam websites provided at the beginning, the website does boast high returns and significant investment claims, which can be a red flag. However, there is no clear evidence of unusually low prices, non-existent companies, inappropriate contact details, ambiguous privacy policies, uncommon payment methods, or outdated information. The presence of Trustpilot reviews and a public figure associated with the company lends some credibility, although the WHOIS information is hidden by privacy protection. Without more concrete evidence of a scam, I must conclude that there is not enough information to definitively label the website as a scam site. I now know the final answer. Based on the information available and the actions taken, there is not enough conclusive evidence to determine that the website https://bostontrading.co/ is a scam website.",
