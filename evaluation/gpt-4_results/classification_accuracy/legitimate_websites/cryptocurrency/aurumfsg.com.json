However, I want to provide more options for our users including options for users not in the USA.\\n\\nThis is where you guys come in. I want to hear your thoughts on the best crypto tax software options available. Which software have you used, and what did you like or dislike about it? Did it make tax reporting easier or more difficult? Any tips or advice for others who are looking for a good crypto tax software option?\\n\\nAdditionally, if you've worked with a CPA/tax preparer who is knowledgeable in crypto that you'd recommend, please share their name, country, and any information you have about your experience with them.

To explain what we mean by that, I'd encourage you to try margin trading or dual investment on Binance (which might not be available for US residents) or on Kraken. Then track the same on Descrypt and other tools. We cover all sub-wallets within all the exchanges that we support which is something our current user base absolutely loves. \\n\\nWe also have support on-chain for 7 chains currently and are adding more options soon. Taxation is a function of accuracy in transaction fetches; we've also covered that E2E.
