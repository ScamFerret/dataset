This may be done for a valid reason as spammers use this information to email website owners. Unfortunately is also makes identification of the owner difficult. We prefer if the website does show his true identity. Webshop Review The Tranco ranking of this website is low. This can be considered low in relation to other websites from the website's country. If you think this website should be very popular, please invest additional time in researching the company as this is suspicious. For a smaller or starting website a low ranking can be considered normal. How to check if a cryptocurrency site is legit or a scam. Technical Review We have identified payment methods on this website which allow the company to remain anonymous. These payment methods usually also offer anonymity for the buyer. The disadvantage of these kinds of payment methods is that it is often very difficult or even impossible to get your money back if the merchant does not deliver the product or service. If possible, we advise consumers to use payment methods with some level of \"money-back\" guarantee such as the major credit card companies and Paypal.

It also mentions payment methods that support anonymous transactions, which could be a concern. However, there are no consumer reviews available on Scamadviser to verify the legitimacy of the site. The presence of a valid SSL certificate is a positive sign, but not conclusive evidence of legitimacy. While there are some red flags highlighted by Scamadviser, there is no concrete evidence of a scam from the reviews or scam advisory check. The website seems to be professionally laid out, with detailed information about an event, speakers, and sponsors. No glaring scam characteristics are present, such as unusually low prices, claims of guaranteed money, or targeting psychological weaknesses. Final I now know the final answer.
