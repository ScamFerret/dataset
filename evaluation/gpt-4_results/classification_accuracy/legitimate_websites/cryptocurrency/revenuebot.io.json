Detailed Features Smart Grid of Orders A grid of orders, which the bot places on the exchange, is used for trading. Volume of Orders The volume of orders in a grid is determined by the Martingale system. The first order in the grid is the smallest in volume and the closest to the current exchange price. Each subsequent order in the grid is larger in volume than the previous one and farther from the current exchange price. In addition, the volume of orders in the grid can be adjusted manually by specifying the percentage of the total deposit allocated to the crypto trading bot. Grid of Order Prices Order prices in the grid are distributed according to the percentage of price change overlap specified in the crypto trading bot settings. The distribution of prices can be linear or logarithmic. In the linear distribution, the order prices are at the same distance from each other throughout the price change overlap. The logarithmic price distribution sets a higher density of orders at the current price on the exchange, in order to involve more of the deposit in the trade at low volatility. Notifications and Bot Operation Reports Stay tuned for the main crypto bot operation events. Set your notifications and stay in touch with the conducted transactions and the profits you have made by trading with bots. Review detailed reports on your crypto trading bot performance: conducted transactions and gained profits daily, weekly or monthly. Notifications are available through SMS, E-mail, Telegram, and the Web. Volatility Indicators and Trading Signals It’s important to choose the right trading pairs with good volatility to gain more trading revenue with RevenueBot. For this purpose, the crypto bot evaluates volatility indicators and trading signals (RSI, CCI, Bollinger Bands) in every trading pair present on the exchange. Bot Operation Simulation (backtests) Examine the bot’s last 60 days of operation simulation in any of the trading pairs to choose the best operation settings. Try different settings and the automated trading bot will show how it would have traded in a period of time set in the past, with real price volatility schemes and with a virtual deposit. This will help determine the best robot operation settings for an exact crypto trading pair. Cryptocurrency Futures Trading with Leverage Using leverage allows you to open large positions with minimal investment. You can use leverage up to x125 for some trading pairs. Saving Various Bot Operation Settings Presets Have you picked the optimal bot operation settings? Save it as a preset and use it with the other crypto currency trading bots. Have you picked the optimal volatility analyzer settings? Save it also as a preset to automatically switch between the trading pairs. In addition, you can create general lists of coins, save them and use these lists in different bots for crypto trading. TradingView Signals You can use TradingView signals as a starting condition of the auto trading bot. The TradingView platform is extremely popular with traders due to its ease of use, data accuracy and many trading indicators. Protection Against Trading at the Wrong Time Trade only when the time is right. Use filters to start the trading robot to avoid buying too early at high prices or selling too early at low prices. In the start filters, you can set many conditions and their combinations so that the bot starts cryptocurrency trading strictly in accordance with your trading strategy. Trailing Stop The crypto bot will monitor price changes and will close the position when the price is at its most profitable for the entire tracking period. Signals from signal providers You can subscribe to signals that will be the condition for starting the trading robot. A signal is a trigger for the cryptobot to act (buy or sell). Signals are provided by signal providers, who generate them using their own algorithms. Automatic flipping of the bot's algorithm Use automatic reversal of the autobot's trading algorithm to implement a risk hedging mechanism. Taxonomy Group autotrader bots by previously created tags for easy work with statistics. Trading Pair Automatic Switching Trading pair automatic switching according to a predefined list.

        "thought": "The hyperlinks extracted from the website provide additional resources, support documentation, and a variety of publications featuring RevenueBot. These publications from different crypto-related news outlets suggest some level of recognition in the industry. While this does not guarantee legitimacy, it shows that the website is engaged with the community and has made an effort to be featured in the media. I have collected enough information to make a decision. The website has been operating since 2018, maintains an active SSL certificate, and has a presence in different media outlets. While WHOIS information is private, this practice is not uncommon for privacy reasons. Mixed user feedback does not conclusively indicate a scam, and the business model of taking a percentage of profits is not necessarily fraudulent. There is no definitive evidence of the characteristics of scam websites as listed, such as unusually low prices, unrealistic financial claims, or targeting human psychological weaknesses in a manipulative way. I now know the final answer. Based on the information gathered, there is not enough evidence to conclusively determine that https://revenuebot.io/ is a scam website.",
