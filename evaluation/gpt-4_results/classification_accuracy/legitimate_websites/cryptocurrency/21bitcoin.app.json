FAQ What is bitcoin? Nobody knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is. But he, she or a collective had a vision for a new currency in 2008. The result was Bitcoin - a fundamentally new method of storing and transferring value. In contrast to conventional financial networks, Bitcoin does not require any central authorities or trustworthy parties, and there is only a limited number of bitcoin, which means that it retains its value in a similar way to gold, for example. ‍ What are the fees at 21bitcoin? 21bitcoin offers a cost-efficient and transparent fee structure starting at 0.79%. Fees vary depending on purchase and account type. 21bitcoin charges no monthly account fees, no administration fees, no deposit fees, no Bitcoin custody fees and no account opening fees. How are the coins safely stored? Is there insurance? At 21bitcoin, your bitcoin is 100% secured by cold storage technology in Class III vaults and backed by a $250 million insurance policy from our partner BitGo Custody.
