He is an old, rich, childless Italian gentleman with no heir his fortune, and he values wealth above all else. His name means sly fox, which is a perfect allegory for his character, since he spends the entire play joyfully deceiving Voltore, Corbaccio, and Corvino into believing that each one will be the sole heir to his fortune, all the while becoming wealthier through them. He is extremely greedy, and he takes immense pleasure in fooling the other Italian men. While Volpone’s pursuits begin as comedic and light-hearted, they eventually progress to the extreme when Volpone attempts to rape Corvino’s wife, Celia. Though he makes fun of the others for their excessive greed, and though he gets away with many of his tricks, Volpone ultimately proves insatiably greedy for pleasure and trickery. Instead of quitting while he is ahead, Volpone fakes his death, creating a chaos in which he is ultimately discovered, stripped of his wealth, and effectively sentenced to execution.\\n\\n· **Mosca:** Mosca’s name means fly, and like a fly, Mosca buzzes around whispering in the ears of all the other characters in the play. He is Volpone’s parasite, meaning hanger-on, and he makes his living by doing Volpone’s bidding. Mosca writes and stages a small play within the play, and through that play he orchestrates Volpone’s elaborate ruses, showing his masterful usage of language and acute improvisational skills. He is praised for his “quick fiction,” which can be drawn in parallel with the playwright’s “quick comedy,” referred to in the Prologue. Mosca, thus, can be seen as an analogue for Jonson himself. Mosca takes joy in working for Volpone, but he’s treacherous above all: he easily convinces Voltore, Corbaccio, and Corvino that he is on each of their sides (when he’s really on Volpone’s side alone), and then, when he spies an opportunity to trick even Volpone, he takes it. During Volpone’s faked death, Mosca assumes the role as his heir, inverts the social structure by acting above his rank, and he ultimately causes all of the ruses to unravel in an attempt to win part of Volpone’s fortune for himself.\\n\\n· **Voltore:** Voltore means “vulture,” and, true to his name, Voltore is one of the Italian men lurking around Volpone’s deathbed hoping to inherit his wealth. He is a well-spoken lawyer, and Mosca praises him disingenuously for his ability to speak so well and argue any side of a case. Later in the play, when Volpone is accused of raping Celia, Voltore uses his masterful language skills to convince the court (the Avocatori) that Volpone seem innocent. Voltore seems go back and forth between being ruled by a conscience and by his greed. When he believes that Volpone is dead and Mosca has been named the heir, he recants his testimony before the Avocatori out of guilt. But when Voltore learns that he still might inherit Volpone’s fortune, he pretends to be possessed by the devil to argue that his original false testimony was true. The play emphasizes the importance of language, which might be the reason (in addition to his flashes of moral integrity) that Voltore’s punishment at the play’s end is less severe than the punishments of other characters.\\n\\n· **Corbaccio:** Corbaccio’s name means “raven.” Another bird of prey figure, he is a doddering old man who, like Voltore and Corvino, hopes to be named Volpone’s heir. Corbaccio doesn’t hear well, and he is old and infirm, so his hope is only to live longer than Volpone. Whenever he receives news of Volpone’s (false) illness, Corbaccio openly expresses joy, even saying that hearing that Volpone is dying fills him with youth and energy. Part of Corbaccio’s desire for wealth seems altruistic, as he wants to leave his own fortune to his son Bonario. However, Mosca is easily able to manipulate Corbaccio into disinheriting Bonario. While Corbaccio initially does this in the hope of increasing the wealth he’ll eventually leave to his son, Corbaccio ultimately becomes corrupted and caught up in Mosca’s schemes, and the court forcibly transfers all of Corbaccio’s assets to Bonario.\\n\\n· **Bonario:** Corbaccio’s son. Bonario’s name comes from the Italian word for “good,” and he represents goodness in the play. He is a valiant, morally righteous figure who maintains family values despite being disinherited by his father. Though Mosca attempts to manipulate him, Bonario is able to resist this manipulation more so than other characters in the play, and he courageously rescues Celia from Volpone’s attempted rape. In court, he refuses to lie, and he claims that truth will be his only testimony.\\n\\n· **Corvino:** Corvino, whose name means “crow,” is the final ‘bird’ hoping to inherit Volpone’s wealth. He is a merchant, and he is both greedy and controlling to an extreme. He’s cruel to his wife Celia, whom he confines to their home, and he is so jealous of other men looking at her that he tries to prevent her from getting too close to the windows. However, his financial greed proves more powerful than his jealousy and desire for control; having heard that doctors have prescribed a night with a woman as the only cure for Volpone’s illness, Corvino tries to force Celia to sleep with Volpone in order to secure his place as Volpone’s heir. By the end of the play, Corvino is willing to pretend that Celia cheated on him, preferring to be publicly recognized as a cuckold than to admit that he tried to force his wife into infidelity to obtain someone else’s wealth.\\n\\n· **Celia:** Celia is Corvino’s wife and her name means “heaven.” She is innocent, good, and religious, and she’s faithful to Corvino despite his suspicious. When Volpone tries to rape her she resists, and in court she constantly appeals to heaven to expose Volpone. She represents the Renaissance ideal of a woman: chaste, silent, and obedient. At the play’s end, she is freed from her marriage to Corvino by court order, but not necessarily permitted to remarry.\\n\\n· **Sir Politic Would-be:** Sir Politic Would-be is an English knight, but he only gained his knighthood at a time when the English throne sold knighthoods out to make money. As an English traveler in Venice, he has been warned by travel guides to avoid being corrupted by the loose Italian morals. Politic means “worldly-wise,” and Sir Politic attempts to seem so. However, he is a comic figure because he is extremely gullible, and he tries so hard to give the appearance of being knowledgeable that he agrees to ridiculous fictions and fabricates absurd economic enterprises. Much of the play’s subplot is at his expense.\\n\\n· **Lady Would-be:** Lady Would-be is Sir Politic’s wife. In contrast to Celia, who is confined to her home, Lady Would-be is given a lot of freedom, roaming Venice freely. Lady Would-be also contrasts with the Renaissance ideal of a woman, since she is extremely talkative and well educated. She is skilled with language and makes constant literary references, but most of the men in the play (in particular Volpone) find her exceptionally annoying. She constantly chides her staff for not doing a good enough job.\\n\\n· **Peregrine:** Peregrine’s name means “traveler,” and he is another English traveler abroad, a counterpoint to Sir Politic Would-be. Sir Politic offers to help Peregrine learn the ways of Venice and avoid corruption, and Peregrine agrees in order to spend time with Sir Politic (whom he considers to be a ridiculous figure) for his own amusement. When Lady Would-be mistakes Peregrine for a prostitute, Peregrine believes he has fallen for a prank of Sir Politic’s, and he immediately designs his own prank in revenge.\\n\\n\\\\- **Minor Characters:**\\n\\n· **Nano:** Nano’s name means “dwarf” in Italian, which is fitting, since Nano is a dwarf. He, along with Androgyno and Castrone, is a servant and fool (jester) to Volpone.\\n\\n· **Androgyno:** Androgyno means “hermaphrodite” in Italian. Like Nano and Castrone, Androgyno is a companion and entertainer to Volpone.\\n\\n· **Castrone:** Castrone’s name means “eunuch” in Italian. Like Nano and Androgyno, Castrone is a companion to Volpone, but he has very few spoken lines in the play.\\n\\n· **Servitore:** A servant to Corvino.\\n\\n· **Women:** Several serving women, attendant on Lady Would-be.\\n\\n· **Avocatori:** Four magistrates presiding in the court in Venice.\\n\\n· **Notario:** The court recorder.\\n\\n· **Commendatori:** Officers in Venice.\\n\\n· **Mercatori:** Three merchants, used by Peregrine in a prank against Sir Politic Would-be.\\n\\n· **Mob / Crowd / Grege:** A mob, members of a crowd.\\n\\n· **Stone the Fool:** A dead English fool who does not appear in the play. Sir Politic Would-be thinks he was a spy.\\n\\nv **Themes:**\\n\\n· **Theatre and Appearance vs Reality:** Like other Elizabethan and Jacobean playwrights, Jonson explores the relationship between appearance and reality, of seeming versus being—which, of course, evokes the theatre itself. At first glance, much in the play is as it seems. Certain appearances and labels (names, for example) are indicative of reality. Volpone, the fox, is a sly trickster hoping to fool other animals. Mosca, the fly, is his servant, buzzing around and whispering lies into peoples’ ears. Voltore, Corbaccio, and Corvino, the vulture, raven, and crow respectively, act like birds of prey, scavenging for Volpone’s wealth on his (apparent) deathbed. Most of the play’s other characters also have allegorical names that reveal their true selves at first glance. This effect is used for humor (the dwarf has the deadpan name of Nano, which means “dwarf”) and to reinforce the play’s sense of morality, as the virtuous characters Bonario and Celia are named after, respectively, “good” and “heaven.” These characters clearly represent abstract ideals, which is typical of morality plays, a genre which Jonson riffs on in Volpone. While Jonson merges many sources and complicates the typical morality play, the plot of Volpone is essentially that of a simple animal fable in which the fox uses cunning to trick birds out of their meals. Appearance, then, can be indicative of reality. At the same time, the trickery in the play suggests that appearance cannot always be trusted. Volpone is filled with disguise, deception, and theatre. The characters constantly stage performances to confuse and manipulate on another. Volpone pretends to be mortally ill as part of his ruse, which includes a costume and makeup to appear more convincing. In a completely contrasting role, he also acts as an over-the-top mountebank selling a healing elixir, and later he acts as a court deputy. Mosca facilitates much of this deception; he deceives Voltore, Corbaccio, and Corvino into believing that they each will be Volpone’s heir, acting as a writer and a director of the play’s tricks. Mosca’s skills, then, are performance and improvisation—in other words, obscuring reality with theatrical appearances. At one point, Volpone even praises Mosca for his “quick fiction,” which draws him into parallel with the playwright himself, since Jonson’s “quick comedy” is praised in the play’s prologue. As the play unfolds, though, Jonson begins to suggest some of the dangers of deception: some of the disguises in the play, for example, become so convincing they threaten to become real—Volpone worries that pretending to be diseased will cause his health to decline, and the ruse in which Volpone makes Mosca his heir threatens to become reality and rob Volpone of his fortune. Ultimately, though, the ruses are all revealed. Jonson’s opinion on theatre, as indicated in the prologue, is that it should be entertaining and beneficial; theatre can be funny, but it should still contain some moral lesson. In this play, the moral lesson is reinforced through the punishment of pretty much all of the major characters. Volpone and Mosca are exposed and punished for their deception, and so are Voltore, Corbaccio, and Corvino, who by the end of the play have been roped into one of Mosca’s ruses. After all the plots have been revealed in court, Bonario says, “Heaven will not let such gross crimes be hid.” This line can be used to express the play’s overall treatment of appearance and reality. Appearances can be convincing and deceptive, and they can be manipulated for positive gain. However, certain realities—fundamental truths, goodness, and evil—will always make themselves known, despite any attempts to change or hide their appearance. Theatre can create powerful fantasies, but Jonson seems to say that, even in the best performances, truth and goodness will shine through fiction.\\n\\n· **Money and Commerce:** The driving force of the play’s plot is desire for money, which propels the three men trying to steal Volpone’s fortune and drives Volpone in his attempt to manipulate and swindle them. In the play’s opening scene, Volpone shows how much the Italians value money when he delivers a blasphemous speech in which he calls money “the world’s soul” and praises it like a god. Money, he says, is everything, and whoever has money is naturally imbued with nobility, valiance, honesty, and wisdom. Numerous other analogies are also used during the play that stress money’s importance. Talking to Volpone’s fortune, for example, Mosca tells money to “multiply,” which personifies wealth by invoking reproduction. Throughout the play, money is also described, through medicinal and alchemical imagery, as the best, purest cure for all ailments, expanding on Volpone’s claim that money makes everything better. In a final, extreme example, Mosca leads Corvino to believe that he will act as Corvino’s servant, and he says that for this employment he owes his very being to Corvino. Mosca thereby substitutes money and employment for a divine creator, who would typically be credited for a person’s existence. It’s a telling substitution, because, in the play, material pursuits become a sort of religion for those obsessed with money. Such excessive emphasis on money is a satire on Venice’s stereotypical obsession with commerce. In one sense, Ben Jonson’s satire of commerce is purely comedic and ridiculous. Sir Politic Would-Be plans numerous farfetched entrepreneurial schemes with the hope of becoming rich, all the while being ridiculed by Peregrine. This absurd subplot goes as far as Sir Politic pretending to be an imported turtle. But the play also gives a more serious satire in the main plot, in which money is depicted as dangerous and corrupting (as we’ll see in more detail in the following theme). The play shows that people are willing to do anything for money, which leads to moral lapses. Voltore, Corbaccio, Corvio, and even Lady Would-Be become convinced that they will inherit Volpone’s fortune, and all of them compromise their values and are easily manipulated by Mosca. Corvino is even convinced to offer his wife up as a sexual partner for Volpone to secure his chances at the fortune. Much of the emphasis on commerce and money comes from the English stereotype of Italians (and in particular Venetians). English playwrights like Jonson saw in Italy a dangerous society in which wealth, competition, and materialism were valued over morality. Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice, for example, concerns money and desire for wealth taken to the extreme, and it is also set in Venice (as its title suggests). Part of Jonson’s mission as a playwright is to leave the audience with a lesson, and so his satire of the Italian obsession with commerce also expresses the fear that London would fall prey to the same obsession and become morally bankrupt in the pursuit of wealth. In other words, Jonson feared that London would turn into an English version of Venice, in which citizens are fatally, blasphemously obsessed with wealth. The play thus hopes to dissuade viewers and readers from allowing financial matters to outweigh moral ones. This message is heavily reinforced by the play’s ending, in which none of the principal characters wind up with any fortune, and Volpone himself winds up with a near death sentence. Money can be taken away easily, since it is impermanent, but the implications of moral lapses are eternal.\\n\\n· **Greed and Corruption:** In addition to having a reputation for commerce, Venice (and Italy in general) was stereotypically known for greed and corruption, both moral and political. Volpone’s subplot involves fear of spying, but the play’s primary interest in corruption is of a different kind; more than political corruption, Volpone explores the ways in which people can become morally corrupted. The Italian men in the play are all corrupted by avarice, which means greed or excessive desire. According to Jonson, desire itself is not inherently evil. Rather, it’s avarice—excessive desire—that becomes morally corrupting. Avarice is first presented (as hinted at in the Money and Commerce theme), as financial greed. Again, desire for money isn’t inherently bad, but the characters in Volpone become corrupted once that desire is excessive. Voltore, Corbaccio, and Corvino are obsessed with becoming Volpone’s heir because they hope to inherit his fortune. Their greed is so strong that they have no regard for Volpone’s life; Corbaccio even overtly expresses glee when Mosca lists Volpone’s fake symptoms and diseases. All three of the hopeful heirs are driven to extreme moral lapses by their greed, each of which violates a key aspect of society. Voltore, the lawyer, commits perjury and helps Mosca to deceive the court, the play’s ultimate source of punishment, authority, and justice. Corbaccio is convinced to disinherit his son, challenging the fundamental means by which wealth was preserved. (Though it could be argued that he only disinherited his son to win Volpone’s fortune, thereby increasing the fortune that Corbaccio’s son would eventually inherit.) Greed is also sufficient to convince Corvino to break the sanctity of marriage and offer his wife up to Volpone. Volpone is greedy for money, but his downfall is ultimately caused by excessive greed for pleasure, showing that greed comes in many forms and that, in excess, it is all consuming. Volpone takes immense pleasure in fooling and swindling Voltore, Corbaccio, and Corvino, and it’s his inability to stop and settle for the pleasure he’s already had that brings him to his demise. After he has almost been discovered and still managed to get away with his plots, Volpone is driven to try to pull off an even more excessive one, going as far to fake his death. This fake death then provides opportunity for Mosca to succumb to greed and turn on Volpone. Victory, then, and excess of anything (especially wealth and pleasure) are corrupting. Put simply, desire for too much of anything is bad. While the Italian men in the play are morally corrupted by greed in many forms, the play also explores the way Englishmen could be morally corrupted by Italian influence. This dynamic is explored through Sir Politic Would-Be and Peregrine, two English travelers abroad in Italy. Sir Politic offers to help teach Peregrine how to properly be Italian without corrupting his more reserved, English nature. Neither man becomes corrupted in the same sense that the other major characters are (a ruinous obsession with wealth or pleasure), but Peregrine does stage an elaborate ruse to prank Sir Politic, complete with disguises and costumes, which suggests that his time in Venice did influence him to use the type of trickery that Volpone and Mosca abuse. The play’s moral stance towards greed and corruption is outlined by Volpone at the beginning of the play, despite the fact that even he eventually falls prey to it. Volpone says, “What a rare punishment is avarice to itself.” The act of being greedy necessarily brings on its own punishment. He is referring to his would-be heirs here, but also unwittingly foretelling his own downfall. Audiences might root for Volpone in his first plots and take pleasure in his ability to manipulate others, but Volpone’s desire for pleasure becomes so excessive and insatiable that the play turns on him and ends with his punishment. The harsh sentencing rendered at the end of the play reinforces Jonson’s moral lesson to avoid excess: all the men are stripped of their wealth, and it is implied that Volpone will lose his life for his own acquiescence to avarice.\\n\\n· **Gender Roles and Women:** Most of the play’s characters are men who operate in the traditionally male sphere of commerce. At the time in which the play is set, men were wholly responsible for finance and they were expected to have power over women in relationships, roles that most of the male characters in the play firmly occupy. However, the play also compares male authority, love, sex, and courtship to the social expectations of women by exploring two examples of marriages, one an extreme depiction of an Italian marriage and the other a comedic English relationship. The Italian marriage is between Celia and Corvino. Though Celia is virtuous, she is kept under Corvino’s extremely careful and cruel control—Corvino keeps her indoors almost at all times, and he forbids her, at one point, from even venturing too close to a window. Corvino’s rule over Celia is extreme, but it was stereotypical for Italian men to be jealous and controlling of their wives. Likewise, Celia represents the stereotypical Renaissance ideal of a woman; she is silent, chaste, and obedient. This is shown to work to both her advantage and disadvantage. Her sterling reputation initially gives her credibility in court, but her testimony is quickly undermined since, as a woman, she was considered to be an unreliable witness (even to a crime of which she was a victim). The power of Celia’s reputation cannot stand up to the stereotype that women are too hysterical and emotional to be trustworthy and rational, even though the men who argue against her are known to be deceitful. The cruelty of the impossible position in which Celia finds herself in court illustrates that seventeenth century women couldn’t win—no matter how virtuous, women were considered to be untrustworthy and inferior creatures. Jonson’s position on gender roles can be clarified, to an extent, through an examination of Corvino and Volpone, who both try to exhibit male authority over Celia through sexuality (Corvino attempts to whore her to Volpone, who in turn attempts to rape her). For a while, it seems that Volpone will get away with this rape attempt, as several men during the play conspire to say that Celia is lying about her accusation. At the end of the play, Volpone is punished, but it seems that the primary reason for his punishment is his continuous deception of the play’s other men, rather than the attempted rape. It’s difficult to discern Jonson’s ultimate statement (if any exists) about sexual oppression. However, it could be argued that, while he shows sexual oppression and violence to be reprehensible, Jonson believes that the oppression of women is less important than the moral lesson about excessive desire and greed. Lust and rape are bad, in other words, but only because they are a form of avariciousness. The crime Volpone seems most guilty of in the play is excessive greed for money at the expense of Voltore, Corbaccio, and Corvino. Lady Would-Be, the second woman in the play, is the opposite of Celia. The play contrasts her marriage to Sir Politic Would-Be—a quintessentially English marriage—with the Italian marriage between Corvino and Celia. Lady Would-Be is more independent than Celia, which reinforces the stereotype that married English women were given more freedom than married Italian women. Lady Would-Be is able to wander Venice on her own, and she is seen without her husband just as often as with him (contrast this with Celia, who is prevented from even leaving her home). Lady Would-Be is also much more talkative than Celia, though the play doesn’t exactly suggest that this is a good thing. When Lady Would-Be visits Volpone, he jokes in asides that she is so long-winded that he’s being tortured by her “flood of words,” and that, though he’s only pretending to be sick, she’s actually making him ill by talking ceaselessly. Much of this scene, we can note, is taken from an ancient Greek book called “On Talkative Women,” suggesting that Jonson might have believed that there was some truth to the stereotype that woman talk excessively (more generously, one could argue that Jonson is merely engaging with the literary tradition of depicting women in this way). Lady Would-Be, however, also breaks the mold of a renaissance woman in that she appears to be educated, certainly much more so than Celia. Her long-winded speeches are so filled with literary references and allusions that Peregrine is shocked when she yells at him. The differences between Lady Would-Be and Celia illustrate different societal roles for women in Italy and England, which suggests that gender roles are culturally contingent, rather than biologically determined. In this way, the play challenges stereotypical gender roles and assumptions about women, though it sometimes affirms stereotypes, too. At the very least, Volpone complicates the role of women in society by showing that women—like men—can be well read, virtuous, well educated, and well spoken.\\n\\n· **Language:** Throughout Volpone, Jonson celebrates quick wit (especially his own), wordplay, and language itself. The play begins with the “Argument” and the “Prologue,” both of which stress the playwright’s mastery of language. The argument is given in a masterful acrostic, in which each of the seven verses begins with one of the letters of VOLPONE. The prologue then emphasizes that the play itself is of high quality, and assures the audience that the play was written in five weeks without any collaborator or any other input. By the time the play itself begins, audiences have been firmly reassured of Jonson’s own wit and skill with language. Within the play, the skill that separates Volpone and Mosca from the other characters is a brilliant ability to use and manipulate language. Volpone even praises Mosca for his “quick fiction,” which echoes the lauding of Jonson’s “quick comedy” from the Prologue. Mosca, then, can be seen as embodying some aspects of the playwright within the play. As noted in the Appearance vs Reality theme, Mosca is like a writer and director, using his plays-within-the-play to trick other characters. While Mosca uses disguises to pull off these ruses, language is his most significant means of deception and the greatest source of power in the play. It’s Mosca’s ability to think and speak on his feet that allows him to deceive Voltore, Corbaccio, and Corvino so easily, even if they are all in the room together. The play also emphasizes the importance of language in the court scenes, in which language is equivalent with truth. Voltore, the lawyer with a “gold-tipped tongue,” is praised (disingenuously) by Mosca at the beginning of the play for his ability to instantly argue either side of a case. In the court scenes, though, Voltore launches into long legal speeches that are so successful that the court becomes convinced by Mosca’s ruse (that Volpone didn’t attempt to rape Celia). Mosca even tells Volpone to pay Voltore because the language he used was so strong. When asked to put up their own witnesses, Bonario and Celia merely appeal to their consciences and to heaven without saying very much. One of the Avocatori is quick to respond, “These are no testimonies.” Though Bonario and Celia cannot properly speak or testify for themselves, their morality is insufficient—their exoneration must occur through language, as Volpone eventually confesses verbally to his crimes. It’s also of note that the Avocatori deliver their punishments simply by speaking them, demonstrating the legal power of speech acts. The legal system thus reinforces what Jonson shows in the Argument and Prologue and what Mosca demonstrates throughout the play: language is power.\\n\\nv **Motifs:**\\n\\n· **The Sacred and the Profane:** Volpone, both in his initial speech in Act I and in his seduction speech of Act III, mixes religious language and profane subject matter to a startling poetic effect. In Act I the subject of his worship is money; in Act III it is Celia, or perhaps her body, that inspires prayer-like language. As a foil against this, Celia pleads for a distinction to be restored between the \"base\" and the \"noble,\" (in other words, between the profane—that which is firmly rooted in our animal natures, and the sacred—that which is divine about humans. Through their respective fates, the play seems to endorse Celia\\'s position, though Jonson invests Volpone\\'s speeches with a great deal of poetic energy and rhetorical ornamentation that make his position attractive and rich, which is again, another source of tension in the play.\\n\\n· **Disguise, Deception, and Truth:** Jonson creates a complex relationship among disguise, deception, and truth in the play. Disguise sometimes serves simply to conceal, as it does when Peregrine dupes Sir Politic Would-be. But sometimes it reveals inner truths that a person\\'s normal attire may conceal. Volpone, for example, publicly reveals more of his \"true self\" (his vital, healthy self) when he dresses as Scoto Mantua; and Scoto\\'s speeches seem to be filled with authorial comment from Jonson himself. Furthermore, disguise is seen to exert a certain force and power all of its own; by assuming one, people run the risk of changing their identity, of being unable to escape the disguise. This is certainly the case for Mosca and Volpone in Act V, whose \"disguised\" identities almost supersede their actual ones.\\n\\n· **\"Gulling\":** Gulling means \"making someone into a fool.\" The question that the play teaches us to ask is who is being made a fool by whom?. Volpone plays sick to make the legacy-hunters fools, but Mosca plays the \"Fool\" (the harmless assistant and entertainer) in order to make Volpone into a fool. To make someone else into a fool is both the primary method characters have for asserting power over one another and the primary way Jonson brings across his moral message: the characters in the play who are made into fools—Corbaccio, Corvino, Voltore, Volpone—are the characters whose morality we are supposed to criticize.\\n\\nv **Symbols:**\\n\\n· **Disease and Medicine:** At first glance, disease might appear only to be used as a tool for trickery and humor in the play. Volpone’s main scam is pretending that he is rife with disease in order to get money out of hopeful heirs to his fortune. In another scam, this time pretending to be a mountebank, Volpone mentions an excessive list of diseases in an absurd sales pitch for a miraculous healing elixir. In both of these scams, any mention of disease is theatrical and comedic. At the same time, however, for contemporary audiences (and for the characters in the play) disease represents a serious, deadly, and mysterious threat. As mentioned at one point by Sir Politic Would-be, Europe was rife with plague, about which little was understood. And while illness was terrifying and dangerous, contemporary doctors offered little comfort. Characters in the play commonly express their utter distrust of doctors, whom they believe kill patients at will, and characters seek and believe in alternative forms of medicine even beyond cure-all elixirs. Corvino, for example, agrees to let his wife Celia sleep with Volpone as a cure for his ailments. We can also note that despite Volpone’s willingness to evoke disease for trickery, he is constantly afraid that acting sick, dwelling on fears, or experiencing displeasure will result in him truly becoming infected. Medicine and disease, then, are often referenced humorously, but they represent deep and legitimate fears for most of the play’s characters and for its 17th century audience.\\n\\n· **Gold and Alchemy:** On one level, gold symbolizes wealth. Gold is physical money, both expensive and luxurious. The opening speech of the play reveals Volpone’s obsession with money through an ode to gold, and the first transaction of the play involves a gift of a gold plate. Throughout the play, characters emphasize that gold is what lends objects and people in the world their best qualities. Blasphemously, Volpone even says that gold is brighter than the sun or God himself. The Renaissance understanding of gold, though, was complicated and fluid. Alchemy, an early form of chemistry, taught that metals were all composed of the same material; the only difference between lead and gold was purity. Thus, with the right methods, one could purify lead into gold. This idea of purifying something and scientifically changing it into gold parallels a lowborn person accumulating wealth and becoming highborn, as Mosca almost accomplishes at the end of the play. We can note that, for years, the play was performed with an alternate ending in which Mosca receives Volpone’s fortune. The alchemical fluidity of gold also allows it to blend with the play’s other symbols, as characters constantly say that gold is the best medicine. This is meant figuratively, as characters within the play believe that wealth and gold instill people with heath and excellent qualities, but also literally, as an elixir of drinkable gold was sometimes used as medicine.\\n\\nv **Protagonist:** Volpone is the protagonist of the play.\\n\\nv **Setting:** The setting for Volpone is Venice, which the English considered a center of sinful vices. Thus, Jonson felt very comfortable using this city as a setting for a story about greed. Shakespeare also used Venice as a setting for several of his plays, including The Merchant of Venice and Othello.\\n\\nv **Genre:** Volpone is a comedy play by English playwright Ben Jonson first produced in 1605–1606, drawing on elements of city comedy and beast fable. A merciless satire of greed and lust, it remains Jonson\\'s most-performed play, and it is ranked among the finest Jacobean era comedies.\\n\\nv **Point of View:** No narrator, no point of view.\\n\\nv **Tone:** Tone is defined as the author\\'s attitude towards the subject he is dealing with. This question asks us to look at the songs in Volpone, and describe how Jonson uses them to indicate to the reader what he thinks of the events of the play. If we do so, we note, first of all, the songs are all light in tone, jovial, and tend to celebrate trickery and roguery; for example, Scoto\\'s songs to sell his medicinal oil, or Nano\\'s song about the life of the fool. Or there is Volpone\\'s song to Celia in III.vii, which lyrically describes the life of sensuous pleasure he envisions for them. And finally, there are no songs after Volpone\\'s attempted rape of Celia. The last one, Volpone\\'s, comes right before that event. This suggests that the presence of song is directly linked to how we should view Volpone; the light-hearted songs encourage a similarly light-hearted attitude towards Volpone and his trickery. But after the attempted rape, the songs disappear, and the attitude of the play in general changes, and becomes much harsher towards Volpone; the sudden lack of song helps signal this to the reader. Other purposes the songs may serve include characterization and the exploration of the themes of parasitism and \"gulling.\"\\n\\nv **Foreshadowing:** Mosca\\'s soliloquy in III.i\\n\\n**Literary Devices:** Through the device of Volpone\\'s con, Jonson makes his satiric commentary on greed, using dramatic irony, situational irony, verbal irony, and repetition.', 'comments': []}, {'title': 'Vaccine Pandemic Deep Dive', 'subreddit': 'DebateVaccines', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/rtv6p8/vaccine_pandemic_deep_dive/', 'selftext': \"As always….\\n\\nFDA is corrupt.\\n\\nFauci is corrupt.\\n\\nPharma is corrupt.\\n\\nResearch is mostly false.\\n\\nWHO is corrupt.\\n\\nCDC is corrupt.\\n\\nAMA is corrupt.\\n\\nMedia is corrupt.\\n\\nCriminal overlords love eugenics\\n\\nGovernment sprays unsuspecting citizens with biological and chemical agents.\\n\\nSARS-CoV-2 not isolated 1-11 \\n\\n”Pandemic” created by:\\n\\n1.

This is what the defenders of the orthodoxy seem to be saying about the results seen in the Nushawn Williams case.\\n\\nDE HARVEN: This is the main question! Questioning the very existence of HIV is not something that should be debated only between specialized retro-virologists. It is an essential question that concerns all of us.\\n\\nCELIA FARBER: Why?\\n\\nDE HARVEN: Simply because 100% of AIDS research funding is based on the dogmatically postulated existence of HIV. If HIV does not exist, it would follow that AIDS research is the most appalling case of total misappropriation of public research funds! And it would also follow that the monumental amounts of money, so far exclusively devoted to HIV research, would be much better used in other directions. Could you imagine what world we would live in, today, if the total amount of money wasted over the past 30 years on HIV research had been, instead, used for feeding starving Africans, for clean water supply equipment, for public hygiene infrastructures, and for public health education? This would happen only if HIV research is totally stopped! And for this, the scientific and public health organizations have to face the fact that, indeed, HIV does not exist!\\n\\n…we all have to, courageously, face the fact that the very existence of an exogenous HIV has never been scientifically verified.”https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/02/18/how-are-viruses-discovered-and-identified-in-the-first-place/\\n\\nDr. David Rasnick:\\n\\n“(PCR tests) They’re very effective at fueling a phony viral pandemic. They’re very effective at doing that.”\\n\\n“AIDS was the first big viral scam. AIDS is not contagious, not sexually transmitted, not caused by a virus, it did not start in Africa. And the official policy is it’s incurable. None of those things are true. Anthony Fauci was the driver of this whole scam.”6:30-6:50 newsvoice (dot) se/2021/07/dr-david-rasnick-covid-kids-vaccinated/\\n\\nDidn’t include the Gain of Function debate because it seems like a red herring.

The first result is about a play with a character named Celia, and the second result is a general conspiracy discussion that does not pertain to the URL in question.

However, based on the information I have gathered so far, it is time to formulate a conclusion about the website. The website has a few red flags such as the use of \"Lorem Ipsum\" text, which suggests incomplete or placeholder content. The WHOIS information is redacted, which is not necessarily a scam indicator but does add a layer of anonymity for the owners. The certificate information is valid, but this alone does not guarantee legitimacy. The search results indicate a medium trust score and mixed reviews, suggesting some doubts about the website's legitimacy but not conclusive evidence of a scam. The Reddit search did not provide relevant information regarding the legitimacy of celia.finance. No Twitter search results were observed, which limits the available information from social media. I now know the final answer. Based on the available evidence, it is not conclusively proven that celia.finance is a scam website, but there are some indicators that could raise suspicion, such as the use of placeholder text and redacted WHOIS information. As an expert, I would advise users to exercise caution with this website and conduct further research before engaging in any transactions or sharing personal information.",
