The posts are unrelated to the site in question. Given the information gathered from the text extraction, hyperlinks, WHOIS information, Scamadviser reviews, and SSL certificate, there are indications that the site could be fraudulent, such as the use of a URL shortener for app downloads, low trust scores from Scamadviser, and the lack of substantial user reviews. However, there are also aspects that could be seen as legitimate, such as the presence of an SSL certificate and the consistent claim of being a top exchange in Nigeria. The evidence does not overwhelmingly point to it being a fraudulent site, but the red flags raised by the Scamadviser reviews cannot be ignored.
