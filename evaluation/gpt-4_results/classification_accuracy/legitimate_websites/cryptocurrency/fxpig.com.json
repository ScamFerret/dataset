It will start with the top coins and will start off with a fiat wallet, instead of a tether coin that is shady and has alot of eyes on it.\\nSo here are my reasonings why coinmetro will succeed.\\n\\n1. They already build fxpig. Just look up fxpig on google for reviews. lots of happy people.\\n\\n2. They have awesome features like every trader can have its own \"coin\". sort of. People can invest into a certain trader and profit with him.\\n\\n3. Coins are burned at every usage of their XCM coin.\\n\\n4. They have a coin buyback program that happens quarterly.\\n\\n5. They will offer alot of coins traded versus fiat, instead of versus bitcoin.\\n\\n6. Did i mention they will start with a euro/fiat wallet? No more need for tether!\\n\\n7. Their whitepaper and website all looks professionally build. If you noticed their website over time you see they still make little refinements and edits every day. Very active team!\\n\\n8. Their CEO answers on their telegram with voice messages to all your specific questions that has not been answered yet. Awesome support.\\n\\n9. The more XCM tokens you own, the more trading discount you get on their platform. They dont charge extra on deposits and withdrawals. (Unless the credit card or bank company charges coinmetro)\\n\\n10. All ico investors will get a permanent 25% discount on trading on their platform. Even if its the minimum and you sell your tokens when you can.\\n\\nPersonally i really believe in this project as the only ICO i ever invested in, and thats because the professional vibe this project has, and the promises of a euro wallet and fast easy withdrawals and deposits of fiat. That\\'s a feature not many exchanges offer, thus i definatly see this exchange in the top 5 some day 2018.\\n\\n**Now in all fairness, i\\'d also like to point out 2 con\\'s:**\\n\\n1. They do not have a 50% profit sharing like coss, kucoin etc.\\n\\n2. They do not have their licenses yet for bank/credit card withdrawals and deposits. But i feel that with the fxpig behind them, they are THE company that will be able to pull this off.\\n\\nCurrently their ico is moving slow, and that means it will have a nice low market cap since remaining tokens will be burned. But even if it sells out, the market cap will remain about 35 million wich is not a bad market cap either.\\n\\nFinally i\\'d like to share, that you can get 2.5% extra tokens by using a referral link (only valid if not registered yet and on your first purchase only). Be sure to ask a friend for a code so you give him 5% bonus as well. (or shoot me a message)\\n\\nHope this review helps you.', 'comments': []}, {'title': 'Coin-metro, a new user friendly crypto-currency exchange with amazing customer service!', 'subreddit': 'ico', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ico/comments/7uf0op/coinmetro_a_new_user_friendly_cryptocurrency/', 'selftext': 'Coinmetro, a new user-friendly exchange coming out in April, It will be a combination of coinbase/binance with high end customer service for anybody.

On top of providing an exchange with sophisticated trading platform, they will introduce new crypto investment vehicles like ETCFs (essentially crypto ETFs). I myself was looking for crypto ETFs before I got into trading, and the reason I got into trading was because I couldn't find any. I think that will appeal to a lot of traditional investors and will serve to provide liquidity to a lot of alt coins. There will also be TAMs which allow you can follow the performance of professional traders or become one, for which you will get commissions.\\n\\n3. They own Forex broker FXPIG, which means they already have tons of experience in a similar industry, and also have the contacts and experience of dealing with banks and regulators. They are know for their customer support and that will be a huge focus on the CoinMetro exchange - people getting their queries solved promptly.\\n\\n4. All fees are converted and paid using their native token COIN (XCM) and percentage of each fee is then burned. Every quarter 20% of FXPIG's and CoinMetro's net profits go into a reserve to buy back XCM\\n\\n5. They are proactively seeking regulation and licensing in as many countries as possible. While I'm more of a libertarian type, let's face it, in order to see mass adoption, this community needs to get regulated. It is inevitable and it's better to be prepared in advance. \\n\\n6.
