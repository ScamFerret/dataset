Since I've reached the maximum number of actions I can perform, I should now summarize my findings and make a conclusion based on the information I have gathered. Based on the information obtained, the website legal-kornet.com is registered, has a valid SSL certificate, and the lawyer mentioned, Nikita Tepikin, appears to be a legitimate attorney registered in the State of New York. There are reviews and a LinkedIn page that mention the firm, and the content of the website itself does not raise immediate red flags related to the typical characteristics of scam websites. The use of a privacy service for domain registration is common and not necessarily indicative of a scam. However, without being able to verify the substance of the reviews and the external feedback, I cannot conclusively determine if the site is legitimate or a scam based solely on the available data. No strong evidence points to it being a scam, but due to the lack of conclusive evidence, a degree of uncertainty remains. I now know the final answer The URL https://legal-kornet.com/ does not exhibit strong indicators of being a scam website based on the evidence gathered; however, without more conclusive reviews and feedback, it is not possible to definitively rule out the potential for fraudulent activity.",
