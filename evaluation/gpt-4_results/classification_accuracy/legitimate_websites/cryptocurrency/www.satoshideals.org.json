This is quite common (although dodgy) practice in direct to manufacturer deals. Basically the distributor is losing their commission, hence the need for an NDA. There is no hard evidence that this is the case, but it is totally plausible. Anybody in manufacturing and distribution knows that these kind of grey market deals happen every day.\\n\\n* There is some [evidence](https://www.top500.org/system/178468) of the C01N supercomputer existing.\\n\\n* Finally, and maybe most importantly, [the application for the rebate succeeded](http://www.grantcentral.com.au/big-numbers-involved-in-rd-tax-incentive/) after much scrutiny. So people are saying he scammed the ATO, but the ATO still gave the rebate after an investigation.\\n\\n* There are [transcripts of interviews with the ATO](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2644012-20140218-Transcript-Redacted.html) dated 18th Feb 2014 (long before the whole media circus, and unrelated to the Supercomputer fiasco) with discussions about mining Bitcoin in 2009. If you read the discussion, it is about Business Activity Statements and specifically arguing whether Bitcoin is a [currency or a commodity](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2644013-20140226-Meeting-Minutes-Redacted.html). Is the community really persecuting somebody for going up against the tax man as a proponent of Bitcoin?\\n\\n.\\n\\n    He lied about a doctorate from CSU\\n\\n* The accusation is that he lied on his [Linkedin profile](https://archive.is/Q66Gl).\\n* CSW attended [CSU, Doctor of Philosophy](https://i.imgur.com/ElpGuku.jpg), from 2010-2014\\n* CSW was definitely a PhD research student at CSU as can at least be supported [here](https://bjbs.csu.edu.au/research/anrl/researchers).\\n* On Linkedin even somebody in the middle of a PhD (not yet awarded) has the exact same listing as completed. You [list the University, the degree being studied and the years attended](https://i.imgur.com/prg0AEQ.jpg).\\n* As of 2017 his thesis is [submitted and recognised](https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/publications/the-quantification-of-information-systems-risk-a-look-at-quantita-3).\\n* So it\\'s quite possible that there was a stretch of the truth here, *if* he indeed did state that he\\'d completed that second PhD when he was still researching (first is in Theology believe it or not). I would hardly call this damning evidence, with which to publicly hang him. It\\'s not like he just made up some fake degree and ran around telling everybody he\\'s a Doctor. If there are other places besides LinkedIn where he said he actually had the completed degree, I\\'d be interested to see that. Either way - he now has it.\\n\\n.\\n\\n    The whole CSW is Satoshi thing.\\n\\nWow, I don\\'t know where to start with this one, as I don\\'t even know where I stand on it without hard evidence either way.\\n\\nWhat I will say is that if CSW claiming to be Satoshi is a complete scam, it\\'s an incredibly detailed and elaborate one, involving a lot of people, that was meticulously planned - until the exit plan. If this is true, how did he screw up the end so badly? What was his plan to finish the scam on a win?\\n\\nI\\'m not going to weigh too much of my opinion on this because I am still open to new facts and arguments, except to say that at this point I believe CSW was probably involved in Bitcoin from the very early stages, and that it is at least plausible that he and [Dave Kleiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Kleiman) had an involvement in the beginnings of Bitcoin. It also seems plausible that whoever Satoshi is, he (or they) does not want to be known. There could be many legal and Tax implications for the real Satoshi. Whatever the real story, it is not black and white.\\n\\nI\\'m just going to leave some of my research trail here and you can make up your own minds:\\n\\nTo get a solid overall picture, [this article](http://archive.is/kjuLi) by [Andrew O\\'Hagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_O%27Hagan) is a good start and worth the long read.\\n\\n[An article relating to the Trust with Dave Kleiman in Seychelles holding 1,100,111 BTC](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2644014-Tulip-Trust-Redacted.html). If this is actually for real, it would explain why CSW does not have access to Satoshi keys or coins.\\n\\n[Again, the ATO interview from 2014 discussing bitcoin related issues from 2009](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2644012-20140218-Transcript-Redacted.html)\\n\\n[Gizmodo Article about CSW and Dave K](http://gizmodo.com/this-australian-says-he-and-his-dead-friend-invented-bi-1746958692)\\n\\nThe [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/2015/12/new-clues-suggest-satoshi-suspect-craig-wright-may-be-a-hoaxer/) claiming CSW to be a hoax, based on the supercomputer, the LinkedIn profile and the missing keys. And no other evidence.\\n\\nForbes [spreading the accusations further](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/12/11/bitcoin-creator-satoshi-craig-wright-lies-hoax/#11e54c166794), causing them to be more widely accepted as fact.\\n\\n[More opinions](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/09/who-is-craig-wright-and-how-likely-is-it-that-hes-behind-bitcoin)\\n\\n[More reports](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/revealed-the-ato-hit-suspected-bitcoin-creator-craig-steven-wrights-company-with-a-1-7-million-penalty-2015-12) that the [ATO were after \"the creator of Bitcoin\"](http://www.businessinsider.com/australias-tax-office-hit-suspected-bitcoin-creator-craig-steven-wrights-company-with-massive-penalty-2015-12)\\n\\nNews that CSW\\'s [Australian Business is wound up](http://www.bitsonline.com/wright-supercomputing-liquidated/).

Before you just join the chorus of regurgitation, do what I did and try to discover some real facts for yourself. If all of the accusations are fabricated, then you must ask yourself who is fabricating it and why? What are *their* motives?
