They are working hard on an important project that consumes all of their development resources but someone higher up pushes another project through. They don’t have the manpower to fully test the new project because their QA resources are dedicated elsewhere. Their options are to hire more full time staff, hire some temps, or have their already taxed team work overtime. This scenario happens quite frequently, and there’s a good chance it’s happened in your business already. QA Mentor can help rescue you with a far more appealing option.
