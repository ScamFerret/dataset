Coronavirus is here to stay! As the COVID-19 pandemic changes our lives forever, so will the reliance on “Contactless” Access Control and Time and Attendance systems migrating from Keys, Cards and Codes to safer COVID-19 Compliant solutions employing Iris Identification Iris-based authentication is also contactless.

GET IN TOUCH Iris Recognition Identifies: The complex nature and structure of the Iris pattern, the coloured part of the eye surrounding the pupil, provides the most distinctive visible feature of the human body which is stable throughout the life of an individual so a person only needs to be enrolled once. The ability for true one-to-many identification enables the iris technology to be readily accepted where the need for true identity authentication of an individual is paramount. Iris Recognition Myths Iris detection, recognition or identification is sometimes referred to as iris scanning, there is no scanning of the eye as is sometimes presumed merely a photographic image is captured for processing by the software. Iris detection or recognition is not retina scanning, the retina is at the back of the eye unlike the iris which is visible.
