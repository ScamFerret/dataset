I assume she also received the single mothers allowance. She also worked 5 half days a week cleaning houses for cash. At the weekend she worked in a bar also for cash. He parent’s minded her child at this time.\\n\\nHer live in boyfriend (not the father of the child) also operates purely in the cash economy, a painter and decorator. He seemed to be flat out with work as she suggested he paint the apartment which “couldn’t be done for 6 weeks”. This gentleman is in receipt of illness benefits due to ongoing life long depression. When they eventually left due to being allocated a council house I realised they had modified the gas meter 🤦🏻\\u200d♂️\\nAll in all this story gave us insight as to how we’ve got it all wrong.\\n\\n\\nA cursory glance tells me she was making the following\\nHAP payment 1k pm\\nCleaning jobs €50 a day or 1k per month\\nBar work Inc tips €800 pm\\nUn married mothers allowance €900 per month\\nBoyfriends income \\n€250 a day or 4k a month ( I recently had a tradesman looking for €350 a day cash to do some insulation work) \\nLong term illness 1k a month\\n\\nAll in all we’re looking at circa 9k a month net income (pre tax 200k + to you and I) and heavily discounted Gas, medical cards, children’s allowance and fuel allowances on top.\\n\\nI might also add that despite all this they never seemed to have any money 🤔\\n\\nEdit: A lot here have accused me of click bait or lying about the figures.

All the jobs you listed for your tenant you'd never get a mortgage, so the best bet is have the county council look after you, you've no other options, working properly will leave you worse off. The current system is setup that if you don't nail the right job from the get go, there is no form of accommodation for you which is the most basic in life security. Your former tenant could have been making bank, but realistically if she even declared the smallest detail of income she could have lost it all and risk being homeless, so your options boil down to homeless or decent income, wonder what most people would choose there.\\n\\nI've no doubt there is plenty of honest people out there that are currently sleeping on the streets and regret how they played it.
