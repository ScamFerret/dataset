They are running a data roaming scam that will charge you thousands of dollars without your consent or knowledge.\\n\\nI flew from Hong Kong to Singapore with Singapore Airlines in late June, 2023. During the flight, my phone automatically connected to AeroMobile, a mobile network operator with whom Singapore Airlines has a contractual relationship.\\n\\nI was shocked to receive text messages and emails from my mobile provider informing me that I was charged 29,951 MOP (3700 USD) for 194.9 MB of data. That is insane and outrageous. I had no idea it was possible to connect to a 4G network in the sky. My phone was downloading a podcast while I was drowsing off.

They were completely puzzled and had no awareness of AeroMobile. One of them just took my email address and said that Singapore Airlines would contact me and sort it out. Well, they never did. I tried to call their customer service, but they kept putting me on hold or transferring me to different departments. No one seemed to care or take responsibility for this.\\n\\nThey ignored me for more than 3 months. After much pressure on my part, I received a generic email from their customer relations team rejecting to refund the charges or provide any compensation. They claimed that I had agreed to the terms and conditions of AeroMobile by connecting to their network and attached the screenshot below as evidence. For the record, I was sitting in the exit seat, so the entertainment screen was hidden the whole time. They said that the message on the entertainment screen was enough to inform their passengers of the risk of roaming. This is absurd and unacceptable. They are obviously trying to evade responsibility and blame customers for their scam.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z57qfjbhjirb1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ce5d292b9f7c31bd00901402dd5a63ca4c61d30\\n\\nThis whole ordeal has caused my family and me a lot of stress and anxiety. We were moving to a new country with our pets and extra luggage and had to deal with this unexpected and outrageous bill. We feel cheated and mistreated by them.\\n\\nI contacted my local cellphone company, and they confirmed that Singapore Airlines is collecting the fee.\\n\\nBeware of Singapore Airlines and AeroMobile’s data roaming scam. Without your consent or knowledge, they will charge you thousands of dollars for using their 4G network in the sky. They will not inform you of the risk of roaming or the terms and conditions of AeroMobile. They will not refund you the charges or take responsibility for their scam.
