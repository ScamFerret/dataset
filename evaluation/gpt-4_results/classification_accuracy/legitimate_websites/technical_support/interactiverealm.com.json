Given the observations made so far, including the long-standing domain registration, the presence of a business entity in credible business directories, and the use of common payment methods through Etsy and Patreon, there is not enough evidence to conclusively label this website as a scam. However, the lack of an accessible privacy policy is a concern that should be noted by potential customers. I now know the final answer.
