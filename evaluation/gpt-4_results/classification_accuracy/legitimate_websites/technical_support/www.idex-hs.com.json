Despite our efforts to resolve these issues internally, we have seen little to no improvement, and we need your help to amplify our voices and bring about change.\\n\\nHere are the key issues we are facing:\\n\\n1. Privacy Concerns with CCTV Cameras in Surau: Recent installation of CCTV cameras inside our prayer areas, particularly in the women's surau, has raised serious privacy concerns. Yes we do appreciate the school ^safety untuk students. Tapi, kenapa sampai luar dalam surau kan be cctv? And yang jaga the cctv bukan jua perempuan SAHAJA??? Plus, balum ke pernah lgi tejumpa DALAM surau perempuan pun kan ada cctv. Mcm nda ckup dluar pintu surau atu sja. We value our religious privacy and feel uncomfortable with the intrusion. Break time kami lagi 30mins, pastu caya kamu dorang nyuruh kami ngambil access card dri tingkat 1, surau tingkat 9. And for asar prayers as our breaks are only 30mins as well so it’s hassle to get the keycard from level 1-9. Siapa tuhan dulu ani?\\n\\n2. Inadequate Break Time and Academic Pressure: We are overwhelmed by the lack of adequate break time and the constant academic pressure. Frequent tests without proper preparation materials, apa susah sangat dorang kan bagi kami handouts??? Kan menggambar notes bisdurang pun nda boleh? Kenapa? Adakah pasal slides yang lecturers pakai atu bukan dorang punya? Dorang pakai org lain punya slides presentation? Class habis pukul 4 sudah yo, pastu keluar kan kami pukul 5??? Pasal ada stud yg bising dlm class???? What even?!?\\n\\n3. Limited Access to Cafeteria Due to External Individuals: The cafeteria is often crowded with external individuals, orang luar orang sukahati keluar masuk cafeteria kami membali makanan disini. Break time lagi inda sama! Dengan fees sekulah ani, org yg menjual ani gila gila jua harga dorang bagi, pastu orang luar sukahati leaving us with limited food options and availability, tungap tia makanan sringgit dua ringgit kamu. Mcm smua org disini ani mampu kan kamu tinggalkan makanan yg mahal mahal gnya. SO UNFAIR! \\n\\n4. Unprofessional Conduct of Administrative Staff: Certain staff members have engaged in unprofessional behavior, including public humiliation of students. Antah apa perangai sorang dua admin sini ani pantang meliat stud dorang happy happy. Contoh tah ah, menagur kawanku ani dapan ramai orang. Padahal YA NADA BUAT SALAH yo! Astaghfirulah mcm perangai kanak kanak wah dorang melayan kami sini ani creating a toxic atmosphere.\\n\\nWe, the students od foundations and degrees have gathered evidence and testimonials to support our claims, but our voices alone may not be enough to bring about change. We need your support to spread awareness and demand action from the school administration and the MOE. 🙏\\n\\nTq\", 'comments': ['I think I saw a post recently like this on JPMC also but there was a redditor who was against it and commenting negatively on it saying those kids are some spoiled rich kids. \\n\\nBut they aren’t actually, they’re just voicing out their worries. My brother is one of the students there, and I know they’re being treated like children. For example, at 5pm after class, the teachers waited for the whole class to be quiet before letting them go, sometimes took 15minutes or more. \\n\\nThe lecturers are another thing, they’re new and I don’t get why the students cannot take photos of the notes. \\n\\nWhatever it is, I really think the internal management / system should be looked into.', \"I've seen too many of these to know it will only fall on deaf ears\", 'For the notes thing thats normal, its not their pptx so spreading it without citations especially from a uni/under the uni name is unethical. Most students at uni level have to make/find their own notes its sad but thats uni.', 'I agree. They said they are open for criticism but they never take action and they said only if its valid, MAYBE FOR THEM BUT NOT FOR US STUDENTS? What happened to students wellbeing state? I think the workload is quite overwhelming and we only have so little time. Our classes starts at 7:30 and ends at 5pm and they expect us to rest well and do well in school? Reach home around 6, eat shower pastu pukul 8 tia? Pastu kan siapkan segala keraja belajar lagi test lagi banyak, where got time for rest? And friday classes, why cant we have class after wrp? Its more bothersome to go back to school in the afternoon. Why cant we just end at 11:45am and we can have the entire afternoon to ourselves? Its tiring, we need more rest in order to have good conduct. I also dont understand the admin. The purpose of having online payment is to make paying the fees easier, ani caya tah KANA SURUH PRINT LAGI PROOF ATU? Sudah be email, sudah besend arah whatsapp, mau lagi print sendiri membagi ke admin, sia2 sja online banking mcm makin menyusahkan MENYUSAHKAN. mcm boleh drg print sendiri wah THEY ARE THE ADMINS FFS ani menyusahkan students sama indung. They said so that its easier for them, EASIER FOR THEM HARDER FOR US! Pemalas! Nada printer kah? Inda tebali? Mahal2 kami bayar yuran drg sana malas KAN PRINT PUN MALAS?
