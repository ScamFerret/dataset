It asks for a CD called \"WHQL\" for a file called \"[PW4026.cat](https://PW4026.cat)\". I can\\'t find it anywhere.

Googling for TriGem Pinole lead me to [the motherboard manual here](https://www.elhvb.com/mboards/TriGem/manuals/index.html). Thankfully, it lists the sound chip on the board, a Crystal CS4299. This is an AC\\'97 compliant CODEC, which is not ideal for a retro machine if you plan to use bare DOS, but under Windows it should perform adequately.\\n\\nGoogling again for the drivers led to [this site](http://www.soundcard-drivers.com/companies/263.htm?o=3), which appears to have both the specific PW4026.cat file you were looking for, as well as a zip file that appears to contain the driver files.\\n\\nI did not download it, so I can\\'t confirm the downloads work properly, but knowing the manufacturer (Crystal was bought by Cirrus Logic, IIRC) and model number should help if you need to keep digging around.\\n\\nAll that said, after looking at the manual briefly (and it\\'s not much of a manual at 3 pages long), it claims it has a PC/PCI (aka SBLINK) header on it, in the bottom right corner, to the right of the last PCI slot. This is a six pin (3x2) connector that, given a sound card with a matching header, allows for greater compatibility under DOS as it carries the signaling that the older ISA slots carry but PCI does not.
