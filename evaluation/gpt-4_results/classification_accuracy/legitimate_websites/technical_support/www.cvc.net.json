The high clan CvC requirements are there to ensure that the things you\\'d normally do are saved for when CvC is running. \\n\\nThere are some potential exceptions however - a lot of players will buy extra refills for 3v3 because of the huge number of points 3v3 generates, but whether this is a \"waste\" of gems largely depends on what you\\'re buying at silver or gold tier in the bazaar. Furthermore, players will obtain legendary champs through the summoning portal thus reducing the points they generate during Champ Chase tourneys. They will also sometimes pull shards if there is a good 10x event running during CvC, but this isn\\'t necessarily a waste because as the math shows 10x events are actually superior to 2x events if you have enough shards to pull the legendary champ AND you\\'re only interested in pulling the top 10-20% of the legendary champs in the pool (and yes, many players tend to overvalue 2x and dismiss 10x too quickly).\\n\\nRegarding the CvC rewards at the highest tier - the Reaction Rings are still quite relevant and can be worth way more than the normal high tier rewards. Since CvC is the only source of Reaction gear, some players would easily invest a huge number of resources just to roll the dice on getting good 6 star lego reaction pieces.', '[deleted]', 'Ill speak to the minimums around 400k.  \\n\\nIts mostly because we want like minded active people.   \\n\\nPersonal cvc rewards are quite valuable, so you dont want new recruits that might hold the group back.  \\n\\nBloodshield can also be build enabling, especially odd hydra stuff.
