As I’ve gotten older, the rides have gotten a little tougher on me. In addition, my daughter tends to get motion sick rather easily. I don’t like the way motion sickness pills make me feel. So, I always take a ziplock baggie full of ginger candy along to prevent and soothe nausea. \\n\\nToday, I had chewy mango ginger candies, hard plain ginger candies, and hard lemon ginger candies. For those who’ve never had ginger candy, it is SPICY. The lemon ginger is probably the mildest. The plain ginger is just plain hot. The mango ginger are sweet and spicy but they also stick to your teeth like crazy. They’re definitely an acquired taste. \\n\\nAs we are standing in line for the log ride, I pull out my baggie. I choose a lemon one as does my son (13). My daughter (12) asks for a mango one. While I’m fishing a mango one out, I hear the kid in front of us tell his mom that he (around 7ish) wants some candy. His mom distractedly says she doesn’t have any candy. The boy says, “But she does.”\\n\\nHe turns to me and asks for one. I tell him I don’t really think he’d like my candy. By this time, his mom has focused in on the interaction. As the kids starts to whine that, of course, he’d like my candy, his mom just huffs and says, “You’ve got a whole baggie. Can’t you give him just one. Com’n, don’t be greedy.” (Oh, you said the magic word there lady.)\\n\\nI say, “Alright,” and dig out a lemon one. (I’m not completely heartless.) That’s when the kid whines that he wants mango, mango is his favorite. I tell him lemon is better but he insists on mango. I tell him it’s kinda sticky as I hang it over. \\n\\nThe kid rips it open, shoves it in his mouth, gets in three quick chews while my kids stare at him. Then, he actually starts to taste it and a look of horror comes over his face. He screams and tries to spit it out. He’s jumping around and flapping his arms. His mom is panicking and asking what’s wrong. He’s screaming that it’s bad and it’s hot and he wants it out. His mom tells him to spit it out. \\n\\nThat’s when I pipe up with the very helpful, “It’s really sticky. What’s left is probably stuck in his teeth. He’ll have to wait for it to melt off if he doesn’t want to chew.”  The mom looks at me in disbelief and a shrug. Then she asks what in the hell I gave her son. (Probably should have asked that sooner, lady.) I answer, “Ginger candy. It’s good for nausea.”\\n\\nI’m pretty sure I’d be dead if looks really could kill.
