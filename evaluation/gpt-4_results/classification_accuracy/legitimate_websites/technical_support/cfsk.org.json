Deadline is tomorrow and they are still working as we speak (12:00 AM EST). Your hard work is why it\\'s worth it!\\n\\nI wrote this as a comment in a post today but I feel like it needs to stand on it\\'s own as well. To start: I don\\'t work for Treering, but this all came out of a post about potentially switching to Treering for yearbooks. I think it\\'s really important to understand how Jostens did the smoke and mirrors routine for years until they finally got caught. Here it goes:\\n\\nAs technology teacher, I took over yearbook advising last year to raise funds for our tech department. Immediately upon taking over I was sent invoices from Jostens in the amount of ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. What? How do we OWE for a yearbook that costs $78 (price goes from $55 to $78 by the end)? Where is the money going? That question led me down the biggest and shadiest rabbit hole I have ever seen. \\n\\nFirst, when asked to send an itemized invoice, Jostens was hesitant. Finally, after persistence, I got it, and low and behold the numbers just didn\\'t add up.\\n\\nWhy? Well first off I had nothing to go off of because they had not sent a contract IN THREE YEARS, so I could not even refute pieces of any agreement. Secondly, a line item showed up in the top right in small print on our invoice saying \"production fee\". What was this? After pressing again, Jostens was making us pay $100 FOR THE FIRST 50 BOOKS, AND WE WERE SELLING THEM FOR $55 a piece! That\\'s right; our kids were buying books for negative fundraiser profit. No mention of this in any contract. No mention of this even on the line items in the itemized invoice. Nothing.\\n\\nSo I go down the lines and - oh hey! - we are getting charged ~~$1500~~ $860 for \"advertising materials\", . Sweet. I never asked for this, you just sent a box of posters. If we made them ourselves it would have cost us maybe $50. But tack on another ~~$1500~~$860, awesome.\\n\\nSo I\\'m already at our wits end by the time the books arrive, and things get even better. I count the books and while we ordered 320, we received ~~375~~365. Why do we have so many extras? JOSTENS SENT US THEM WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION, AND CHARGED US! They claimed it was for kids who forgot to order them so we could sell them, but if you look at the numbers of books it conveniently brought the small amount of profit we made to zero. They then want you to return the books by a certain date (usually in the summer) for a credit refund. JOSTENS ZEROS YOU OUT WITH EXTRA BOOKS AND HOPES YOU DON\\'T SEND THEM BACK.\\n\\nYou think that\\'s the end? Oh boy, not even close.\\n\\nSo after months of being pushed around, I made it one of my absolute priorities to get these kids the most money I could back. I nit-picked every little detail, knowing full well that Jostens had no legal ground on things because no contract was signed and our students had paid a lot of money to this shady company. I argued about advertising, I contested them about the extra books, everything. In all, Jostens waived around $5000 in money owed. Think about that for a second. Jostened erased ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. at the wave of a wand. If you can magically erase ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34 out of nowhere, what does that mean for the charge to begin with?\\n\\nSo finally satisfied that I could be rid of the plague that is Jostens for ~~$1,400~~ $1,475.82, we sent paperwork to our downtown financials to pay our balance and move one. That should be the end of the story right?\\n\\nWrong. Downtown gets back to us and notices that JOSTENS IS CHARGING US TAX ON OUR YEARBOOKS. They collected taxes that never existed, to the tune of ~~$1600~~ $1,614.79. So, livid, I send an email to JOSTENS demanding our payment record for the entirety of our relationship with them and find THEY DID THIS FOR FOUR YEARS. They claimed that they needed a new tax exempt sheet from us but we never sent it in. They had the old one, which is THE SAME NUMBER as a new one, but that\\'s what the problem was. They are supposed to be cutting a check to us now for around $6000 (5/11 update: they cut one for $2,737, trying to figure out that now). Now think about how many schools use Jostens and how many schools they potentially did that to. That\\'s a class action lawsuit in the millions of dollars right there.\\n\\nMy blood pressure is up just writing this. They have basically robbed our students for years, and it happens all the time because advisors come and go and rarely have time like I did to catch them and call them on their crap.\\n\\nSo we went with Treering this year. First off, I came in with fangs and demands from the get go because I was so pissed off and jaded from Jostens. I started mentioning everything to the guy and listed all my needs in what I wanted contract wise and he was like \"yeah our contract is one page long.\" It\\'s literally one page long (front and back). The next thing I asked was the base price, which came out to $35.62 (140 pages, estimated 300 books sold). JOSTENS BASE PRICE WITH ALL THE HIDDEN FEES WAS $58. They were going to bump it down to $40 (so generous!) when I told them we were firing them.\\n\\nSo our Jostens ones sold for $78, and now we sell them at $60. So that\\'s $18 LESS per book and $25 MORE in fundraising money. We went from owing Jostens $3k last year to [raising over $7000 this year](http://imgur.com/a/WYUgM). I have learned that we can do discounts for students with free and reduced lunch, so our goal is to make the books equitable for all students. I think you can do this with Jostens as well, but I didn\\'t have the time during my battle to find out.\\n\\nI love my students and defend them rabidly, and seeing how Jostens treated our school makes me sick. Go do the math on how much Jostens (or ANY yearbook company for that matter) is making on your school and you will be too. I would be upset about any swindling, but public school kids? Our free and reduced kids could never afford even discounted books because prices got out of hand, and all because of shifty tactics and corporate greed.\\n\\nSo on the technical side, Treering is not a big improvement from Jostens software, but I do like the linking with social media and especially Flickr. We post all of our pictures to Flickr for the kids to view, print and share during the year for free, then we can automatically grab from albums and place. The themes are good, a lot to choose from too.\\n\\nI could go on, and if you want to talk more please PM me, I try to tell anyone that will listen this story because it really is an injustice. \\n\\n*********\\nEdit: Admins banned post for \"self promotion\", so link removed. \\n*********\\n\\nOh man that felt therapeutic getting out!\\n\\nEdit #1: thank you to u/behemothpanzer for submitting to r/bestof , I have put so many hours into fighting this small battle that no one knew about or cared about and it really means a lot to me to see such support. I also wanted to add that I don\\'t just have problems with Jostens, other yearbook companies have done shady things too and I don\\'t even know them. This was from a post at the bottom of the comments about a yearbook company essentially trying to bribe me:\\n\\nAnother thing I didn\\'t point out is that other companies try to lure you in with free gifts. A company told me they would [give me a free $50 gift card just for meeting with them.](http://imgur.com/dAwATtz) Like ME a gift card. I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s illegal, and if not that\\'s immoral as all hell! Greasing teachers with gift cards... unbelievable.\\n\\nEdit #3: Thank you everyone for reaching out, it means a lot to me. I tried to respond to everyone, and if I missed you I\\'m sorry I will try tomorrow. It\\'s late hear but I was too pumped about your support! Goodnight and thank you!\\n\\nEdit #4: In a poetic moment, I went to my school mailbox this morning [and found this!](http://imgur.com/rrlRRL9) Haha\\n\\nEdit #5: I fixed up some language here and went back to get some exact numbers from invoices.', 'comments': ['Folks...

        "thought": "The certificate information shows that the website is encrypted with a certificate from Let's Encrypt, which is a legitimate and widely-used certificate authority. The certificates are current, with none of them expired at the time of the check. This suggests that the website administrators are maintaining the site's security features. However, a valid SSL certificate does not guarantee that a website is not a scam; it only indicates that the data transmitted to and from the website is encrypted. I have not observed any definitive evidence that would classify the URL https://cfsk.org/ as a scam website. The website content appears to be legitimate, mentioning partnerships with recognized organizations and projects related to digital literacy and empowerment in Kenya. While the WHOIS data retrieval failed, other indicators such as DNS records and certificate information do not suggest fraudulent activity. There is no evidence of the scam characteristics outlined in the initial question. I now know the final answer Based on the information gathered and the lack of evidence of scam characteristics, I conclude that the URL https://cfsk.org/ is not a scam website.",
