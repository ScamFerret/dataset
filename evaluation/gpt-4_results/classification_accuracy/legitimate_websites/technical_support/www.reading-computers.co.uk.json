Not only can we help each other, but we can serve as a warning for others that might think about getting scammed by by them.\\n\\n# What is this all about?\\n\\nThis subreddit has come about from my own poor experience attempting to get a refund with Infinite Computing as well as noticing that many people on Reddit, Discord, Facebook and many review sites are having the same exact problem as well.\\n\\nI pre-ordered a graphics card in March 2021, waited patiently in the pre-order queue for a year, attempted to get a refund from IC in April 2022, and was only successful in getting my money back after contacting my bank. To this day, nobody from Infinite Computing has attempted to refund me my money or answered any of the weekly emails I have still been sending requesting a refund.\\n\\nAfter talking to many people on Discord and Reddit, it became clear that this is a purposeful decision made by the business owner of Infinite Computing in order to try to make it impossible for people to claim a refund through the normal avenues. Any correspondence customers have with them will string you along so you think that one day you *might* get a refund, but what is actually happening is the window of opportunity you have to claim the money back through legal means is shrinking.\\n\\n# How does the scam work?\\n\\nThe owner of Infinite Computing is well aware how the system works, and will do his best to funnel you down a path where you will be too worried to take legal action or contact your bank, whilst simultaneously assuring you that your refund will be given soon. By doing this he ensures that you will never receive your money.\\n\\nThe scam seems to have mostly targeted people that have pre-ordered a graphics card, but some people who have bought motherboards, GPUs or CPUs have reported that after not receiving their goods that IC claimed were in stock, they have received neither a refund nor a replacement.\\n\\nThe scam takes advantage of the pre-order system that has sprung up due to the global COVID pandemic/supply chain issues. Most other retailers will put you on a pre-order queue and only charge you once your card has shipped, but Infinite Computing take your money right away. This is the first red flag as you now have no money and no product and are entirely at IC\\'s mercy.\\n\\nYou are then given a place in the queue. People have reported now that the queue has not moved for over five months despite other retailers having the specific models they\\'ve purchased on Infinite Computing for sale. That is the second red flag.\\n\\nPerhaps you have found another GPU elsewhere, or have started to worry that this is a scam; you decide to cancel your order for a full refund. How difficult could it be? Despite claiming that they are \"industry leaders\", Infinite Computing offer you ***absolutely no way whatsoever*** to cancel your order on the website or over the phone. To cancel your order you have to email cancellations@infinite-computing.co.uk and wait for a response. I have never come across a business or website that operates this way in years of using the internet. This is the third red flag.\\n\\nIn my (and other people\\'s) experience, you will only receive one response after sending your initial cancellation email, which reads as follows:\\n\\n>Good Afternoon! Thank you for contacting us. I can get this sorted for you. However, if possible, I’d like to know if there was a particular reason for your refund request? I’d love to be able to help if I could, so you didn’t miss out. Let me know if there’s something I can help with, otherwise I can process the refund for you. Thanks\\n\\nNotice that this email does not make *any reference* to actually agreeing to give you a refund; this is important as a lot of banks have a stipulation in their debit/credit dispute forms that the retailer has *agreed* to give you a refund but you have yet to receive it. Also, banks ask that you wait 7/10/14/30 days (depending on the bank/credit card issuer) after the refund has been promised until you start proceedings against the offending company. Unfortunately for Infinite Computing, your initial request for a refund is all that is required, as long as you can prove you have tried every available avenue to let the company know you want your money back!\\n\\nYou will then receive absolutely no response from Infinite Computing no matter how many emails you send. There are two exceptions however - one is that the Director may decide to give you a torrent of abuse for sending so many emails asking where your hard earned cash is, the other is that if you have ordered more than one graphics card, he will decide to levy a 2% tax on your refund for breaking the Terms and Conditions which he promises he will provide you if he asks but actually won\\'t. Nowhere on their Terms and Conditions does it state that buying two cards results in any form of punishment or 2% charge.\\n\\nPerhaps you realise after a few days you won\\'t get a response, or perhaps you\\'ve waited for 14 days in good faith and after trying the emails again realised you won\\'t get a response, so you try to ring the company on 03458624066. Did you listen to the list of options, press 4 for cancellations and listen to the automated voice tell you that they don\\'t deal with cancellations over the phone and to email them? Did you decide that fuck it, you\\'ll try a different department to try to finally speak with someone but you were left as number 1 in the queue for half an hour or until you hung up? Did you try each department and find you were ***still*** number 1 in the queue for half an hour? Did you finally realise their phones are just switched off and Infinite Computing really *really* don\\'t want customers to contact them? No problem, perhaps you can [try their Discord server! (Use the invite link in their contact us page)](https://infinite-computing.co.uk/contact-us) Sign up today to ask about cancellations and promptly get banned by the company Director because of their insane policy of not discussing cancellations! Don\\'t you know you have to email them and get ignored for months at a time? And so the cycle begins again.\\n\\n# TLDR:\\n\\n* Infinite Computing take your money as soon as you join a pre-order queue rather than take a small/zero deposit and charge you when your item is shipped;\\n* The backorder queues have not moved for months now;\\n* You cannot cancel your order easily on their website;\\n* You cannot cancel your order over the phone as they never pick up the phone and refuse to discuss cancellations over the phone anyway;\\n* You must email them to cancel your order;\\n* You will receive a copy/paste response to your cancellation request and then will likely never hear back from them;\\n* You have just emailed someone to ask for your money that they have no desire to give to you. He is keeping your money; ***GO TO THE BANK/CREDIT CARD COMPANY IMMEDIATELY.***\\n* If you do manage to file a successful section 75 claim and the CC company credit your account, please change your credit card as Infinite Computing have been known to charge your card again.\\n\\n# What are the common lies/excuses that Infinite Computing make to trick you?\\n\\nThe Director of Infinite Computing has a few stock phrases or excuses he will use on reasonable people to try to hoodwink them into not pursuing their rightful refund any further. Here are the most common ones you will see in his responses on Reddit or Discord:\\n\\n* \"Our Terms and Conditions state we have 14 days to give you a refund, but that does not count weekends\" He will use this if you try to claim it\\'s been two weeks by calendar date, then ignore any further requests for a refund.\\n* \"We are very busy because of the pandemic/a rush in orders/last Christmas/staff shortages and trying to get through the backlog\" [(Here is the Director of IC saying exactly this.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/slgb48/canshould_i_chargeback_very_new_to_all_of_this/hwsu2ic/) These are not actual legal defences for not refunding you within 14 days. No matter how complicated a company\\'s refund process is, a refund shouldn\\'t take longer than half an hour to process. How come so many people have been waiting months for their refunds?\\n* \"If you reply to an email we have already sent you, or reply to an email you\\'ve already sent us, it is in the same thread and does not get bumped to the top/bottom of the inbox and we won\\'t see it because we work from the top/bottom of the inbox which is cleared every day. Please send us a fresh email if you don\\'t receive a response\" [(Paragraph two of the same post above has this strange excuse also.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/slgb48/canshould_i_chargeback_very_new_to_all_of_this/hwsu2ic/) Having worked in busy production environments where threaded emailing is used in Outlook (or whatever email system Infinite Computing use) this is an incredibly weak defence for ignoring people\\'s emails.\\n* \"Sending me 8 emails in 3 days is a good way to get ignored\" Stealing hundreds of pounds from people is guaranteed to upset people - which one is worse, do you think? This line also gets trotted out after using the previous excuse telling people to send fresh emails - so you\\'re fucked if you reply, you\\'re fucked if you send a new email. Either way you ***will*** be ignored.\\n* \"If you haven\\'t received an automated response to your email, it either hasn\\'t come through to us (sent to junk) or our messages are being sent to your junk folder. Please check your junk folder and send another one\" This is a bare-faced lie as I did manage to get two non-automated responses to emails sent to me, and no response since despite using the same email account. Using Occam\\'s Razor, we can assume that Infinite Computing are more likely to ignore your emails than for some reason using an email server/address that puts *all of their customer communications into the junk bin*.\\n* \"I win any and all Section 75/Debit Card claims brought against me\" An excellent demoralisation tactic, but demonstrably false - as I have been refunded by going to my bank and raising a Debit Retail Dispute case, as have many others.\\n\\n\\n\\n# Who else has been affected?\\n\\nHere are a selection of Reddit threads where people raise the issue of never receiving a refund:\\n\\n[Should I take Infinite Computing to small claims court? - r/LegalAdviceUK](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/th1q70/should_i_take_infinite_computing_to_small_claims/)\\n\\n[UK: have any of you dealt with Infinite Computing? - r/pcmasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/u15hyo/uk_have_any_of_you_dealt_with_infinite_computing/)\\n\\n[How do I go about getting a refund? - r/AskUK](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/t53hyq/how_do_i_go_about_getting_a_refund/)\\n\\n[Can/should I do a chargeback?

He will lie to either distract or demoralise you into doing nothing, which is precisely what he wants.\\n\\n[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/InfComputingRefunds/comments/uqxmjg/debit_or_credit_section_75_or_retail_dispute_all/) will eventually outline what you can do in most situations that are specific to your particular circumstances (you paid with a Lloyds Debit card, or an Amazon Credit Mastercard for example).', 'comments': [\"I've read that if you get your credit card company to issue a charge-back that IC have been known to charge your card again.\\n\\nIf you take this route, it might be prudent to ask your credit card company for a new card, cancelling the one you used.\", \"If they owe you money, put chargebacks in ASAP before they declare bankruptcy.

I finally decided to give up and go ask my bank, my bank declined support because 120 days had passed.

Tyler told them the refund would be processed within 10 days. 10 days passed no refund. I emailed again and by this time their twitter was being bombarded by people asking for refunds. Anyhow, I finally received a reply saying my refund was sent weeks ago! I contacted my bank and they said nothing was sent nor received, so clearly Tyler lied blatantly. Anyway with the advice of citizen advice bureau and sending various letters threatening court action, I was still ignored. This was the final straw, I was banned from their discord and they had also prior to this banned me on their twitter.\\n\\nAs I had had enough at this point, I contacted my bank and provided all forms of evidence and screenshot of this companies scammy behaviour and finally I received my money back.

Collectively, companies in the alliance are involved in mining, industry and trading. They have been actively scamming the entire world and still scam, there has been nothing to prove it, they are good at hiding crime, like Archegos they are a family business. Family businesses get many reporting exemptions, Archegos also took advantage of this loophole to get away with it for so long. JP Morgan has [been in trouble with precious metal spoofing by the DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-jp-morgan-traders-convicted-fraud-attempted-price-manipulation-and-spoofing-multi-year) but I will not draw any assumptions with this, take it as you will. The only tie I could see with that is Deutsche Bank since the CFTC alleged that Deutsche Bank had engaged in spoofing in the precious metals market between 2008 and 2013. I truly believe that hedge funds have been cut throat about precious metals since 2008 to the point they are willing to scam each other over it.\\n\\n**TL;DR: In March, the GME runup was due to the collapse of Archegos Capital Management caused major losses for Credit Suisse and Greenhill Capital. There are suspicions of insider trading and possible connections to the previous debacle of Greensill Capital. Credit Suisse faced further troubles due to exposure to Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance, which is under investigation for suspected fraud, fraudulent trading, and money laundering. Greensill Capital is expected to undergo liquidation in late 2024. The situation involves complex financial dealings and potential fraud that affected several major financial institutions, including SoftBank Group and Apollo Global Management. The links between Archegos, Greensill, and Credit Suisse, along with the role of GFG Alliance and its CEO Sanjeev Gupta, are being scrutinized by regulatory authorities worldwide.

Fucking legends.**\\n\\nThe Gupta Family Group, also known as GFG Alliance is an international group of businesses associated with businessman Sanjeev Gupta and the British Gupta family. Collectively, companies in the alliance are involved in mining, industry and trading. They have been actively scamming the entire world and still scam, there has been nothing to prove it, they are good at hiding crime, like Archegos they are a family business. Family businesses get many reporting exemptions, Archegos also took advantage of this loophole to get away with it for so long. JP Morgan has [been in trouble with precious metal spoofing by the DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-jp-morgan-traders-convicted-fraud-attempted-price-manipulation-and-spoofing-multi-year) but I will not draw any assumptions with this, take it as you will. The only tie I could see with that is Deutsche Bank since the CFTC alleged that Deutsche Bank had engaged in spoofing in the precious metals market between 2008 and 2013. I truly believe that hedge funds have been cut throat about precious metals since 2008 to the point they are willing to scam each other over it.\\n\\n**TL;DR: In March, the GME runup was due to the collapse of Archegos Capital Management caused major losses for Credit Suisse and Greenhill Capital. There are suspicions of insider trading and possible connections to the previous debacle of Greensill Capital. Credit Suisse faced further troubles due to exposure to Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance, which is under investigation for suspected fraud, fraudulent trading, and money laundering. Greensill Capital is expected to undergo liquidation in late 2024. The situation involves complex financial dealings and potential fraud that affected several major financial institutions, including SoftBank Group and Apollo Global Management. The links between Archegos, Greensill, and Credit Suisse, along with the role of GFG Alliance and its CEO Sanjeev Gupta, are being scrutinized by regulatory authorities worldwide.

Couple of weird coincidences that drive me bananas:\\n\\n+ Eh-Em-See-Ex was being shorted, publicly, by Melvin and by Maplelane (another hedge fund that gets nowhere near enough attention - they were short GME and tons of other \"meme\" stocks). Meanwhile, popcorn was *NOT.*  \\n&nbsp;\\n+ Eh-Em-See-Ex had 90% SI per yahoo finance and was near the top of Bloomberg lists as well.
