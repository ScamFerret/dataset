        "observation": "Statistical Software :: Multiple Linear Regression  Advanced Technologies for Decision Makers Consulting Development Internet Statistical Analysis Muliple Variable Regression Applied Analytic Systems' Multiple                Regression Analysis components were designed so                that a developer with little knowledge of                statistics and some database application                development skills, can program an application                with full OLS                regression analysis capabilities. The components contain                all of the mathematics required for regression                modeling analysis of data from datasets in which                a relationship between the data in multiple                datafields is suspected. Advanced Regression        Modeling & Analysis The MLR components        support transformation of the data contained in database        table fields. For any variable y = b 0 1 n possible transformations        of x j field1*field2 ln(field1) 1/field1 k where field2 Response variables can        also be transformed to achieve a curvi-linear regression        model. Modeling the data transformations is explained in        the MLR Help file. References for        Regression Analysis Before programming a        regression application, review of regression theory would        be very helpful. Both of the following        texts are highly recommended as references for multiple        variable regression techniques. The text by J. Wesley        Barnes is more introductory in nature. Statistical Analysis for                Engineers and Scientists by J. Wesley                Barnes, 1994 Applied Regression Analysis by Norman R. Draper,                Harry Smith, 1998 How the Components Work The initial version        included a TTable descendent component (TMLRTable) class        and a TQuery descendent (TMLRQuery) component class. Each        of these required the presence of the Borland Database        Engine on the target system. Version 2.0 replaces the        TMLRTable and TMLRQuery with a single TDatasource        descendent, TMLRDatasource, making the component set        independent of the database engine. This new component        can be used with any TDataset descendent which implements        the typical dataset navigation methods, e.g. TADOTable TClientDataset TDBISAMTable/Query TIBTable TTable/Query TYourOwn TDataset The TMLRDatasource        component loads the data contained in its assigned        Dataset property, and performs the developer-defined        modeling and the associated required mathematical        calculations. TMLRegress Features Instantaneously                performs regression on any numeric data                accessible through any TDataset compatible                database engine. No                need for your customers to to export data from to Scatter                plots quickly show whether a linear                data trend appears to be present among any                of the control variables and the response                variable. A                variety of residual                plots are available to access whether the general                assumptions of a linear regression model are                satisfied. Plots                of residuals, y vs x i , for each i, and the cumulative                distribution function can be viewed using the                component plotting methods, or via another                third-party graphing utility using the component                properties. Can                identify outlying data and predict the value of                the dependent variable for different inputs of                independent variable values. Delphi                VCL Components allow developers to set all the                parameters visually at design time if                appropriate, or to develop complex models at run                time.

Consulting Assistance We recognize that, under        any circumstance, programming multivariate regression        applications is not the easiest development activity.        Applied Analytic Systems is available to assist        developers with integrating MLR components into their        applications, for statistical modeling assistance, for        custom statistical programming, and and for code review. In most cases, we can        provide substantial assistance with three or four        billable hours.
