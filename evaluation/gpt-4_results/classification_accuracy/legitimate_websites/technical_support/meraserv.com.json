Good on Ifixit for doing this and putting peoples lives first. \\n\\nAll tech should have cct diags and repair manuals available by manufacturers. All equipment should also be repairable down too component level. This would stop a massive amount of waste going to landfills. This in particular should apply to the motor industry. \\n\\nProblem is that sales would slow down, while on the other hand spares sales and prices will rise.  I have a tiny compressor that will be junked because I cannot get an adjustable pressure switch. Theoretically a $5 part that used to sell for $20, is not available. Two other safety parts are another $35. So I buy a new similar compressor for $120 and a lot of waste goes to recycling.

In my experience, 90% of vendors are happy to provide service manuals to customers without issue. 10% will make you jump through some hoops, like attending their service training class or making the manual useless without a software tool to read diagnostic codes, that like the manual, you can only get by attending the training class. I can tell you that right to repair in medical equipment isn\\'t nearly as big of an obstacle as what most people are familiar with like iphones. Although that doesn\\'t mean the industry isn\\'t trying to push out 3rd party repairs. Like I said before, most hospitals and purchasing departments are very proactive about repairs, and require in written contracts that manufacturers provide what we need to fix their equipment. Since we buy millions of dollars in equipment every year, hospitals have much more power and influence over the manufacturer in their deals than individual customers do for like an iphone or something.\\n\\nBut really the manuals are a secondary concern. The primary concern is user training and obviously service training. Having a service manual is nice, but for equipment that I haven\\'t been trained on, we rely heavily on the manufacturer tech support to help us along. We can take it apart and replace parts easily enough, but the issue is that vents and other equipment is so complex these days, with lots of software and circuit boards. Troubleshooting to figure out the issue is the main difficulty. It\\'s not as easy as just reading the troubleshooting section of the manual and swapping parts. Some parts cost thousands of dollars and we can\\'t just \"shotgun repair\" by buying all these parts and hoping it fixes the issue. Manuals aside, what is really important is for manufacturers to beef up their technical service departments. They need to beef up their field service technicians. In most areas of the country you have just a few people working on vents in a 3 or 4 state region. That model is not going to work in a world where hospitals are using 3-4x the vents as they normally do.', 'Are they also being released from their liability if something goes wrong?', 'I worked maintenance at a one star nursing home without a ton of money for repairs. So I had to try to repair as muCh as possible in house. When I see this headline I think of Arjo. We had like 4 Arjo Lifts and two Arjo bathtubs. And those fucking machines were worthless and broke all the time. When I first started I had heard that the bath handle/shower head we needed was expensive. But it wasn’t until the tub needed repaired that I asked the Arjo repairman if he had an extra shower head we could consider putting on. He went ahead and put it on anyways, when I got the invoice weeks later it was $495.00!! It was a piece of plastic with a trigger that squirts water. This was the beginning of me and the Arjo repair not getting along. They wouldn’t send me manuals to the lifts or the tubs. Just for that guy to show up it was like $500 for travel then $250 per hour labor. I took some of those lifts apart and they weren’t that complicated. If I had a manual and a part list I could’ve repaired them. I don’t work in healthcare anymore but I could not believe the repair costs for some of these things.', 'This virus is doing lotta changes to the world', 'I am absolutely ok with medical equipment only being repaired by trained technicians.
