PPMs and TDS use different conversion factors based on the meter. I think there are 3 different conversion factors. So it's hard to talk ppm and tds with growers as their meters are usually different. \\n\\nSo to answer the question in terms of EC\\nCheck out: https://www.food4plants.com/collections/recipes\\nYou can grow amazing plants with these values. Tweaking per commodity is usually done on a grower basis in hydroponics and especially soil. Almost all fruits and veggies will kick but with these EC values on that page. Many years of experience to back that claim up. \\n\\n\\nThat will help show the basics. For example tomatoes need higher N in flower because they continue to grow as they set fruit. \\nBeans need lots of N all the way through. They are a huge bush!\\nPeppers love lost of N in the beginning, then once they set fruit, drop the N by 30% and feed higher amounts of K.
