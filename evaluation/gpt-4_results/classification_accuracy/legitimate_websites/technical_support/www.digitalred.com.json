However, these are not necessarily related to the exact domain digitalred.com. Nonetheless, the presence of a LinkedIn page and Trustpilot reviews for a similarly named entity could suggest the existence of a legitimate business, but it does not provide conclusive evidence about digitalred.com specifically. Given the information from the DNS records, certificates, and the absence of scam characteristics in the text extracted from the website, there are no clear indicators of a scam. However, without WHOIS data or more direct information about digitalred.com, I cannot be entirely certain. I now know the final answer Based on the analysis conducted with the tools and observations made, there is no clear evidence that https://www.digitalred.com/ is a scam website. The site seems to be legitimately associated with a technical support service, and the domain setup appears typical for a small business site.",
