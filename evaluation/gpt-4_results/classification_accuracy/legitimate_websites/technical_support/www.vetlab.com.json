This could be due to a limitation in the retrieval tool or because the website does not have an SSL/TLS certificate. The absence of a certificate would be a concern for a legitimate e-commerce website as it relates to the security of user data, especially for transactions. However, it's important to note that not all legitimate websites have certificates, and this alone should not be the sole basis for deeming a website a scam. Given the observations so far, there is no strong evidence suggesting that vetlab.com is a scam website. It appears to be a legitimate business with a long-standing domain registration and online presence. I now know the final answer After careful analysis and consideration of the provided characteristics of scam websites, vetlab.com does not exhibit the typical signs of a scam. It has a longstanding domain history, a presence on social media and professional networking sites, and there were no immediate red flags or scam accusations found in the search results. Therefore, vetlab.com is likely not a scam website.",
