If this was all the game would be, it’s great as-is. No matter whether you buy it, or download it via Game Pass, you’re getting the best flight simulator to-date. Microsoft Flight Simulator soars to new heights, and has easily been worth the the fourteen year wait.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**[Shacknews](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews)** - [Chris Jarrard](https://opencritic.com/critic/4311/chris-jarrard) - [9 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/119812/microsoft-flight-simulator-review-the-killer-app)\\n\\n>With everyone looking to the upcoming consoles to provide the next-generation experience, don’t let this one slip off your radar.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [9.3 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/microsoft-flight-simulator-recensione-next-gen-vola/)\\n\\n>Microsoft Flight Simulator is the much awaited Microsoft Flight Simulator X\\'s heir, built on a base that is both technologically futuristic and solid content-wise\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Steve Wright](https://opencritic.com/critic/3165/steve-wright) - [9 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/microsoft-flight-simulator-review-a-welcome-escape/)\\n\\n>Long story short, make Microsoft Flight Simulator whatever you want it to be — it can handle it.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Andrew Stretch](https://opencritic.com/critic/2010/andrew-stretch) - [8 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020-review)\\n\\n>Microsoft Flight Simulator is back with gorgeous graphics and even more beautiful planes to look at.

There is just something undeniably magical about flying around and seeing sights that you may have only read about in a book or seen online.

It requires a lot of horsepower and the support of Azure technology to accomplish such a feat, but these barriers are washed away when you\\'re staring down at endless cities and thick jungles from thousands of feet in the air. It\\'s breathtaking, and I hope it brings such simulators further into the mainstream.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**[Twinfinite](https://opencritic.com/outlet/21/twinfinite)** - [Giuseppe Nelva](https://opencritic.com/critic/990/giuseppe-nelva) - [4.5 / 5](https://twinfinite.net/2020/08/microsoft-flight-simulator-review/)\\n\\n>An absolutely amazing return to form for the series\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**[VG247](https://opencritic.com/outlet/549/vg247)** - [Alex Donaldson](https://opencritic.com/critic/1621/alex-donaldson) - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.vg247.com/2020/08/17/microsoft-flight-simulator-review/)\\n\\n>It’s a technical achievement and an excellent training aid, but it’s also a brilliant piece of escapism, transcending its purpose as a tool to become something far more widely enjoyable – and I can’t recommend it enough.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**[Wccftech](https://opencritic.com/outlet/304/wccftech)** - [Chris Wray](https://opencritic.com/critic/1264/chris-wray) - [10 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/microsoft-flight-simulator-leaving-jet-plane/)\\n\\n>Microsoft Flight Simulator is a marvelous use of technology to create one of the most wonderful and spectacular looking games I\\'ve ever played.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jon Clarke](https://opencritic.com/critic/7203/jon-clarke) - [9.5 / 10](https://xboxera.com/2020/08/17/review-microsoft-flight-simulator/)\\n\\n>This is not a particularly forgiving game, and for folks out there that want to see just how good it can look on your screen at home, you may find yourself unable to penetrate the heart of the simulation that lies under this beautifully crafted fuselage. And that’s okay – not every game can be made for every player out there.\\n>\\n>There’s an enormous amount of enjoyment to be had in just exploring, and that speaks to me in a way not a lot of games have over the years. Cruising at 30,000 feet with the hum of the engine, the rattle of turbulence and the world below me, available in a way it never has been is absolutely worth sending a postcard home about.\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n*Reviews posted in the comments that aren\\'t on OpenCritic*\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n**Kotaku Australia** - Alex Walker - [Unscored](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/08/microsoft-flight-simulator-review-kotaku-australia/)\\n\\n>Quietly soaring through the clouds, streaming in the remnants of global air traffic going about their business, is wonderfully relaxing.

I played it at X019 and at first I thought the guy who was showing me how to play was just agency staff paid to be there to show the game off, it seemed like that at other stands. Turned out all the people showing off Flight Sim on their stand were the devs of the game. The guy who talked me through my play through was so passionate about what they were doing and the features of the game. My 15 mins with it blew me away and already had me convinced I wanted to play day one.', 'I had no idea this was the Plague Tale developer. Their portfolio certainly took a turn with their last two games.', 'Have they published the required Download & Upload speed required to stream those Bing map data or is it optional? I am not sure if my 3rd world internet can play this.', \"Just a quick note: the game has a mandatory 91 GB download (more if you got any of the Deluxe editions) that shows up once you start the game. The download defaults to the system drive's AppData but can be placed anywhere on your PC\", 'I need a cheap hotas to play this game with. Any recommendations under $50?']}]"
