So it’s only right we give you some tips that keep you vigilant against misleading projects. These scams aren’t stopping anytime soon so we, as a community, can help each other identify some common patterns that separate legitimate innovations like us from the misleading scum. \\n\\n1. Be aware of the project’s purpose \\n\\nAnswer these questions when thinking or researching the project; does this project try to do something new and innovative? Are they trying to contribute to the new digital economy with their project? Is there a unique value proposition here?\\n\\nThis may seem like common-sense. But, by asking them, you will already weed out a portion of scams.\\n\\n2. Smart contract audits\\n\\nAudits are supposed to make sure that the code is secure. While they are an essential part of smart contract development, many developers deploy their code without any audits. This can greatly increase the risk of using these contracts. \\nNote audits are very expensive.\\n\\nLegitimate projects will typically be able to pay for audits, but scam projects usually won’t bother.\\n\\nSo, does it mean that if a project had an audit, it’s completely safe to use? No. Audits are necessary, but no audit will ever mean total safety. Always be aware of the risks of depositing your funds into a smart contract.\\n\\n\\n3. Are the founders anonymous?\\n\\nAre projects with anonymous founders bad? NO . Are projects with anonymous founders more difficult to be held accountable for malicious behavior? YES.\\nLet’s get that out of the way first. The internet has given us freedom of anonymity which can be great and sometimes frightening. However, teams with anonymous founders still pose a risk you might need to consider. Make sure you are at least receiving updates from the team and respectable questions by users are being answered.  \\n\\nPlease Note not all projects led by anonymous teams are scams. There are certainly many examples of legitimate projects with anonymous teams out there, just add to your evaluation. \\n\\n\\n4. How Are Tokens Being Distributed \\n \\nToken economics is a vital factor to consider when researching a DeFi project. “One of the ways a scammer can make money is inflating the token price while having a huge holding and then dumping it on the market” - academy.binance.com \\n\\nHow are the tokens distributed? Is it through an exclusive pre-sale? Is it an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)? Are they doing an IEO where a crypto exchange is putting their reputation \\n\\nIt’s difficult to get ahold of Token distribution models which in itself can be a red flag.\\n\\n\\nHope these tips help ☺️\\n\\nFor more information on Moonstar and the team, click here: https://moonstartoken.com/#dearflip-df_1516/1/\\nMoonstar’s Audit : https://moonstartoken.com/#dearflip-df_1479/1/', 'comments': [\"I'm moonstar\", 'Thank you for the information :)', 'MOONSTAR TO THE MOON', 'Thank you for taking the time to make this.

He is a moderator and can pick a winner at every jackpot game that is played.It doesn't matter how low the chances are. He asked me to pick a winner to confirm that he actually can pick these people.   \\nBecause I was curious I picked the guy with the lowest chance of winning, two rounds in a row and told him the username. He actually made those people win.  \\nHe then asked me to make an account so we can share the money and split it, I obviously declined this offer and went public immediatly afterwards, reporting it to the authorities. I have screenshots of the whole conversation as proof if someone is interested. I thought I might share this story with you guys since it is likely one of you stumbles across this page, maybe losing all their money. So watch out and don't go gamble there.Let's get back to my report.   \\nIf you like what I do feel free to upvote, comment or leave a tip in the jar =)  \\n\\n\\nDay 10:  \\nWell, today is Elon Musk day again.   \\nOne tweet and the FUD kicks in, and pretty much every asset goes down. I'm not happy with his impact - let it be good or bad for any asset - One man shall not be able to have such an impact on crypto or any given asset at all.  \\nNon the less MoonStar kinda stood strong compared to the top 100 coins, where pretty much everything besides some exclusives are bleeding heavily. It is a good opportunity to buy the dip and make some more money longterm, but it is not the way it should be.  \\nLooking at the chart we can see a minor downwards trend for now, nothing too crazy tho.  \\nI don't have any real TA on such a day today, since in those type of events every kind of TA is pretty much useless because the assets are under influence of outside factors and FUD spreading.\\n\\n[MoonStar Poocoin chart - 24 hours change](https://preview.redd.it/5v6810t0kyy61.png?width=1102&format=png&auto=webp&s=68b2839be3e549863e27630e0b8af8225f37cf89)\\n\\nLooking at the top 25 wallets we can see that 3 wallets have sold, 1 minor sale and 2 people sold their position at the lower ranks, leaving the top 25 - welcoming two new addresses in the club of big bags.  \\nThe rest is pretty much green and good looking, besides all the FUD in the market this one stood kind of strong.\\n\\n[Top 25 MoonStar wallets - 24 Hours change](https://preview.redd.it/p7etcxjbkyy61.png?width=967&format=png&auto=webp&s=0155bf0e48a532698084b8d939e1ae4e9bc15a9d)\\n\\nSo thats it for me for today,   \\nI wanted to spread awareness amongst the crypto users with the scams out there and hopefully reach some people. I guess it will take a while until the authorities get into it and take it down.  \\n And eventually it will just reopen under another name.   \\nBut if I can safe at least one person, then this is already worth it.Stay healthy and have a nice day!  \\nSincerely,\\n\\nHybris\\n\\nMoonStar Tip Jar: 0x2983b94599D00a65A8C185a4B0C6985243dd247D\", 'comments': ['Great work man.

The discussions are about other entities and cryptocurrencies with the name \"moonstar,\" which seems unrelated to the URL in question. I have not found concrete evidence of scam activity related to moonstar.com itself. To finalize my analysis, I should check for any SSL certificate issues that could indicate a lack of security on the website.",

There is no immediate indication from the certificate details that the website is insecure or a scam. Based on the information gathered from the WHOIS data, the lack of suspicious hyperlinks, the presence of an SSL certificate, and the lack of concrete scam accusations, I do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that moonstar.com is a scam website.
