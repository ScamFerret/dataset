If so, do you have any hints tips, or even mind studying with me. I feel so slow when it comes to this, because I have spent so long on the course already (160hrs) and I'm only 41% complete.

Some of the material they teach directly contradicts colibri but for the most past is the similar. \\n\\nMy mindset I’m just trying to get the pre-licensing work out of the way so I can take the state exam.
