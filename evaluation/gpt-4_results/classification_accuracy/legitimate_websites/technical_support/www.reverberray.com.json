Problem is sometimes certain areas if working directly under them get hot, to turn off one you need to turn the thermostat off which kills all 3. I want to use a smart plug at each 3 where they plug in. That way they can be controlled separately when needed, but a routine that makes sure all 3 are turned back on at the end of the day. THe power specs are POWER SUPPLY\\n- 120 VAC, 60 Hz GRD, 1 Ph., 3-wire.\\n- 60 in. grounded power cord.\\n- Ignition current - 4.8 amps.\\n- Running current - 1.1 amps.\\n\\nShould most smart plugs handle this?

But that should be easy to test:  set the thermostat so all heaters are on, then unplug one of the heaters.  Wait 5 minutes or so for the heater to cool off (while the other two heaters continue to operate), then plug back in and see if that heater comes back on.']}]"
