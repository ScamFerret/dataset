SEE MORE LATEST NEWS FROM NCHM Veterans for Housing Initiative Support for veterans of the United States armed services is a national priority, and many organizations have answered the call to help veterans in the areas of health care, housing, jobs, and beyond. We applaud these organizations for providing services to those who have selflessly pledged to protect our freedom and way of life. But the Veterans for Housing Initiative is different. Our goal is to attract and train veterans for careers in housing management. We believe that the housing industry itself, and affordable housing in particular, represents a unique opportunity for veterans to continue to give back to their community while also being an excellent career choice.

This is depressing.', \"There were people who predicted this because they had been watching investors increasingly snatching up housing and establishing themselves as major corporate landlords. The UN was warning about the effects of this a decade ago, calling it the financialization of housing.\\n\\nThis was already creating problems in Canada and elsewhere before Trudeau got in and dramatically raised the immigration levels. Vancouver had the most expensive average house prices in North America already by 2014, whereas South Korea has been in a housing crisis despite experiencing negative population growth for years now.\\n\\nThese investors are who are truly to blame for the decline in affordable housing, whereas the high immigration rates just exacerbate those effects. And if you follow the path of Canada's high immigration strategy, you will find it was the investors who are now profiting off of these conditions that had driven this strategy.\\n\\n* The Century Group lobbyists have been advocating for Canada to raise it's population to 100 million people by the year 2100.\\n* The Century Group was founded by Dominic Barton and Mark Wiseman in 2009.\\n* In early 2016 finance minister Bill Morneau created the government's Advisory Council for Economic Growth. This council's job was to come up with strategies to counter the effects of our aging population, and to ensure long-term growth.\\n* Dominic Barton was named as chair of this council, while Mark Wiseman was placed on the council as a member. There were 14 members total (counting Barton).\\n* So the advisors behind Canada's economic strategy contained two lobbyists advocating for a dramatic increase in Canada's population, and one of those two lobbyists headed the council.\\n* Dominic Barton by this point was married to Geraldine Buckingham, a senior managing director & global head of market strategy at BlackRock Inc.\\n* BlackRock Inc is the world's largest investment company, controlling trillions of dollars in assets. They had been rapidly purchasing real estate around the world, securing themselves as one of the largest corporate landlords.\\n* Mark Wiseman, meanwhile, was granted a job with BlackRock Inc two months after being named to the advisory council. He was made a senior managing director, Chairman of BlackRock's Global Investment Committee, Chairman of Alternative Businesses, and he received a spot on BlackRock's Global Executive Committee. All of this while he and Barton are meant to come up with strategies for Canada's economy.\\n* Lo and behold, Canada announces a bold strategy of dramatically raising our population, and they're going to ramp up immigration rates. Wonder who suggested that?\\n* Half a year later, Bill Morneau announced the Canadian Infrastructure Bank, which was to launch in 2017.\\n* American investment bankers from Bank of America Merrill Lynch helped design and set the bank up, along with advisors from McKinsey & Co (of which Dominic Barton was Global Managing Director for), and advisors from BlackRock Inc - including BlackRock Inc's CEO Larry Fink personally advising on it.\\n* The Canadian Infrastructure Bank would basically turn Canada's infrastructure into investment opportunities for investors - opportunities that were sure to be plentiful given the adoption of the Century Initiative's population strategy meant dramatic infrastructure projects would be needed. The bank has been blasted as ineffectual, poorly designed to heavily favor the benefits towards investors rather than Canada, and only achieving an increase in costs in construction and services.\\n\\nIt's easy to blame immigration for it, since it's blatantly obvious that bringing more people in when you're already in a housing crisis is going to worsen the problem. However the reason we were already in that housing crisis to begin with was because of what the investors were up to before our population growth took off.\\n\\nThe housing prices flew up during the pandemic not because of new Canadians showing up and buying houses, or because first time buyers were flooding the market. The skyrocketing prices happened during the timeframe when our immigration dipped way down due to the pandemic, and it was driven by a surge in investors (corporate and multiple home owners) buying up property at an increased pace. Real estate represented a safe investment when industries around the world were being so negatively impacted by the pandemic effects, with nobody knowing when normalcy might return.\\n\\nWe do need to decrease our immigration back to sanity levels, but immigrants aren't behind our unaffordable housing issues. It's worsened those issues by our population growing by so much and so quickly, but as evidenced by the same housing affordability trends occurring in countries that *didn't* increase their immigration levels - or that have even been experiencing negative population growth - it is the investors who are at the root of the housing crisis. Here in Canada, they self-servingly made those effects even worse through hijacking our government's economic strategy to suit themselves.\", \"I don't think I'm ever gonna be able to move back to Canada and let my children experience the country the way I did. And most importantly be closer to their grandparents, uncles, and cousins.\\n\\n\\n\\nI already live very comfortably here in Japan; it would be very imprudent of me to risk everything I have to uproot again.
