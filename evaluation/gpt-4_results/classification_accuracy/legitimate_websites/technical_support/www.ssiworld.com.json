Send that design to some place with a water jet. \\n\\nAsk for a quote. \\n\\nIf your design can accommodate loose tolerances or you\\'re comfortable cleaning up edges, you could also have it cut with a plasma table and that could drastically reduce the cost. \\n\\nDon\\'t bother attempting to weld teeth or anything like punching a hex through 3/4\" thick steel. \\n\\nGet it cut all at once from plate.']}]"
