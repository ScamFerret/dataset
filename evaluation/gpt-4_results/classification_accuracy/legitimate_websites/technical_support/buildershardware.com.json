(I have a retail CC they manage.) The agent who answered guessed why I was calling before I said anything. She asked if I was calling about an email or text message I received this morning.\\n\\nShe stated the emails were not sent by Synchrony Bank, and they are still looking into what happened (see edit1). It is unclear if all of their customers received the email, or if my account info in specific was compromised. She stated they would send an email to affected customers when they knew more.\\n\\n~~I would encourage anyone else to also call if you\\'re unsure~~ (edited as commenters report they continue to get disconnected), but hopefully sharing these details will help calm some panic. I\\'m open to advice below if there are more immediate steps I should take.\\n\\n**Edit1:** Others are reporting that some Synchrony agents are saying they sent the emails, but in error. Sounds like they haven\\'t quite gotten their customer facing message consistent yet. In any case, do not click on any links in the emails.\\n\\n**Edit2:** Commenters are reporting various similar responses from Amazon and Synchrony. All signs currently (as of 2:30pm ET) point to this being a technical glitch on the part of Synchrony, and not a scam or phish attempt. I will update this post again if either company puts out a statement.\\n\\n**Edit3:** While we are waiting for a statement, I wanted to share the text of the tweet that [@AskSynchrony](https://twitter.com/AskSynchrony/with_replies) is using.

We are aware of an unplanned customer notification that is affecting some consumers & are investigating the issue. We apologize for any confusion & concerns this may have caused. You do not need to take any further action at this time.\"\\n\\n**Edit4 - 4:35pm ET:** Synchrony added the following banner to their [website](https://www.synchrony.com/): \"ALERT: We apologize for any confusion an unplanned email from Sycnhrony may have caused today.

We are writing to inform you one or more emails or text messages you may have received from Synchrony regarding “a trial deposit has been successfully made” or “action required on your application” on Monday, November 25 was sent in error.*\\n\\n*This was an internal error at Synchrony and did not involve a data breach or fraudulent activity.* **We have confirmed none of your personal data was compromised.** *We apologize for the error and regret any concerns this may have caused.
