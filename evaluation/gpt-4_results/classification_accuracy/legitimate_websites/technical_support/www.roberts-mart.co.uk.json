The domain is registered until December 18, 2024, and was last updated on December 8, 2022, which shows it is being actively maintained. There are no red flags here such as a very recent registration date or a short registration period, which are often seen with fraudulent sites. Given the lack of any red flags from the WHOIS data, and the professional presentation of the website with detailed company information and a history of awards and investments, it is reasonable to conclude that the website does not fit the profile of a fraudulent site.
