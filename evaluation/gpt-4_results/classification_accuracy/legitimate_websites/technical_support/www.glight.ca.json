The public justifications are nonsensical across the board. \\n\\nThese layoffs are designed to drive down the cost of labor in tech.

Everyone is overworked and underpaid, and only the no talent bootlickers are left, so nothing gets done the next quarter.

You can sell more product, but that's hard because of competition, as it should be.  You can streamline efficiency, but you can only do so much before it's damn near perfect, without making some technology breakthrough.  Current CEOs are really just fast talking sales people though, not so smart, so big breakthroughs are few.  Or ... you can cut costs, typically layoffs, which is the easy, yet short term, immoral way out.  The problem with cutting costs is, with efficiency at peak, the product sufferers, good employees get cut, or both, which always makes the product worse either way.\", \"And it turns out, it's a good way to raise the stock prices.
