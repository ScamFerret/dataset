I\\'m curious about other people\\'s experiences playing in multiple regions. Especially Europe, because I\\'ve never played on Europe\\'s servers. \\n\\nThere\\'s obviously PF differences like macros or how JP can use duty finder to clear difficult content that everyone seems to know, but also smaller things that just make me think \"I like this better than America/Japan\". \\n\\nA few examples, there are a lot more that I could not possibly fit in one post.\\n\\nThere is almost NO talking in say or shout on Gaia. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever actually seen a RMT shout in the 3 or so years I\\'ve been on Gaia. There\\'s also very little conversation during duties. Occasionally some during PF extreme/savage. Meanwhile on Crystal, I always see conversations EVERYWHERE. Although if you join a JP FC or LS, there\\'s always someone talking so it\\'s not that everyone is antisocial, they just don\\'t use say or shout chat as much. Voice chat is always full of people too.\\n\\nFrontline. Frontline is completely different. JP is so much more fun for me. JP often has a shot caller, and only 1 shot caller, who people actually listen to. And they decide where everyone moves and when everyone bursts. Of course, often there are times where you disagree with the shot caller, but you can\\'t really undermine the shot caller so... it\\'s can be frustrating.\\n\\nAlso, everything just seems more... organized in JP. For example, during Alliance raids, JP almost always does A left, B center, C right, with B tank being the main tank. Meanwhile ENG is oftentimes just everywhere. I will say this though, it\\'s just more organized and quiet. This does not necessarily mean the players are \\'better\\'. I have met many, many truly awful JP players, in both gameplay and personality.\\n\\nAlso, since we\\'re on the topic, any surprising similarities between regions are also welcome!', 'comments': ['> For example, during Alliance raids, JP almost always does A left, B center, C right, with B tank being the main tank. Meanwhile ENG is oftentimes just everywhere.\\n\\nThe A/B/C organization in NA Alliance Raids has been pretty standard to A left, B \"center\", C right for as long as I can remember. B going to the rear Vassago in the bomb fight was a day one meme of people pulling hate unintentionally. Same with the Atomos lanes and Acheron button assignments. The one fight I *can* remember being goofy was Echidna in Void Ark because of how the automatic hate assignment works with A\\'s tank getting hate from the split Echidna for whatever fucking reason.\\n\\nWhat I would say that JP does better on average is assigning the B tank as MT by default. In NA/EU, it\\'s almost always aggrowanking, whether they\\'re being intentionally stupid or naturally stupid.', \"I am also in Gaia and I would say here's the following things that NA does I think quite differently.\\n\\nIn terms of raiding,\\n\\n* Using a strat macro, which is a norm on JP and sometimes used on EU. The chances of people actually reading is 50/50, and often times when the strat is game8-unified people can do fights (esp. old fights) without strat macros.\\n* People actually following whichever the first strat macro that comes out and doesn't argues with it. Biggest example of this is Golbez Ex where there's like a bunch of variation on all of the different nuances on the fight (that even Hamukatsu makes fun of the situation by comparing it to ペヨング Flavours). I don't remember that many times where people argue about getting a bad strat when they queue into raid finder and threaten to get out because that's just part of what you accept when you queue into RF.\\n* There's very little kicking players. It's either you clear or you disband. The only time I am getting close to seeing someone being kicked is when someone's offline due to connection. I think people only do this when they PF and specifically said they kick if someone's bad.\\n* Ultimate PUG besides UWU are very very very very rare. On patch Ultimates gets quite a bit of traction but any other ultimate is dead.\\n* The main stream ultimate strat for statics are way different from other datacenters. UWU strat involves people jumping on Gaols to force gaols onto healers and Casters, ignores a part of predation, and uses tank LB twice on suppression/marathon strat where everyone runs together. The mainstream comp for UCOB is either run with 3 healers or 3 tanks (it's now 3 healers that's being recommended the most I think). People does not use AM for TOP and DSR, there's someone doing the markers by hand.\\n* People does not kick you because you have bad numbers. A lot of people knows about 'the site' but they follow the rule of 'the first rule of ACT is you don't talk about ACT'. It's again you either clear or you disband. That doesn't mean people raiding don't know. A lot of Japanese players I know all talk about 'funny numbers' 'scores' 'colors' 'perf' 'resume'. We just don't do it on public. If you are not even thinking about applying to a static then frankly your resume does not matter.\\n* On BA, People uses stabilizers, and is widely accepted, and expected that you have to use stabilizers if you want to guarantee a spot. You are welcome to join in on VCs and listen to callouts hosted by BA discord even if you didn't signed up at the first place but bumps into a node.\\n\\nGeneral content and PF interaction\\n\\n* There's very little conversation on PUG. It's usually just greet and bye.\\n* Wall to wall pull is usually done on level50+ content.\\n* PF is very clean and people stay to the rules by only PFing what the PF tab is for\\n* 'Say' chat is consider common and public place and therefore very little people uses them.\\n* There's no RMT ads. I mean sure there is people doing RMT but I don't remember seeing any of them in game\\n* There's no public ERP. RP community is generally quite small. Quicksand is not populated at all. I don't know any place where it's the equivalent of Balmung.\\n* People uses lodestones a lot. Official Lodestone is the place if you want to put strat macro and PF. FC, Static recruitment, advertisement, events are usually either advertised in game, on lodestone or on Twitter.\\n\\nPopulation and language\\n\\n* JP people think 'JP only'/'JOnly' is 'Japanese Speakers Only' (in Japanese terms, 'Japanese Shaberist onry') where I think most of the non-JP population thinks it's 'Japanese players Only'\\n* There's a lot of people who doesn't speak english and but the game said they uses E UI because they have installed chinese translation mods.\\n* The = = = = = = you might sometimes saw on PUG is most likely chinese letters that the game does not support, which you can read by copying the whole text and paste it somewhere outside the game.\\n* People do Ocean fishing achievement and do specific PVP matches by queueing with French Language.\\n* Everyone knows Tonberry and Kujata has a lot of Aussies and SE Asian players. The Hong Kong Server is Ifrit from Gaia; the Taiwanese server is Typhon from Mana and I think Bahamut has a lot of Taiwan player as well; Ridill and Fenrir has a lot of streamers; Asura and Chocobo from Mana is the mainland Chinese server.\\n* Auto translate is something that actually some Japanese players uses as well, and even if they didn't use auto translate a lot of people just does not type because they are on PS5.\", \"I used to play in Elemental before moving over to NA, and agree especially with what you said about coordination. To make a very broad generalization, I would say the JP culture of 'not wanting to inconvenience others' was probably what I missed most. Here are some examples of what I mean:\\n\\n1) Being honest about your prog point in savage PF. If you've only progged up to mechanic X but you lie your way into a 'X+2 prog party', you're getting an accelerated prog experience at the expense of everyone else in the group who were honest about their prog state. I remember hearing of public blacklists for people who lied about their prog on JP during Heavensward.\\n\\n2) Taking the initiative to improve yourself. I've sometimes seen PFs for random max level dungeons where the recruiter's message is something like 'new to a job and practicing the rotation in fights, please join if you're free to help'. Anecdotally, I find when doing casual roulettes the average group in JP is noticeably better in DPS than in NA. It might be casual content, but the general playerbase seems to actually put in effort to get some semblance of a rotation going.\\n\\n3) As you pointed out, shot calling in Frontlines with macros and sound effects is very common in JP. It seems the JP players understand that these macros are the most effective tools to coordinate a team and work toward victory, and I've not heard a single protest about them. It still blows my mind that NA players complain about these pings and when told they can mute it on their client-side, insist that the commander and everyone else taking advantage of these pings adjust instead. \\n\\nAgain, these are generalizations and not everyone acts this way. And as you pointed out, there are tradeoffs and the players aren't necessarily 'better'.\", '[deleted]', 'From playing on JP for 7 years then trying out NA...  \\n\\n\\nPeople NA are surprised when you are competent at the game.  \\nOn JP being competent is just a societal norm, and it was rare to find somebody at the low skill level of an NA player.']}, {'title': '[REQUEST] Japanese SMS in 070/080/090 for RMT.club and Gametrade,jp registering, 15$ EACH', 'subreddit': 'phoneverification', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/phoneverification/comments/hdjoyf/request_japanese_sms_in_070080090_for_rmtclub_and/', 'selftext': \"Hi there, I need a SMS verification of Japan phone number with 070/080/090 for registering in RMT.club and Gametrade.jp with 15$ EACH, can pay in Paypal or Venmo, or Zele transfer.
