Each month I\\'d like to do a summary of the past month for the Switch. A round up of common topics, what games were released, and what\\'s on the horizon for the next month. My hope is that something here could be of interest or value to you, and that it would warrant a discussion below about the month that was and the month that will be.\\n\\nWith that being said, post below if you have some ideas about what would make this more useful or more interesting, and I\\'ll make adjustments for April\\n\\nThe goal was to put the Switch into context in one thread, with as much information as I could cram in looking across the platform. Maybe you\\'ll learn something (as I did doing the research). Maybe you\\'ll share something. The point is to create a monthly discussion about the state of the console and where we are heading.\\n\\nNote - this is a very long thread. TL;DR is \"March was good, April will be good too.\"\\n\\n### Console Sales Numbers\\nThe Nintendo Switch has sold over **1.5M consoles** worldwide in its first week, with over 500,000 in Japan this month. But we shouldn\\'t put much weight into this number one way or the other (see source 3). Nintendo confirmed they shipped 2M consoles for the system\\'s launch. I speculate that they\\'ve sold close to 2M now given the end-of-month stock showing up at major retailers, and that the 1.5 number was given by Nintendo on 3/14.\\n\\nSources:\\n\\n1.

The depth of this new Hyrule, along with the story, design, and visuals that round out the experience, weave a tale that we will be retelling for generations, as we have A Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time before it. Is this the best Zelda game ever made? An argument can still be made for those other two, but that just speaks volumes to the vision that has arguably made this the most beloved video game franchise of all-time.\\n\\nSurely we all hope this isn\\'t the only Zelda game we will get before the Switch is some day replaced by its successor, but another game of this size will take many years to create, and there is a tendency from Nintendo to only release one new, large Zelda game on each platform (with some exceptions such as the N64). I would expect that we will see some ports or HD remasters brought to the console sooner than that, though.\\n\\n**Honorable Mention:** Snipperclips - Cut it out, Together!\\n***\\n### Community Highlights\\n* Generally-speaking, Switch owners seem very happy with their console. Posting pictures with their Switch from hospitals, skyscrapers, and Disneyland, among other places.\\n* People are making dock socks! The dock sock etsy market came out of nowhere and exploded overnight in response to fear of scratching the Switch screen.\\n* A lot of people are painting their Joy-Con custom colors, some representing old consoles such as the Gamecube.\\n* Nintendo has increased production and its FY17 sales targets (twice).\\n* Players were able to participate in the Splatoon 2 Testfire event to get an early look at the game from home!\\n* The Switch has very high quality titles if you put any weight into critic reviews. Outside of a couple of stinkers, there aren\\'t many bad games, and several great games besides Zelda.\\n* More and more [Kickstarter games](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/wiki/kickstarter) are planning for Switch versions or are being promoted as primarily Switch games. In the early years of the indie revolution, Nintendo had been considered not indie friendly. It\\'s great that they are starting to become the preferred console home for more indie titles.\\n\\n### Top Community Concerns\\n* Switches are hard to come by! Despite Nintendo increasing production to meet demand, they played it safe after the failure of the WiiU and now they are scrambling to catch up.\\n\\n>My Take: Patience is a virtue. Shipping consoles on a boat from China can take up to a month when you combine all other logistics of warehouses, shipping, etc. It also takes time to manufacture a console, especially if we want Nintendo to work out the kinks from the first production run. Excpect one or two large shipments per month with small numbers of consoles coming out of hiding in the weeks between. That all being said, crafty folks who can spot a deal will be able to get a Switch on the secondary market for under $400 total (in the US) which isn\\'t that crazy to me considering tax and shipping.\\n\\n* Some players report the Left Joy-Con has issues desyncronizing with their console at very short play distances.\\n\\n>My Take: Confirmed by Nintendo as a hardware issue, please contact Nintendo for repair. They are inserting foam into repaird Joy-Con to improve Bluetooth range.\\n\\n* Some players report their Switch tablet or dock (or both) are bent, leading to scratching even with proper care.\\n\\n>My Take: Appears to be fairly rare, but contacting Nintendo is the suggested first step, rather than attempting to correct it yourself.\\n\\n* Developers pricing ports more expensive on the Switch than on other platforms (see: RiME and Minecraft: Story Mode).\\n\\n>My Take: Appears to be just these two games for now. While other ports (such as Lego City Undercover) are seemingly overpriced, they are in-line with the price of other consoles.\\n\\n* Few major 3rd party titles have been announced for the Switch leading some owners to become worried that support will be poor for 3rd party AAA games like it was on the WiiU.\\n\\n>My Take: The best we can hope for is to have the Switch continue to sell phenomenally well. If that happens it becomes harder for publishers to ignore the large install base and they will begin to put in the effort to port larger games to the Switch, despite the challenges of scaling back software for the less-powerful hardware. Buy a Switch. Buy two Switches. Make all your friends and family buy them, too. Tell them they don\\'t have a choice because you want Assasain\\'s Creed on your beautiful portable. ~~Sell Switches outside the grocery store like Girl Scout cookies.~~\\n\\n* Framerate and/or resolution differences exist in Switch versions 3rd party games that are not issues in Xbox\\\\PS4 versions.\\n\\n>My Take: [I made some specific comments regarding LEGO City Undercover here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/62anmr/shovel_knight_now_outputs_at_a_1080p_resolution/dfl2fi6/), but to summarize that - it just isn\\'t easy. Especially with a new console, new engines (or old engines that need to be updated to work well with Switch hardware), tight deadlines, and two consoles that are more powerful than our portable home console friend. However, I do think this is amplified by little developer experience on the platform and will smooth over in 6 to 10 months. Thus I expect 3rd party titles to have more parity in terms of 1080p support and framerate, at least in less-demanding games like LEGO City (but I concede that split-screen complicates things, even in Mario Kart after 2 players).\\n\\n* Indie games aren\\'t real games - Switch has no real games.\\n\\n>My Take: Wrong. See Metacritic links above.\\n\\n* There is a lack of any system of cloud saves or backups for save data. Should our console need repair or the data become corrupt, we will lose all of our progress in all of our games.\\n\\n> I\\'m not going to spin it - this one really sucks. I\\'ve had to send in consoles for repair before, but all of those systems had memory cards. The current era of game consoles has gotten rid of memory cards but each of the Switch\\'s competitors (and Steam) support cloud storage or backup in some other way (such as a hard drive). The lack of this feature is completely unacceptable. However...\\n\\n>I do continue to believe the Switch was intended for a holiday 2017 release. When the WiiU was failing so badly, Nintendo made the tough decision to move that date up to spring, asked the Zelda team to port their game (quickly without enough time to fully optimize), asked other teams who would be ready to ship (few), probably changed their plans and cut content from 1-2-Switch (28 is a weird number), and also likely cut a ton of features planned for the console itself (online, chat, cloud saves, Virtual Console, etc). Yes, I think these were all planned for the original launch and yes, I think we will get all of those things by the end of this year. Fall, more likely.\\n\\n###Overall Community Hype\\n🎺🎺🎺🎺\\n\\n4 / 5 John Cena trumpets\\n\\nThe community is excited about what their console can do and Zelda is universally-beloved. But negativity and gloom are prevelant on these internets, and the Switch community is far from any exception. Lack of announced titles ([though there are over 150](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_Switch_games)) and major planned AAA/third party support are enough to put some Switch owners into a full panic. From day 1. On a console less than a month old. Yeah, I don\\'t get it either.\\n\\n***\\n### Outlook for April\\nAs the \"Road to Wrestlemania\" winds down in the WWE Universe, the \"Road to E3\" begins in the Gaming Universe (maybe that means more Nintendo/Cena collaborations). In typical Q1/Q2 fashion this is expected to be a time with few new announcements and infrequent communication from Nintendo. Not to worry! [Reggie promises a big E3](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-has-a-big-e3-planned-exec-says/1100-6448968/) for Nintendo this year, but that likely means we are waiting until June for any major game announcements outside of indie ports and Kickstarters. Try to remain positive knowing that, even though the console is new, infrequency of announcements prior to June is very common when a company has big plans for E3 and not indicative of lack of support from Nintendo, 3rd parties, or consumers.\\n\\nStill, the month of April will provide Switch owners with their next major first-party release since Zelda in the widely-anticipated Mario Kart 8 Deluxe hitting stores on April 28th worldwide. This version of the game is more than a straight port, offering new characters and [several battle modes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYeD1N_RRTc) that are new to the series.\\n\\nAdditionally I would expect some surprises in the eShop this month, given how many \"Spring\" titles still are without solid dates (though they could arguably fall into May). 4 new reatil releases bolster the Switch lineup, with the flagship Mario Kart 8 flanked by WiiU-favorite LEGO City Undercover (which has a new co-op mode) and Puyo Puyo Tetris (which players are enjoying as an import from Japan given the depth of the free demo). Expect both titles to score high marks on Metacritic, continuing the trend of a well-curated list of quality titles Nintendo has certified.\\n\\nOver on the eShop side we\\'re looking at some high-quality releases this month. Not only that, but most of the indie games are new titles, not ports of games people have already played extensively on other platforms. Click the links below to look at the official trailers for each title and let me know in the comments below what you plan on picking up this month for your Switch.\\n\\n**Dark Horse Pick Of the Month**\\n\\nMinna de Wai Wai!
