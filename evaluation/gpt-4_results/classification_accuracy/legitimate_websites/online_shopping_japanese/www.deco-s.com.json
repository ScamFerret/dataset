Especially in situations where it\\'s not feasible for Wi-Fi coverages to \"overlap\" each node, there is no inter-node Wi-Fi reception which is necessary for packet hops to occur.\\n\\nMany people who use Decos may be enthusiasts, homelabbers or just people who generally want a network that suits their demands and layout. These uses cases will always involve the use of a network switch and use of EB for maximum reliability and performance.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the sad fact is that not all network switches allow Deco units to talk together in order for EB to be established. This is because Deco EB utilises the IEEE 1905.1 standard. How this works is each Deco unit when connected to a given network, will always transmit TWO types of packets: a) a discovery packet, and b) a control packet. If any two Decos cannot receive any one of these packets, EB will fail and WB is attempted instead.\\n\\nFor some reason or another, some network switches DROP one or both of these packets, making EB impossible for Decos connected THROUGH the switch.\\n\\nAnother cause of failure that is apparent in the community is that some network switches will simply die after a Deco unit switches to EB due to the presence of a network loop, and never recover.\\n\\nTP-Link official webpages briefly address this issue, and they name-drop D-Link switches specifically as a brand to avoid in favour of a select range of TP Link switches if one wants successful EB.\\n\\nIn addition, a previous Reddit thread with crucial information that documents this phenomenon is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/j0rn9i/dlink\\\\_covr\\\\_products\\\\_mesh\\\\_wifi\\\\_support\\\\_says/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/j0rn9i/dlink_covr_products_mesh_wifi_support_says/)\\n\\nIn that thread, contributors noted that the official specification of IEEE 1905.1 explicitly states that no modification or special \"magic\" to enable IEEE 1905.1 should be required on existing switches. This is why you won\\'t find any mention of IEEE 1905.1 support in data sheets for network switches. And indeed it should make sense that as an L2.5 protocol, \\\\*every\\\\* switch should work, because by definition all switches operate at least on L2. Yet here we are, having to trial and error.\\n\\nGiven the lack of information about what switches are supported and which aren\\'t, I think it would be a good idea to collectively compile a list of what works and what doesn\\'t, and what to look out for when it isn\\'t working. Hopefully, we can get a strong knowledgebase going 😊\\n\\nI will start this off because I\\'ve done alot of trial and errors:\\n\\nDECO UNITS (EDITED):\\n\\nDeco X50s and X20s in any configuration, AP mode only. Latest firmware for July 2023.\\n\\nSWITCHES THAT WORKED (EDITED):\\n\\n- Cisco SG250-26P\\n\\n- Netgear GS724TP\\n\\n- Linksys SRW2048\\n\\n- HP 2810 series\\n\\n- 3COM 4800G PWR\\n\\n- D-Link DGS1210-52MP\\n\\n- D-Link DGS-108 (unmanaged)\\n\\n- TP-Link Archer A6 MIMO (unmanaged)\\n\\n- \"most TP-Link switches\" in the growing list on TP Link\\'s official website: [https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/1794/](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/1794/)\\n\\n- Juniper EX3300-48P\\n\\n- Brokeaids Turboiron 24X\\n\\n- QNAP QSW-2104-2T\\n\\nSWITCHES THAT FAILED BEFORE BUT SEEMS TO BE WORKING NOW:\\n\\n- Juniper EX2200-PoE (12.3R6.6): \\\\`tcpdump\\\\` from a server connected to the switch can only see discovery packets but no control packets. Connected non-main Deco units have selected WB on some occasions, but successful EB has been up for 2 weeks and counting now....\\n\\n- D-Link DWS4026 (on its own, not daisy chained to any other switch)\\n\\nSWITCHES THAT STRAIGHT UP DON\\'T WORK:\\n\\n- (none yet)\\n\\nFinally, see also \"Fermulator\"\\'s testing result in the reddit post mentioned above.\\n\\n\\n\\nI note that issues with EB may not necessarily stem from direct blockage of IEEE 1905.1 communication. There are also known issues with Spanning Tree Protocols being tripped and shutting down ethernet connection to the Deco nodes. It be interesting to know how prevalent they are!\\n\\nEDIT: as long as you can see IEEE 1905.1 packets with ethertype 0x893a when you do `tcpdump` or Wireshark etc... from a machine that is not directly wired to the Deco unit, you have a fighting chance at successful EB.\\n\\nEDIT (5th March 2024): There are reports here and there of Decos playing up, such as firmware bug, or problems with MU-MIMO, 802.11k/v/r, or beamforming etc... . These often manifest as a severe network slowdown, ridiculous buffering times, massive packet loss and total disconnection from the Deco app. Best practices currently are to disable all features and update to latest firmware.\\n\\nI\\'ve also been recently made aware there\\'s also the slight possibility that Wi-Fi communication between Decos may spontaneously happen (though under what circumstances it is unknown) despite successful and stable ethernet backhaul. This would initiate a true network loop all by itself. I don\\'t know to what extent this is real, but it may explain many if not all issues with spanning tree and loop prevention features on switches.\\n\\nEvidence for this is here but for Amazon Eeros: [https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/obuobd/comment/j9ihc14](https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/obuobd/comment/j9ihc14)\\n\\n*\"First thing they don’t want to tell you is a mesh network is basically a software managed loop in the first place...\"*\\n\\nIf true for TP-Link as well, it\\'s very shitty to not be more forthcoming about this. UPDATE 14th April 2024: the BE95\\'s page possibly confirms this by saying \"wireless+wired \"combined backaul\".\\n\\nIn my experience, I have potentially seen an IEEE 1905.1 packet flood. Whether this is real and what causes it is still under investigation. If it is indeed proven to exist, while it does not constitute a real network loop, spanning tree and loop prevention protocols could easily be triggered by this.', 'comments': ['The TP-link 16 Port TL-SG1016D **does not** work for ethernet backhaul.', 'You can add Zyxel GS2220-10 :-) It works well with VLANs.', 'Netgear GSS108EPP and GSS116E working for wired backhaul for me with Deco M4s\\n\\nPreviously had working fine through a Cisco 2960 Catalyst switch as well, but this stopped working.

However, there is no direct evidence linking the seller \"zachi\" to any fraudulent activity, and no specific information about this seller's reputation. There is no concrete evidence from the actions taken to classify the website as a definite scam. The WHOIS data appears legitimate, and there aren't any red flags from the text content. Moreover, there are no overt signs of scam characteristics based on the information obtained, such as unrealistic money claims or targeting psychological weaknesses, and there is no evidence of complaints or bad reviews.
