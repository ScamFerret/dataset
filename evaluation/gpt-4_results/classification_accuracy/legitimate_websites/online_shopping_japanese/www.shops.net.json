Much has been written about his once friend [Jeremy Hambly](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/sw9q7l/magic_the_gathering_the_downfall_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) seen [here](https://archive.fo/YL3yz) hanging out together in of an anime convention that Desolator was banned from (more on that later), nothing has been written about perhaps the most infamous whiner in magic history. I’m here to fix that. Strap in, because it’s going to get *wild*. Let’s begin. \\n\\n\\n**Humble Beginnings**\\n\\nThough Des’ internet life extends farther than his Magic the Gathering notoriety, that’s a post for another time. He started posting on various message boards under the pseudonym “Desolator114” around 2006, and made his YouTube channel the same year. He remained rather quiet for the next ten years, besides from the occasional ruckus on random forums, but in 2016 he decides to start producing content based around Magic: the Gathering. \\n\\n\\n **Rise**\\nIn all honesty, most of the rules of magic are irrelevant to this, because it’s his attitude and actions that really are the stars of the show. Therefore I won’t be going over them in detail, but I will be mentioning certain rules, so if you would like to know more I suggest you peruse the various other threads on the sub related to MtG. \\n\\nDesolator’s early content is rather mundane. It’s around this time that the big magic YouTubers of today got their starts, such as Tolerian Academy, SafronOlive, The Command Zone, etc. Desator’s original content is similar in style and scope to these other creators, with several of his series like  [MtG mistakes](https://youtu.be/SMuIezbw_F0) and [Weirdest cards ever printed](https://youtu.be/p7Ji-sLSDtQ) gathering respectable amounts of views. He also covered the MtG news of the day, and did unboxings. Nothing out of the ordinary aside from some questionable opinions about cards (most famously claiming Cryptolith Rite, a card which saw no competitive play in almost any format, was going to break the game) and the odd political jab. But, this was merely a sign of what was to come.\\n\\n\\n**Aether Revolt**\\n\\nMagic the gathering releases in sets, and one of them was [Aether Revolt](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Aether_Revolt). Released on January 20, 2017, Aether Revolt was the second set in the Kaladesh block, blocks being made up of several sets that told a continuous story, usually released sequentially. It was generally well received and sold decently, but it drove one man to insanity: Desolatormagic. \\n\\nYou see, Desolator had been buying sets in bulk to try to resell cards for the previous two sets, due to these potentially containing ultra rare cards that would fetch a pretty penny. Unfortunately for desolator, this meant that a lot of product was opened. His gamble had put a serious strain on his finances, and with the release of Aether Revolt, he became irate at Wizards of the Coast (the company that makes mtg) for [not making cards powerful enough to be expensive on the secondary market](https://youtu.be/dnRwVzj9GiI). He would begin to make [video](https://youtu.be/PGVCge4I_5c) after [video](https://youtu.be/YdgwOhs8nUo) lambasting the set for a myriad of contradictory reasons. One day it was too powerful and would kill the game, the next it wasn’t powerful enough and would kill the game. He urged his audience to boycott the set and claimed he was doing so too. [Naturally this didn’t last long.](https://youtu.be/P0SrDMHUCy8) He bought no less than [four boxes on release](https://youtu.be/5sLmeWSY-aM). When fans called him out, his response was he had “orders to fill for his customers.” Which brings us to the next point.\\n\\n**Schrodinger’s Store**\\n\\nOn numerous occasions, Daddy Des has claimed to own a game store where he lives in Wisconsin. Trouble is, nobody has ever seen it, set foot in it, or backed up this claim. He would constantly reference owning a gaming store, but would never actually show any footage, link an address, or even link an online store. There is some evidence to say he owned a computer repair store for a while, but Des kept justifying buying product to his audience by saying he had orders to fill. To this day not a single person has come forward claiming to have bought cards from him in a commercial capacity. It is doubtful any such store exists. \\n\\n**Le Epic Face**\\n\\nThe first thing that strikes anyone looking at Desolator Magic’s content is the [dated references](https://youtu.be/UoRgT75aWaY) [everywhere](https://youtu.be/oxr8Jj8K9Ec). The epic face, the troll face, one image of a hammer, appear all over, poorly photoshopped into magic backgrounds and onto people. This has been happening since 2016, with laziness getting more and more apparent each passing year. Where other content creators like The Mana Leek or Spice8rack have constantly and consistently improved their content and their hardware year after year, Des still uses his terrible old camera, the same microphone, and the same thumbnails. His excuses are myriad, from blaming YouTube for hiding his videos to claiming his store took up too much of his income to invest into the channel.\\n\\nThe thumbnails are not the only dated thing about his content. There’s also extremely dated gamer-gate-esq jokes and rants filled to the brim with racism and misogyny! Much like his friend, the Quartering, Desolatormagic thinks “SJWs” are ruining magic by “forcing their views” onto humble gamers such as himself. Constantly he uses thumbnails that include big red or other symbols of the usual anti-sjw types designed to “trigger the libs”. [He’s claimed the inclusion of an Indian character is affirmative action](https://youtu.be/WvNyGyEDrOI). He’s harassed [people on Twitter who don’t like his opinions.](https://youtu.be/q7K4iZKT1j0)  He’s been banned from twitter. All while constantly complaining about being censored by his haters and deleting negative comments on his videos. \\n\\n**Netdeckers and Their crimes Against Humanity**\\n\\nIf there’s one thing that Desolator hates more than pesky SJWs, it’s [Netdeckers](https://youtu.be/sAxVRmezdjg). What is a Netdecker, you ask? Put simply, it’s someone who gets the decks they play from a list online, usually from lists played at tournaments, rather than constructing something on their own. Astute readers may point out that practically all pro magic players use decks made by others to play and win, and this is correct. Netdecking is only really a problem in kitchen table magic with friends. After all, who wants to face a deck that can kill you on turn two with your budget homebrew? \\n\\nBut, Des isn’t talking about kitchen table magic. He claims that it’s unfair at the pro scene. [He also claims that everything wrong with magic stems from them.](https://youtu.be/UPB-TCYVDdc?si=Jw4fi60pftzt9mLf) This is laughable as nearly everyone at the highest levels of magic don’t use decks they designed. The complexity and scope of pro players decks practically requires online brainstorming to ensure success. It’s akin to being angry at your pro chess opponent because they used an opening they learned and not something they made up. His advice to win competitive Magic is to “bring a random deck that has an adantage over your opponent”, which is so arbitrary it might as well be useless. It also requires some knowledge of your opponent’s decks, which might be found online, so it’s self defeating.\\n\\n [He complained so much that YouTubers began mocking him by posting Supercuts of him saying ‘Netdecker’ over and over again.](https://youtu.be/sAxVRmezdjg?si=nI0SYSAGvmvCvRHh) He responded by saying he hoped the YouTuber dropped dead. \\n\\nThis would not be the last of Desolator’s erratic and dangerous behavior, in fact, it was only the beginning.\\n\\n**Guns and Anime**\\n\\nDesolator, like any red-blooded American patriot, has a thing for guns. [He has a collection almost as big as his Magic one!](https://youtu.be/3RV2UzxtsJ0?si=xV2-3jqM6wuzmKS_) He even sometimes combines his hobbies by shooting [Magic cards for fun.](https://youtu.be/9-rpQMYe-y4?si=gyGvAs6vMVV9aAWv) \\n\\nDesolator also (unsurprisingly) likes anime, but his attempt to combine guns with anime were less well received than his videos of him firing at cardboard. [In 2017, he was banned from the Green Bay based anime con Kitsune Kon due to weapons concerns.](http://www.nerdandtie.com/2017/07/13/kitsune-kon-bans-youtuber-desolatormagic-due-to-weapons-concerns/) In an unhinged [video](https://youtu.be/F6Mnnx7CTAg?t=6m31s), he worries that because of “the sheer volume of threats I get on Twitter and on Youtube and Reddit and everywhere else — if you so much as look at me wrong, I’m probably going to stab you. So just FYI — you might not want to freak me out. You might want to come at me within my full vision arc and kind of slowly. That said, if you do want to fight me, just announce it first. No cheap shots, or I will shoot you.” He also claimed he wanted to wear a bulletproof vest of type IIIa body armor to the con because his “haters” might try to kill him. You know, very normal and sane things to worry about! \\n\\nKitsune Kon, to their credit, almost immediately caught wind of this and banned him. \\n\\nDes didn’t take this lightly. [He posted a screed against Kitsune Kon and urged his followers to boycott the con and email staff their protests.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xOoWAFz3diM) When called out in the comments for not reading the cosplay and prop rules that the convention has had since 2006, he claimed, “Why would I look at the cosplaying rules if I’m not cosplaying?” To him, he believes his guns are needed in case of a terrorist attack. He then describes how he brandished a gun at someone while playing Pokémon Go. He said, “I pulled out a gun to stop someone following me at a high rate of speed in a dark alley and attempting to attack or rob me while playing Pokemon Go.” Whether this mystery assailant was actually malicious or not is anyone’s guess. \\n\\nWhen small nerd and geek news outlets covered the story, Desolator got even more mad. He took to the comment section to threaten to sue Nerd and Tie and defend his honor. He claimed the weapons policy section was not easy to find, he claimed his threats were jokes, and even had his “fans” (debatable on if it was a desolater sock puppet) berate the author for publishing the city he lived in. This lawsuit never materialized. \\n\\nHe further antagonized Kitsune Kon by [standing outside the KI Convention Center in Green Bay with his buddy The Quartering](https://archive.fo/YL3yz), but nothing more came from this incident.\\n\\n\\n**A new challenger approaches**\\n\\nAll this time, Desolator’s antics did not go unnoticed. [His toxicity was well documented during all of this by Magic players,](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/50k71n/we_need_to_talk_about_desolatormagic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) but one group would truly get under his skin and turn him into a meme. \\n\\nEnter r/magicthecirclejerking.\\n\\nMTCJ, as it’s more commonly known, is what the title suggests; it is the circlejerking subreddit for Magic the Gathering. Circlejerk subreddits and their cultures on the whole are a subject for another time, but essentially they are joke subreddits made to mock fandoms and subreddits. Users act like the most unhinged, psychotic, and stupid individuals in a community as a form of satire. The name ‘circlejerk’ itself comes from the pejorative mocking how many conversations on reddit are little more than self aggrandizing, self congratulatory, and masturbatory drivel, not unlike a bunch of men jerking each other off in a circle.\\n\\n They do a myriad of jerks. [They have a bottom 5 custom cards of the week from the r/custommagic subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicthecirclejerking/comments/stkkw2/bottom_5_scoring_submissions_of_the_week_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)[They made fun of the Pinkertons being used by WOTC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicthecirclejerking/comments/1300dm9/being_discriminated_as_a_pinkerton_at_my_lgs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) And of course, they mocked [Daddy Des](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicthecirclejerking/wiki/desolatormagic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). \\n\\n**Negates your Revel in Riches**\\n\\nThis all came to a head in 2018, wherein the set Ixalan was released. There are 2 cards that are important here: Revel in Riches, and Negate. [Revel in Riches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=435271) is a quite unique card in that it has an alternative win condition. Alternative win conditions in Magic always spark discussion as they make for interesting combo decks. Revel in Riches had the relatively easy condition of requiring 10 treasure tokens on your upkeep to win, with the enchantment even incidentally making some treasure tokens when your opponents creatures died. While on the surface this seems like a busted card, it was too expensive and slow to make most combo decks and ultimately saw little competitive play. [That didn’t stop Desolator from proclaiming the end of the world.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jKnY8fhtnlQ) \\n\\nWith his belief this card was busted, Desolator set out to make the perfect deck. He decided to test it on the popular free bootleg unlicensed online magic simulator Xmage. Normally, he would record his videos against bots as proof of his superior deck building (not recommended if you actually care about making a good deck and winning tournaments) but this time he decided to play against players. This was a mistake he would live to regret. \\n\\nBecause his opponent was a member of MTCJ.\\n\\nThis brings us to our next card, [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=491701). Negate is a big standard counterspell printed virtually every set for balance reasons. It counters any non-creature spell for the low low cost of 2 mana. It’s not particularly powerful but can be useful in the sideboard to disrupt your opponent’s win condition, like, say, a Revel in Riches.\\n\\nOn May 2, 2018, user u/sn00giep00 posted on r/MTCJ his interaction with [DesolatorMagic on Xmage.](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicthecirclejerking/s/eMtQ1yt3Ql) In this screenshot, Des is whining that his win condition got countered by a card that “literally does nothing” and that he is tired of “[people] taking… forever and… running toxic turn 40 shit” (you can see it’s turn 13 in the screenshot). He also accuses the player of being an asshole because he is playing a “100% control deck” (he was not). This is not in and of itself particularly noteworthy, his whole channel is full of meltdowns, but what happened next took things to a whole new hilarious level.\\n\\n[EDIT: this section is slightly inaccurate, as u/sn00giep00 chimed in the comment section to say: I\\'d like to clarify something--I wasn\\'t the person Des played on Xmage that day (although I did play him another time and he got just as pissy at me for playing a combo deck of my own.) I found the pic on either Imgur or Twitter, thought it was funny, and posted it on MTCJ. I never expected the whole thing to blow up like it did and for a meme to come out of it.]\\n\\n\\nDesolator magic decided enough was enough and tried to defend himself on r/magicthecirclejerking. \\n\\n**Before This Gets Deleted by the Reddit Admins**\\n\\nIn a post that is now a Copypasta, Des tried to make his case\\n\\n> Before this gets deleted by reddit admins, this asshole took it completely out of context. First of all, the idiot thinks it was a marionette deck. It wasn\\'t. That card\\'s not even in the deck. He was running counterspell draw, this was approximately turn 25, every single creature and spell I cast was countered or removed up until that point and this dumbass who copied his deck from MTG Salvation or Goldfish used one of his last copies of negate to counter a Revel in Riches when he had 0 creatures on the field and I had 0 treasures in play, thus the \"this spell does literally nothing\" and he should have let it resolve. I love it when people copy a deck and have no idea how to run it or play MTG. I was just throwing it out because I had 5 mana and it was the only card left in my hand and the game was already over anyway. So on the way out I let him know what an idiot he was for countering a spell that does nothing in the current board state.\\n\\n>NOBODY wants to watch a recording of a game where I cast something and he counters it or removes it x30 turns. That\\'s idiotic. I should have left the game the second I saw what he was running. This was the 5th attempt at getting a recording of something resembling watchable MTG gameplay and 5 people in a row were playing Karn draw control loop or free cast torrential graveyard resurrection control or approach control loop. So yeah, I was pissed and he was an asshole for playing this. He\\'s one of those idiots who doesn\\'t care about the other players one bit, it\\'s all about winning. So running 35 control spells seems reasonable because NOTHING matters but winning. Thanks for not showing the board state with library counts or the full log, asshole. Enjoy your temporary ban from reddit.\\n\\n**Aftermath**\\nThe post was an instant classic, [with memes almost immediately appearing in its aftermath](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicthecirclejerking/s/gkaobuo4W3). To this day you can’t look up negate and revel in riches without seeing the Copypasta. Some people responded to desolator earnestly in the comments, but he was banned from the subreddit before he could respond. \\n\\nNaturally, Desolator took this mockery in stride and used this experience to humble himself, right? Wrong! [He posted another rant in which he declared war on the subreddit and stated he wanted his followers to get his detractors banned off every social media platform.](https://youtu.be/bIGvmME0Iwg?si=iV3XKZnwbJf2fQKl) \\n\\nAgain, this backfired as now r/MTCJ had even MORE ammunition to mock him with. Memes showing the ‘[desolator army’](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicthecirclejerking/s/g7dUTcNNHf) cropped up, and the jerking continued. \\n\\nSadly, this is the end of the Desolator story. He posted more videos being mad, was mocked some more, and got more mad. He’s faded into obscurity now, but will always live in infamy among the Magic the Gathering community.\\n\\n**Where is he Now?**\\n\\nDaddy Des is still doing YouTube, and still uploading an insane amount of videos with [insane takes](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicthecirclejerking/s/cZZS5uRHTT). He’s been involved in more drama but nothing really important or interesting or funny enough to be included here. I’d be unsurprised if he found this post and gets mad, (in which case hi Des!) but in all honesty I think his craziest days are over. He’s perpetually stuck in 2016 and rarely gets over 5k views on a video. He’s slipped into irrelevance, only with the occasional outburst drawing the mockery of r/magicthecirclejerking. \\n\\nA sad fate for perhaps the most mocked man to ever play Magic the Gathering.', 'comments': ['Reading this, I was surprised I hadn\\'t heard of him, until I got towards the end.\\n\\n\"Ohh, he\\'s the Negate guy, lmao\"', '\"I played Revel in Riches for no particular reason, which was good and reasonable of me. My opponent playing Negate for no particular reason, which was bad and unreasonable of him.\" 🤦', 'I misread the last sentence as “A sad fate for perhaps the most mocked man ever is to play Magic the Gathering” which… fair.', 'Having watched his videos in the past… yeah idk why I did that he was a nut even then. Shame he couldn’t grow beyond the cringiness of his past to be a better person now. Only person worse than him is “MtgHeadqaurters” otherwise known as TheQuartering', 'Probably not the most awful guy connected to Magic, though. For that, I’ll put forward my former WotC UK colleague [Carl Crook](https://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/11669040.paedophile-carl-crook-from-honiton-in-devon-jailed-for-abusing-girl-in-thame-and-high-wycombe/) who, before his conviction, worked as head of Magic in the UK, running most major tournaments here. \\n\\nNobody suspected a thing, but equally nobody was surprised when the news came out.']}]"
