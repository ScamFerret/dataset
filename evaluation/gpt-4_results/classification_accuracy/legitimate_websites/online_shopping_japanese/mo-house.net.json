I am by no means saying this is the ONLY way or that this was a perfect way (indeed I made a lot of mistakes along the way). However, right before I first started, I had no idea what was possible/realistic, so I read stories of other redditors in this sub. It helped a ton in setting an initial path forward- so hopefully this helps somebody too!\\n\\n**2021 stats when I started:**\\n\\n* \\\\# of rentals = 0\\n* W2 dayjob = $98k/yr\\n\\n**2023 stats now:**\\n\\n* \\\\# of rentals = 9\\n* Market value of rental portfolio = \\\\~ $2M\\n* Equity in portfolio = \\\\~$400K (\\\\~ 20%)\\n* Annual rental revenue= \\\\~$300k/yr\\n* W2 dayjob = $185k/yr\\n\\nIt\\'s been a good 2 years for me. I feel its also very important to set the context: when I started I was living in a VHCOL area (San Francisco, California). I actually MOVED to get started- all my rentals are in MCOL areas (Las Vegas, Alaska, Florida.) Also when I started I was 31. I was debt-free, kids-free, unmarried, and had a good job. I owner-occupied all of my rentals at the beginning. If I were to summarize my path, it is this: \\n\\n1. I bought as much house as i could possibly be qualified for (multi-families) with as little down payment as possible\\n2. I added value to all of them (small rehabs that i hired out)\\n3. I then house-hacked each of them (rented the empty units out, rented my own unit out if i wasn\\'t in town)\\n4. I moved and repeated the process (bought other multifamilies)\\n5. Finally I switched rental terms to squeeze as many dollars as possible (went long term -> mid-term rentals)\\n\\n**My initial plan**  \\nSince initially, I had zero idea of what was possible/doable, I came to this sub to read stories of other investors. After reading a few, I settled on this first goal: my goal was to get to \\\\~30 rentals in 5 years. I was hoping this would net me $120k/yr in PROFIT (\\\\~$300/rental.) Since my only source of capital was my day job (immigrant family so no money there), I would leverage my day job to get as high a salary as possible. I\\'d live on the bare minimum and save the rest. Then I would take the entirety of those savings and buy a new property. I would rinse and repeat. This was the plan. \\n\\n**How plan changed and what actually ended up happening**  \\nFirst purchase was a fourplex. At the time I (amazingly) qualified for a state down payment assistance grant. I got the grant and ended up buying a $420k fourplex with an FHA and an astonishingly-low down payment of $2,100 out of pocket. \\n\\nFourplex was shit. Each unit rented for $700/mo. Old and full of cockroaches. Trash everywhere. I kicked everybody out, then went on to rehab the place. I paid for the rehab out of pocket with my monthly salary. After that, I raised rents and found new tenants: new rents $1,050/mo. A year later, rents went up further to $1,200/mo. I kept 2 units as mid-term furnished rentals at $1,800/mo. **So after a year, we had rents of $1,200 + $1,200 + $1,800 + $1,800 = \\\\~$6,000/mo on a property with a $2,500 mortgage (includ. insurance and tax). Cash flowing.** \\n\\nIn my taxes, I wrote of all of my expenses for the rehab and got a fat tax discount.\\n\\nSecond property was a triplex. I moved more than 100 miles and qualified for a second FHA. I had to pay the full 3.5% this time so the down payment was much higher. Between down payment and closing costs, I spend about $40k. I bought my second property 1 year after i had closed on the first property. Second property was MUCH nicer but rents didn\\'t make the mortgage. Rents were $1,650/mo/each. Mortgage for all 3 combined was $5,000. But tenants were month-to-month. I raised all rents to $2,000/mo and gave the tenants plenty of heads up knowing they would leave. As they left, I turned those units into furnished units. I then changed the rentals from long-term to corporate housing, specializing in families who were just moving into town and/or insurance payouts. The new corporate rents were $2,500/mo/each for the low season (8 months), $7,000/mo/each for the high season (4 months.) **Second property now makes annual rental revenue of $130-150k/yr on an annual mortgage of $60k (includ. taxes and insurance). Cash flowing.** \\n\\nThe third property was a single family home (SFH). Really, I wanted a duplex but didn\\'t have the 15% down that required. So instead, I looked for a SFH I could convert easily. I found the perfect fit in a massive house (3,500 sq ft) that had actually already been converted: the original house had 1,500 sq ft, then the old owner had added an extension in the back for another 2,000 sq. ft. This made the conversion super easy: just added a wall in the middle of the original extension. Conversion however, was still very expensive: the now second unit needed a kitchen, which meant new plumbing and new electrical. All in, maybe $50k in rehab costs. I then turned the new \"front\" unit into a furnished corporate rental: $4,000/mo. The mortgage for the whole thing (both units) was $5,000/mo, so the front house alone paid for almost the entire mortgage (w/ insurance and tax.) The back house was bigger and commanded $5,000/mo. At around this time my boyfriend bought a house in another state (his work requires him to move): whenever I\\'m with my boyfriend, I rent out the back unit as a furnished rental: these two units are very new so numbers aren\\'t too historical yet, but it\\'s looking like between the front unit and the back unit, **the house will be bringing in \\\\~ $9,000/mo on a $5,000 mortgage. Cash flowing.**\\n\\n***So overall I\\'m at 9 rentals, overall rental revenue is about $300k/yr on $150k/yr in mortgages. Definitely cash flowing and well over my initial target of $300 profit/rental.*** \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**What I learned/some hard lessons/mistakes I made**\\n\\n* **Lean into what YOU CAN do. Be Opportunistic.** It\\'s easy to focus on what you don\\'t have. Focus instead on what you CAN DO. In my case, I\\'m a 5\"1 woman. I cannot physically do a rehab on my own, so flipping wasn\\'t for me. I never considered it. What I DID have was a remote job in tech: that meant I could get a nice salary and move wherever I wanted. *To get started, I leveraged my ability to move.* I also learned I\\'m a great decorator! I focused on this for pivoting into the much-more lucrative corporate rental market.\\n* **Things will cost 2x as much, and take 3x as long.** Every time. Every rehab. Contractor says 20k, it\\'ll be 40k. 2 months, it\\'ll be 4 months. *Build it into your budget and expectations.* In my case, my boyfriend works construction and literally builds buildings for a living- this has been tremendously helpful for me in seeing in how many ways things can go wrong and how even a $20M project can be backed up for MONTHS. \\n* **Build a reliable team of people around you**. My cleaners for my furnished rentals are my absolute superstars. They are the ones who see each property the most often. *Treat everyone very well and always tip:* your lawn guy, your snow guy, your roof guy. The plumber, the carpenter, the electrician: skilled labor is HARD to come by. If you find a good plumber that charges fair and you can trust, keep that guy. You will be calling him. A LOT. \\n* **Delegate and know when to FIRE someone.** I went through 5 accountants who couldn\\'t help me- mostly recommendations from my family who were used to dealing with clients bringing in $30k/yr in a shit job. They had no idea what to do with my rentals. No idea what to do with property in different states. No idea what to do with a legitimate LLC. I wasted too much time waiting for someone who didn\\'t have a skillset to \"figure it out.\" Likewise, I had a shit property manager for 2 years that I just fired. He was an idiot the whole time and ended up costing me $10k in lost rents.\\n* **If you need capital focus on what you can do to find that capital.** Most of us here on this Earth are born poor. That\\'s ok. What you need to do is find ANYTHING that will net you money, repeatedly, then use this money to buy ASSETS that will make you more money. I know it sound way easier said than done, but the truth is it\\'s hard to become a real estate investor if you\\'re a social worker making $35k/yr. You simply don\\'t make enough. So develop a skillset that\\'s on demand: HVAC, plumbing, carpentry, accounting, engineering. Whatever you do, make sure it pays WELL. You need money to play with if you want to get started buying property and building a profitable portfolio. \\n* **A supportive partner goes a long way.** Easier said than done, but a romantic partner provides stable emotional (and sometimes financial) support that frees up YOUR mental real estate to think creatively and plan ahead. When I first met my partner 3 years ago, we were both dead broke: exactly $0 net worth and each of us had been unemployed for 6 months. But we both had a marketable skillset and we were both frugal in living. 3 years later, my w2 dayjob brings in $185k/yr in tech, and his w2 dayjob brings in $160k/yr as a carpenter. And that\\'s without counting any of the rental income. Though the rental game so far has been my own endeavor (aka only my money invested) having a supportive partner has been immensely helpful in an infinite number of ways: from using his truck, from having help for heavy physical tasks, his endless knowledge of construction, to just having a meal cooked so I could focus on work, etc, etc. Yes, you can do it on your own, but it sure is easier if there\\'s someone else helping you manage the load of just daily living.  \\n\\nAnyway, this has been long enough. I hope that helps someone who\\'s just starting out. Any questions, I\\'ll be happy to help. Good luck! ', 'comments': ['Where do you list your corporate furnished rentals?
