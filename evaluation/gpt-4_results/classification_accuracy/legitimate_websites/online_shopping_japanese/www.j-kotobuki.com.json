Simple things like seeing how the different pairs of girls interact with each other on the job or seeing how generous Mugi is really starts to show some depth to the characters as well.\\n\\nIf for some reason you miss my big essays, you can find my posts from the 2021 rewatch [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/ownrs6/rewatchspoilers_kon_rewatch_2021_s1e02_instruments/h7h2oh7/) and the 2020 rewatch [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/i2jmy0/rewatchspoilers_kon_rewatch_2020_s1e02_instruments/g0546fl/).\\n\\n###Song of the Day\\nThis is without a doubt one of my favorite image songs for season one. Not only is it a joy to listen to, but it encapsulates the reason many musicians (myself included) perform music in the first place - to share their emotions and love of music with the world. I think this is best shown in the chorus (which yes, I quoted last year too, but I think it\\'s still very appropriate):\\n\\n> 76 keys, 76 little elves\\n> \\n> Express my feelings\\n> \\n> Even the feelings I can\\'t put into words\\n> \\n> Will become an honest melody\\n> \\n> In the ears of people who have heard it\\n> \\n> In the hearts of people who have felt it\\n> \\n> With a magic that leaves behind something warm\\n\\n###Questions of the Day\\n\\n1. I\\'ve been playing piano since I was 8 and the French horn since I was 11. I\\'ve been very lucky to have gone to university for music and to be making my living performing (pretty much entirely on the horn - I mostly dropped piano once I left high school).\\n\\n2. I think the lyrics demonstrate Mugi\\'s warmth and caring personality. She has a lot of feelings, but isn\\'t always sure how to \"fit in\" with the rest of the group. Music allows her to connect with everyone else without feeling out of place, I think.\\n\\n###Visual of the Day\\n\\nAnother hard choice! My first thought was what I think is maybe the most obvious one - [the Budokan](https://imgur.com/QjAYCXV)! I love how out of place and over-the-top the art style is here, and it\\'s such a wonderful thing for the girls to strive for. But I decided against using that one since I\\'m almost positive that someone else will pick it.\\n\\nI also briefly considered picking [this shot](https://imgur.com/gE8W66v) of Mugi\\'s all-powerful eyebrows, but ultimately, I chose [this one](https://imgur.com/f8xsYGW) because KyoAni consistently go out of their way to create adorable and unique outfits for all the girls throughout the series.\\n\\n###Totally Canon Mitsu Moment of the Day\\n\\nI love [this moment](https://imgur.com/sUBUIaG) between Ritsu and Mio. Ritsu is the only one that picks up on how uncomfortable Mio is with the idea of having to pick up jobs that involve working with customers, and quickly steers the conversation towards other options. It just goes to show how strong the connection between them is.\\n\\nRunner up goes to [this shot](https://imgur.com/CqUzh0N) of them lying on the blanket together because it\\'s adorable :)\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn tomorrow\\'s episode, let the procrastination begin!! See you all then!', \"**First Timer - Sub**\\n\\nOpening thoughts on the ep: Holy shit that's an expensive guitar to get for your first guitar! I actually punched the currency into Google and it came out just over $1700 USD. For reference, I paid about $1500 for a Les Paul in 2004. In 2009 when K-ON! first came out I'd imagine it was valued over two grand. Unreal. Thankfully blonde girl bails her out and gets it for 50k yen, around $350 USD, which is much more reasonable for a first guitar... if you aren't going for the cheap Strat like I did when I started playing back in High School. Sunburst Les Paul is a dank first guitar, and she loves it so much she doesn't want to touch it! Cute. Gonna be a cute Jimmy Page here in a few episodes.  \\n\\nAlso we get a glimpse of more of the personality of the other girls. Drummer is kinda the stereotypical meathead drummer, but in a good way. Bassist girl is incredibly shy, but is willing to put that aside to help her buy a guitar. Love her the most so far. Also her flashback to picking out her bass and falling in love right away in the same way was iconic, but she lies and says she took her time picking it out. She knew what she wanted in the same way. Keyboard girl is, and I think someone else made this comment yesterday, a lonely rich girl. Extremely grounded, she seems like the one who is most aware of what is going on around her at all times. \\n\\nQotD 1: I mentioned yesterday that I picked up guitar in High School, and I also played flute in Elementary. I got kinda good as I got into college and then stopped playing around my senior year when school was getting a lot tougher and I had a lot less time for things. Def met a lot of interesting people through music, though. Everyone I knew played and many in a band. Fewer still got some gigs and were able to make money playing music live at local bars. This was probably around the same time K-ON! originally aired, and music culture in the area I went to college in hasn't changed much since then. I still keep in touch with some people, and others are just distant memories. Good and bad. \\n\\nQotD 2: Really seems like she prefers to express herself through music. Also probably into girls, mostly. \\n\\nFavorite scene: When guitar girl gave all the checks back to her friends. She knew she just couldn't accept it. Doesn't seem like their friendship is at that level yet, but also I think the guilt might have consumed her as well. Seems like the sort of person who could never take from her friends something she couldn't give back in one way or another. Most heartfelt moment of the show so far for me. Extremely proud of her maturity and character to be able to do that. Also for the girls who so eagerly handed them over without a second thought. I think they'll all be really good friends. \\n\\nFinal thoughts: Things have really picked up since the first episode. We're getting to know everyone on a much better level.\", \"**First Timer - Sub** \\n\\nYep. Yui is a *total* airhead. At least she's adorable? xD Also, blonde keyboardist confirmed for sheltered rich girl. \\n\\nWow, um...are you sure some of the stuff in your piggy bank are even coins, Yui? They don't all *look* like coins...and how the hell did you convince your mother to give you $500? For that matter, why are they discussing the prices in USD instead of yen? \\n\\nTotally don't blame Yui for stopping to fuss over the dog, though. And it turns out her airheadedness is infectious! Good thing *one* of the girls remembered what they're supposed to be doing... \\n\\nAlso, I want to be surprised about drummer girl making the salesman cry...but I'm really not. Also also, I am unsurprised about Yui's little sister being the more reliable one of the pair. \\n\\n...rich girl's family just happens to own the music shop. xD *Why, writers? WHY?* At least Yui can stop looking a kicked puppy now!\\n\\nHonestly, this was a fun little episode. Although I don't think I'd forgive drummer girl for stealing the pleasure of properly unwrapping a new instrument quite so fast as Yui did. Not that I can *play* one...\", \"**First Timer - Sub**\\n\\nA very enjoyable episode for #2! It's very fun to see how much these girls already care about each other this soon into their relationships. I mean, how common would it be for someone to take up a part time job to help a friend buy a guitar? Maybe I'm jaded, but I really like seeing that level of friendship. Mio is quickly becoming [my favorite character](https://imgur.com/0M5L1Pn), although Yui is [a close second](https://imgur.com/yo5c6z7).\\n\\n1. Like I said yesterday, I played the trumpet in high school, but I started in middle school band, so I had 7 years in total. I played violin for 3 years at the end of elementary/start of middle school, and I took piano lessons from kindergarten through around 4th grade. When I started 7th grade, I had to choose between orchestra and band, because we only were allowed a set number of electives, so I dropped violin in favor of trumpet, and frankly, I was glad I did. Wound up as a section leader in high school and was first chair in concert season.\\n2. For me, the lyrics of Mugi's song demonstrate why she is passionate about her music; it's a way for her to handle the stress and longing of dealing with the real world, things you want but can't have, things you wish you could've unsaid. Plus, it also shows how she wants to bring this feeling to other people and share in what she loves. She cares for her friends and she knows that friendship isn't always easy, but she is more than willing to work hard at what she thinks is important.\\n\\nAlthough the two images I linked above are great options, [I think this frame](https://imgur.com/NQxBNh0) says a lot about what to expect from not just Yui and Ritsu, but also the sense of humor this show will bring. Can't wait for next episode!\", '**First timer (subbed)**\\n\\nMan, shoutout to Yui\\'s mom for just giving her 50,000 yen right up front. I wonder if Yui was honest with her mom when she said what the money was for. Maybe she said \"it\\'s for my club\" and mom was so proud of Yui for finally joining a club that she just took out her wallet.\\n\\nSpeaking of Yui\\'s mom, we get to see her! And she looks just like Yui.\\n\\nI REALLY wanted to see Yui try out other guitar models before she settled on the Les Paul. I bet she would look so cool with a Flying V.\\n\\nThe *baito* they do is...interesting. I have a feeling we\\'re gonna have \"Mugi does something because she wants to know what \\'the poors\\' do\" as a recurring gag, which I\\'m cool with.\\n\\nAnd it just ends with Mugi doing another imitation of the \"poors\" and haggling down the price of the Les Paul from 250 to 50. She drives a hard bargain. Interesting that the clerk knows she\\'s the daughter of the president of the company. I would think random low-level clerks wouldn\\'t know who the president of the company is. Imagine a random WalMart employee being able to pick out one of the Walton grandkids. Am I reading too much into this? Probably.\\n\\nYui screwing around with the guitar in her room was so cute. Favorite scene thus far.\\n\\nAnd I totally expected Yui to be utter trash at playing the guitar at first for the comedy, but they didn\\'t go that route. Sure, she\\'s doing the bare minimum with the guitar, but it\\'s good to know they didn\\'t go with the easy joke.\\n\\nDon\\'t tell me that the \"X days until the Budokan show\" is gonna be a regular thing now.\\n\\n#Visual of the Day\\n\\n[They share one braincell](https://i.imgur.com/CImvbgt.png)\\n\\n#Question of the Day\\n>Do you play any instruments? If so, for how long? Feel free to share any interesting stories you may have!\\n\\nGod, I wish. I would pick up the bass if I could muster the motivation to actually learn how to play it. And yes, I want to pick up the bass because I don\\'t want to be the center of attention, just like Mio. **SHE JUST LIKE ME FR**']}, {'title': \"How Japan's league winners almost lost to a high school team in the domestic cup\", 'subreddit': 'soccer', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/8fbgl6/how_japans_league_winners_almost_lost_to_a_high/', 'selftext': \"Hello, /r/soccer. In this thread I'm going to talk to you about what I consider to be one of the most interesting stories in football. It's a shame that this upset was eventually foiled, but still, it's a lovely story. **If you want a TL;DR version, skip to the bottom.**\\n\\nThe Japanese domestic football cup is called the Emperor's Cup. There are two ways to participate in it. First, all the clubs playing in any tier of the J.League (which is fully professional) get a spot. Right now that means the top 3 divisions, but back in 2003, it was just the top 2 instead. The other way is to win a prefectural cup. If you are a club not playing in the J.League, but instead in any of the lower leagues, then you can participate in your prefecture's cup. There are 47 prefectures in total, and the 47 winners get to participate in the Emperor's Cup.\\n\\nHere's the catch. In the prefectural cups, participation is open not to just clubs of that prefecture, but schools as well. As a result, it is not uncommon for university teams to win them, since in some prefectures they are better than any of the semi-pro or amateur clubs around. In very rare cases, even high schools sometimes win the prefectural cup and qualify to the Emperor's Cup. We'll be looking at one such case today.\\n\\nIn November 29 2003, the J.League Division 1 championship, the highest tier of the Japanese league system, ended. Yokohoma F. Marinos were the winners, essentially being declared the best team in Japan. While the Marinos were finishing up their conquest of the league, the first rounds of the 2003-04 Emperor's Cup were taking place. One shock participant was **Funabashi Municipal High School**, which had won the most recent prefectural championship of Chiba and therefore qualified to the Emperor's Cup.\\n\\nIn the first round, Funabashi faced Thespa Kusatsu, a semi-professional club which had just secured promotion to the Japan Football League, then the 3rd tier in the Japanese league system. Funabashi managed to win with a score of 1 - 0. In the second round, they were paired with Hannan University, the winner of the Osaka prefectural championship. Once again, they won with a score of 1 - 0.\\n\\nThe third round was where the J.League Division 1 clubs entered the tournament. As luck would have it, Funabashi got matched against the league winner, Yokohama F. Marinos. The cup match would take place on December 14 2003, just two weeks and a day after Yokohoma won the league. In order words, the strongest team in Japan would literally play against a high school team. There was no way there could possibly be any trouble, right?\\n\\nWell, it didn't seem like it at first. Within 6 minutes, Yokohama was already 2 goals up. However, no further goals were scored, and the teams went into the locker rooms with the score still at 2 - 0. In the second half, Yokohama made more attempts to score, but didn't manage to get a 3rd goal. Then, in the 69th minute, [Yokohama's former international goalkeeper Kenichi Shimokawa fumbled his handling on a cross from a free-kick, allowing Funabashi captain Tatsuya Masushima to lower the deficit](https://youtu.be/UdeW6lCNGq4?t=95).\\n\\nYokohama controlled the game and pushed forward, trying to score another goal and put the result beyond any doubt. However, Funabashi managed to defend. In the 85th minute, a Funabashi counter-attack gave half-Irish player Robert Cullen the ball. [Cullen proceeded to dribble past 3 Yokohama players and then give a nice cross to Kota Tanaka, who scored an easy tap-in](https://youtu.be/UdeW6lCNGq4?t=504). Against all reason, Funabashi had equalized. Less than 2 minutes later, [Funabashi's substitute Toru Kotobuki hit the post with a lob attempt](https://youtu.be/UdeW6lCNGq4?t=585).\\n\\nUnfortunately for Funabashi, [their captain and first scorer Masushima was disgracefully sent off the in the final moments of regular time after performing simulation/diving and receiving a second yellow card](https://youtu.be/UdeW6lCNGq4?t=695). Despite playing with a man down, Funabashi managed to hold out against intense pressure from Yokohama and survive up to the penalty shootout. There, Yokohama goalkeeper Shimokawa saved two penalties while all of Yokohama's takers scored, resulting in a final penalty shooutout score of 4 - 1.\\n\\n**Aftermath:**\\n\\nYokohama F. Marinos would win in the next round with a score of 2 - 1 against \\nSanfrecce Hiroshima, a club which had just ensured its promotion from J.League Division 2 to Division 1. They would lose 4 - 1 in the quarter-finals against fellow Division 1 club Kashima Antlers.\\n\\nFunabashi hasn't qualified to the Emperor's Cup since. However, no other high school team has managed to make it to the 3rd round of the Emperor's Cup after themselves. Many of their players from that match went on to have professional careers. Two of them even represented Japan in the youth levels: captain Tatsuya Masushima and second goal assister Robert Cullen were starters in the 2004 Asian youth championship and the 2005 World youth championship. In addition, Cullen was [reportedly invited to represent the Northern Ireland national side in 2012](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/17111237), but seemingly chose not to.\\n\\nThat's all from me. I'll be glad to answer any questions to the best of my knowledge. Hope this was an enjoyable read!\\n\\n#**TL;DR:**\\n\\nThe best club in Japan needed a penalty shootout to defeat a high school team for a cup match, despite said high school team playing with a man down for the entirety of extra-time.\", 'comments': ['Fantastic read, thanks OP.

At least she got knocked out for it! That being said I definitely wouldn’t wanna be sleeping in the same room as her.\\n\\nAww I love the scene with Yui and Azusa practicing together.

Sure, she makes use of the houses available to her and uses her name to help Yui get a discount on the guitar (after spending a bunch of time saving up money).  She apologizes for the \"small\" home, not as a way to say \"haha, I have bigger vacation homes everywhere\", but more to say she tried for something better for her friends, but didn\\'t fight hard for it.  Also, her friends not knowing she went on vacation to Finland suggests she doesn\\'t want to stuff it down their throats that she\\'s rich AF.  Also, her actions when on the call are adorable.\\n\\n____\\n\\nI saw people mentioning last episode and this one, in regards to the laziness of the group and the \"tone deafness\" of Azu-nyan suggesting that she maybe she was in the wrong for calling out their laziness.  I disagree with that sentiment.   Azu *was* wrong to blurt out in disgust at how unfocused her senpais were being.  And the practice session in this episode is why.  All the goofing off and having fun together is why they play so well together.  Sure, they don\\'t practice a lot, but they really don\\'t need to.  Remember, Yui didn\\'t play anything before and pretty much only joined because she was being offer snacks and tea.  Mio was going to join a book club.  Mugi was trying to join a choir club, and really only joined because she wanted to have fun experiences with clubmembers.  Ritsu is Ritsu.  The Light Music Club is for fun.  Sure they have a \"goal\" in mind, but that\\'s obviously not a hard goal.  This series isn\\'t about them playing music instruments and getting better, it\\'s a show about 5 girls hanging out in their club room and enjoying their teen years the best they can.\\n\\nAlso, it\\'s THEIR club, not Azu\\'s.\\n\\n______\\n\\n[Brief second image shown when Sawa-chan is whacked for being a dirty old man.](https://i.imgur.com/r4vdgEz.jpg)\\n\\n____\\n\\n**Q:** Do you think Azusa is fitting into the group nicely, or not?\\n\\n*Based on the tan, I\\'d say so...*', '**Rewatcher**\\n\\nI always have time for some piano or keyboard, so let\\'s compare the image songs for Mugi, too\\n\\n*Dear My Keys ~Kenban no Mahou~* - Mugi image song #1  \\nWell that\\'s cheerful and fun!

Where others tend to sing more or less first-person, Mugi-as-singer generalises, talking about abstract \"girls\" in the third person: \\n\\n> Girls, you know//Are greedy, myself included  \\nBut their love, dreams//And even friendships are always earnest\\n\\nWhile including herself, albeit at a bit of a distance, she does go straight back to \"their\" immediately after (alright, that\\'s possibly a translation thing only, but I\\'m just gonna go with it). It feels appropriate for Mugi, who sometimes seems to be watching the others from behind the keyboard or tea set - or rolled up magazine binoculars - but not fully involved.\\n\\n*Humming Bird* - Mugi image song #2  \\nI\\'m sorry to say I don\\'t like this one. Musically it seems like an also-ran (to my idiot ears, anyway) and the lyrics also seem like a mishmash of vaguely J-pop-y words. Ah well, can\\'t all be winners.\\n\\n*Sunday Siesta* - Yui image song  \\nAlright that\\'s a *great* title for it. Not just taking a nap, but on a day off! It could only be Yui! *But*, if you step waaaay back and read both words in a broad sense, it\\'s like. \"Taking a break from taking a break.\" Yeah some handwaving but. That\\'s a neat double negative describing exactly how she ended up in the club! What\\'s notable here is the massive use of onomatopaeic (?) words (in the Japanese, ones like \\'kirakira\\' and so forth) and filler sounds. It gives it a very strongly childish vibe, in the least insulting way possible.\\n\\nThat leaves QotD 1 & 2, which I\\'ll combine: Azusa is still... Maybe not *abrasive*, but willing to chastise the others for their lackadaisy ways while still ending up involved in classic I\\'m-not-playing-these-games-because-I-like-them-or-anything fashion. It\\'s fairly pointed out to her that she\\'s being hypocritical when she goes to told-you-so the others, I think. But as the saying goes, hypocrisy is the tribute vice pays to virtue. \\n\\n*S1E10 - Another Training Camp!*  \\nGee Yamada, your mom lets you have *two* beach episodes?', '**First timer (subbed)**\\n\\nIt\\'s training camp time, again! But first, a little Ui and Azusa chat. And Azusa is still under the delusion that they\\'re gonna be doing a lot of practicing in their training camp. Why do I feel that Azusa isn\\'t gonna last long as a club member?\\n\\nTaking a second look at the OP, we see Azusa playing the guitar with her head down. Now I am sad.\\n\\nOoh, Azusa talking shit about Yui to her sister? That\\'s cold.\\n\\nOf course, the senpai Azusa admires the most is Mio. I\\'m still convinced that they\\'re secretly sisters.\\n\\nThen she starts talking shit about Ritsu, and SURPRISE RITSU APPEARANCE! And we need to get Mugi in there somewhere, so let\\'s have Azusa and Ritsu talk about how rich Mugi is. We got everyone? Good.\\n\\nSo Mugi is spending her summer vacation in...Finland? I know they have some very pretty forests, but I was expecting Hawaii considering she turned down that trip to Hawaii a couple of episodes ago.\\n\\nAzusa when Yui talks about buying swimsuits: \"You\\'re gonna goof off and we\\'re gonna get nothing done!\"  \\nAzusa when Mio talks about buying swimsuits: \"Ahh yes, we will be needing breaks. Good call Mio-senpai!\"\\n\\nAnd now we\\'re up to 4 confirmed Mugi houses: the 2 we\\'ve seen, her primary residence, and the one that she\\'s failed to book a stay in for 2 years in a row now.\\n\\nTime to have some fun on the beach! We now know 3 of Azusa\\'s weaknesses: headpats, cake, and insinuating she has no athletic ability. And I liked the bit where after Azusa triggered Mio\\'s fear of barnacles, they have an arrow pointing at her running away from them in every shot they have of the club playing on the beach.\\n\\nNever mind, she has a 4th weakness: the sun! Damn, her skin is the same color as a roasted ham.\\n\\nA quick round of practicing later, and it\\'s time to eat! We\\'ve got cabbage, we\\'ve got Ritsu and Yui crying while chopping onions, we\\'ve got Mio being bullied, we\\'ve got everything! And Azusa\\'s actually enjoying herself, even though the rest of the club isn\\'t practicing. OMG, is she gonna stop insisting on practicing every moment?\\n\\nVery surprised that we haven\\'t had any jokes revolving around the fact that Azusa\\'s skin has been cooked.\\n\\nOh boy, they\\'re sending Mio and Azusa out into the spooky woods at night trying to spook them. But something even more terrifying than a ghost is about to show up: Sawako-sensei!\\n\\nOh look, they finally acknowledged the fact that having a sunburn hurts. Only took half the episode.\\n\\n[I fucking hate her so much get her off of my screen.](https://i.imgur.com/taA5Ax7.png)\\n\\nSleepy time, and Azusa sees Yui practicing her guitar. OMG, they\\'re having a little practice sesh together, that\\'s so cute! And remember earlier in the episode when Azusa said that she didn\\'t like Yui being all touchy? Well, now she\\'s smiling as Yui gives her a big ol\\' hug. We love character development!\\n\\nAnd we bookend the episode with another Azusa-Ui meeting! Except this time, she\\'s listing off the positives of each band member (and Mio\\'s scaredy-catness, of course).\\n\\n#Visual of the Day\\n[Sometimes you need eye protection when you\\'re chopping onions](https://i.imgur.com/HEwUFPJ.png)\\n\\n#Questions of the Day\\n>How does Azusa describe the Keionbu gals? Is it different from Yui\\'s description back in episode 2?\\n\\nUhh\\n\\n*runs back to episode 2 to see what Yui said about the other girls*\\n\\nMio is pretty much the same, Yui has a more positive opinion on Ritsu than Azusa, and Mugi is pretty much the same. I like the thing where she describes all of them negatively (except Mio) in the beginning and describes them all positively (except Mio) in the end.\\n\\n>Do you think Azusa is fitting into the group nicely, or not?\\n\\nNow I would say she is. Sometimes, you just need a little team bonding trip in order to get everyone on the same page, and that\\'s what happened here.', '#K-On Rewatch Episode 10: [Vamos a la Playa! (Part 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-77txuiVXs)\\n\\n##3 Main Points!\\n\\n1\\\\. **The Keionbu is having another training camp, but with Azusa coming along this time!** Azusa is skeptical about the camp, having been exposed to the inner workings of the LMC, but Mio assures her that they’ll get some practice in.\\n\\n2\\\\. Azusa gets more than she bargained for when she is goaded into goofing around with everyone by Ritsu. **Despite wanting to practice, Azusa ends up playing around the most and gets sunburnt!** In addition, she gets exposed to different parts of the girls, like Mio’s fear of scary things and Mugi’s quirky and childlike nature.\\n\\n3\\\\. In the end, Azusa gets to see the hardworking and dedicated side of Yui that wants to get better for the sake of her friends. In a touching scene, Azusa and Yui share a moment and practice the opening riff of a new song together. **Azusa finally relents and admits that she’s really liking the club, despite not getting much practice in!**\\n\\n##Fun Details!\\n\\n- In a funny callback to S1E1, Yui is seen lying on the floor in summer in front of the fan since she doesn’t handle AC too well.\\n\\n- At the beach, Yui and Ritsu pretend to wake up on the island of Zipangu. [“Cipangu”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Japan#Jipangu) is one of the names of Japan, and was first mentioned by Marco Polo in his accounts. Like in the show, Cipangu was thought to have tons of gold and silver because of the volcanic nature of the islands.\\n\\n- Additionally, one of the alternate spellings of Zipangu is “Jipangu”, which is typically thought to be the source of the English name for Japan.\\n\\n- While tuning her guitar, Azusa’s tuner is reading 440 Hz for the A note. [A440](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard)) is a musical pitch corresponding to the A note above middle C being tuned to a frequency of 440 Hz. There is a [conspiracy theory](https://globalnews.ca/news/4194106/440-hz-conspiracy-music/) claiming that A432 (the same A note, but tuned to 432 Hz) is the true tuning of A, and that A440 is being used for nefarious purposes.\\n\\n- While practicing late at night, Yui and Azu-nyan are seen playing the opening riff of (**POTENTIAL SPOILER WARNING**) [a song that was briefly mentioned in S1E8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXESsMP2_vY)!\\n\\n##Other Thoughts!\\n\\n- I love this episode! We get to see the dynamics of the other characters but from the perspective of someone who barely knows them.\\n\\n- Ritsu and Mio were made for each other, and I’m glad the writers thought so too haha\\n\\n- Yui and Azu-nyan are adorable together, it was so cute seeing Azu-nyan finally give in to Yui’s displays of affection, even if she does it a little too much\\n\\n##Questions of the Day!\\n\\n1\\\\. Azu-nyan pretty much hits the nail on the head with each girl. Not much different from the second episode, but it was still fun to see!\\n\\n2\\\\. Azu-nyan is a tough customer for the Keionbu, but she’s fitting in very nicely with her ability to keep everyone grounded while still having fun!\\n\\n3\\\\. The lyrics pretty much tell you what’s going on in Yui’s head at any given moment. She’s a bit scatterbrained, but you can tell she wants to *something*, she’s just not sure what to do.\\n\\nIn terms of Toyosaki Aki’s performance, it’s incredible how good she is at being able to sing difficult songs while still being in character. Yui’s singing voice is very cute, but it’s definitely a little breath-y, almost like she has to “push” each note and phrase out of her mouth. That being said, she also has great range, as we’ll see in other songs!']}, {'title': 'Penac Trendex 0.5mm pencil', 'subreddit': 'mechanicalpencils', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/comments/c9sr5e/penac_trendex_05mm_pencil/', 'selftext': \"Penac pencils don't seem all that common.
