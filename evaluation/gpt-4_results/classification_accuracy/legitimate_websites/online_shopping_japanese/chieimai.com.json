The streaming program works well on laptops and desktops, adequately on tablets, and can be used on phones but it's very much a pain to join the chat on the phone version (and so don't feel you have to chat if you're on a phone). If you wish to join us, you need only click the link and register with an e-mail address (I have never received spam from them) - no subscriptions or syncing is necessary. \\n\\nWe are very casual, and so feel free to drop in on whatever weekends you're interested and available. We generally watch as much as will fit in the 3 hours from 8pm GMT to 11pm GMT, but I do generally ask if the group wishes to continue at that point, and occasionally we push on further. I generally have the room up around 15 minutes before the start time playing various music related to the show so that people can get set up and comfortable\\n\\nWe will be watching the series in order, and with the Japanese soundtracks when available:\\n\\n* Boys x Girls Next Door (98 episodes)\\n* Closing Door\\n* Transit Girls (8 episodes) - the scripted drama that the same production team at East Entertainment made between the movie and B&GITC.\\n* Boys & Girls In The City (46 episodes)\\n* Aloha State (36 episodes)\\n* Opening New Doors (49 episodes)\\n* Tokyo 2019 - 2020 (42 Episodes) - Yes, all of it. We've got to give Ron Monroe her shot.\\n* Shanghai Share Life (30 episodes)\\n\\nWe also are generally watching something after the show each week including other Asian reality shows, dramas, movies and anime. We will definitely watch the movie musical Dance With Me when Maimai leaves the house since everyone enjoyed her performance when we watched it in the 3rd loop.\\n\\nThe drinking game includes drink when:\\n\\n* Seina has wine\\n* Hana (Imai) wears a hat EXCEPT when she wears her Nazi hat at which point you must not drink\\n* Chie has beer\\n* Light Fixture Shot - this is the one perennial that runs through all the series.

        "thought": "The Reddit search did not reveal any direct information or discussion related to \"Chie Imai\" that would suggest that the website or the company is a scam. The search results returned are related to different individuals and do not pertain to the website in question. Given the information I have gathered from the WHOIS data, the longevity of the domain, the lack of concerning content on the website, and the absence of negative social media presence or discussions on Reddit, there are no definitive signs that https://chieimai.com/ is a scam website based on the characteristics provided. However, a lack of evidence does not categorically prove legitimacy, but it does suggest that there are no obvious red flags based on the actions taken. I now know the final answer. Based on the analysis conducted using the ten actions, there is no conclusive evidence suggesting that https://chieimai.com/ is a scam website. The domain has been around for a substantial amount of time, and there were no scam indicators based on the extracted text, hyperlinks, WHOIS information, or social media presence.",
