Kiku is treating Zoro’s  wounds. Kiku uses the word “sessha” instead of I and she’s almost 3  meters tall. Tsuru wants to Tama to eat “Shiruko” but as she doesn’t  have any money, Tama refuses to eat it. Then Tsuru says, if Tama isn’t  going to eat it then she will throw it away.

The now deceased Oden created a huge plantation  and provided everyone in Kuri delicious food. The plantation now belong  to Orochi, and Tsuru and the rest purchase the rotten ingredients from  them. After Tsuru reveals the internal circumstances of Wano, someone  aims an arrow at Tsuru. Zoro blocks the arrow with his katana. The one  who shot the arrow is one of the Gifters who has eaten the bat SMILE and  became a batman. He’s using the wings of a bat and is flying. His  hearing is 6 times greater than an average human, so he wanted to kill  Tsuru who insulted the Shogun. One arrow after another is aimed at  Tsuru, but Zero blocks all of them. As they were distracted by the  batman, another gifter who has eaten the Gazelle SMILE abducts Tama .  And in order to rescue Tama, Kiku takes a katana with her and follows  the gazelleman. Luffy and Zoro go with her. The gazelleman is heading to  the official’s town and Hawkins, Holdem, and Speed as well as 30 other  SMILE users are waiting. Luffy asks who exactly Kiku is, and she  answers, “I (sessha) am a Samurai!”. After Law hears from Bepo that  Luffy and the rest are heading to the official’s town, he says “Hey  wait!

Be aware that even vague comments (“This will become important later on”) can be major spoilers.*\\n\\n**Staff of the day**\\n\\nMadame President is voiced by [Hiromi Tsuru](https://myanimelist.net/people/354/Hiromi_Tsuru), who unfortunately died 3 years ago. Out of her huge list of roles, her biggest for western audiences is probably Bulma from Dragon Ball, although I suspect that in Japan she may be known more for Anpanman’s Dokin-chan. With Madoka Ayukawa (Kimagure Orange Road) she voiced a character that may well have won Best Girl in the early 1990s if /r/anime had been around back then. Meryl Stryfe (Trigun) and Ukyo Kuonji (Ranma ½) are two more characters in series that were hugely popular and if you think that is all not big enough yet, she has minor roles in Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Macross, Samurai Champloo, One Piece, and Yu Gi Oh! Finally, she has one of the very few “western” anime VA roles as Trinity from the Animatrix.\\n\\nThe VA of our Protagonist, Kintaro, is [Mitsuo Iwata](https://myanimelist.net/people/399/Mitsuo_Iwata), who is fortunately still alive (at least he tweeted something this year). Not as prolific as Hiromi Tsuru, most of his roles are support characters, including some rather recent series such as Shirobako, March comes like a lion, and Asobi Asobase (where he voices the baby …). However, he has one main role in a huge hit, probably the most renown non-Ghibli anime film of the last century (and some would say most renown anime film period), Shoutarou Kaneda from Akira.', 'comments': [\"### First Timer\\n\\n## [Iconic Frames of 90's OVAs](https://files.catbox.moe/usmbsb.jpg) Golden Boy Episode 1\\n\\nGolden Boy is a legendary OVA series so I'm glad this rewatch came around to give me a reason to watch it now.\\n\\nFor an OVA series which obviously was designed to sell based on sex appeal I am very impressed with the production quality. Of course I am a bit biased because of how much I love the 80s and 90s anime aesthetic but it really feels they went above and beyond in the animation and art direction.\\n\\nFrom a story perspective I really love Kintarou's dedication. He seems to genuinely care about learning about the world and getting things done. In addition, a lot of ecchi series tend to make jokes and have the plot develop in ways which sexualize the female cast in a demeaning way. I'm glad that (at least so far) Golden Boy has made the women feel powerful in their sexuality, despite Kintarou's prevy behavior.\\n\\nFor this episode in particular, I'm a bit surprised Kintarou picked up programming so quickly. Despite that, it was nice to see that he used the other things he learned to make the software more user friendly. Of course he left before he could be appreciated leaving the company president to realize the mistake she made.\\n\\nAs an aside, this episode showed 1 scene of [actual computer code](https://files.catbox.moe/9gprhx.jpg). I can tell you that this is unfortunately not C, Small Talk, or Assembly like they mentioned ut is instead the Unix shell command language Bash. Bash is pretty limited in its syntax so making anything meaningful will typically require piggybacking off other programs to do most of the work for you. The script in the show seemed to be setting up some environment variables which would be used later when running another application. Anyway, boring programming talk over.\\n\\n## Cool Shot Corner\\n\\nThere were some really well animated shots, here are my favorites:\\n\\n* [Drifting Overtake](https://files.catbox.moe/kdozcj.mp4)\\n* [Reflection and Wind in His Hair](https://files.catbox.moe/osgusx.mp4)\\n* [Swinging Gait](https://files.catbox.moe/8ruqzo.mp4)\\n* [This Cut](https://files.catbox.moe/a9qdlm.mp4)\\n* [Serious Transformation](https://files.catbox.moe/pxfpga.mp4)\\n* [Cycling to Tomorrow](https://files.catbox.moe/3r1i06.mp4)\\n\\nSee you all tomorrow\", 'What an embarrassing start to a rewatch... I just did an episode 1 write up of Golden Time before remembering how that\\'s not the show we\\'re meant to be watching. Let us never speak of this again. \\n\\nMeanwhile on our actual 90\\'s show~ Pfft XD I\\'ve gone dub this time and already am loving my choice. After putting up with the sloppiness of Witchblade\\'s animation this just feels so much more comfortable for my eyes. So we\\'ve got our dorky career part timer which is more relatable that is like aaand op time~ Chill beat tbh. Not much happening in the op itself. Urgh... Okay, I didn\\'t need to see that much trash while I\\'m eating. Flies too? TUMMY SPOTTED!! Omg he\\'s puking too. We needed a warning before this. Wow... Calm your tits.\\n\\nHa! Sucker! You\\'re one day late to make the boys and girls viewing this lose NNN! Does she throw money at everyone she runs off the road? She hit him but that\\'s some pretty wild recoil... \"That was educational.\" Indeed... Just saying Dio\\'s walk would be a lot less scary if he didn\\'t have the *threatening* sound effects visible around him. Oi! You\\'re seriously hiding around the corner Kintaro? Sleezebag!\\n\\nAh, I recognise that car. So many cute ladies. Wow, do you think all tech design companies are like this? I picked the wrong career. They\\'re all so pretty XD Oh, it\\'s boobie lady again. Pfft! I love this. How sleezy is the show gonna get? WHAT!? *Yas my queen!* Eww... Is he gonna sniff the toi-nope! Got his face in it. Gurk... Guuurh.... Aww, boobie lady is actually really cute when you don\\'t have her bizarre outfit in shot. Kintaro seems the type who\\'d just blag his way through any job.\\n\\nAlright, so now he\\'s gonna have to wow a computing company with his hometaught programming skills. Actually he\\'s homeless... Oof... Dammit! Foiled by seabass! I\\'m sure that some techy folk actually get this whole bit. Wait! There are a couple bases you\\'re missing there! First day on the job and you\\'ve already sniffed all the toilets and harassed the female staff. Good job dumass XD The English dub is like a corny student film. It\\'s so quotable too. Now I get why so many people borrow clips from it. Still hadn\\'t seen boobie lady\\'s silly outfit before though. Wait, you\\'re keeping him!? How do you bs your way out of this?\\n\\nDark hair is bae... 4chan? I hope someone\\'s got the translation of these notes. For science! Mingling is a useful life skill folks. Nice, boobie lady has a proper top on now. I hope to god that these tech terms are just filler chat and I won\\'t have to remember them all. Button your shirt woman!! Health and safety was a thing in the 90\\'s! If he falls she\\'s totally liable with her showing off her breasticles at every opportunity. Hiding in the lockers when folks are coming in to change is a new level of stupid. Take the bra off! No, not you girls. Changing clothes is nice...\\n\\nOh my god why!? Check before turning off any pc. And if you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing then don\\'t do it!! You numbskull! You\\'re a waste of electricity! Even if dream sequences her tits are having a rave. Yes, her nickels and dimes have been visible all episode. YOU MONSTER!! That book had all your measurements in it! Oh god, of all pages to open. He spent 10k in a day!?!? Horses, girly clubs, bathtime. Pfft XD Okay, that spit gag was actually pretty funny.\\n\\nYeah, pretty tragic for the girls having to redo all that work. Oh! I know that collapsed girl! I\\'m not even going to comment on boobie lady\\'s clothes anymore... One sleezy, first timer moron outdoes a room full of tech experts in like a week. Okay, so he didn\\'t blow it on everything we saw in the clip. At least I don\\'t have to hate the knob now. \"Finally, I\\'ve met someone else who throws money at people like its going out of style! Is this love?\" Wait, what speed is he going at!?\\n\\nWell that was certainly something... I laughed, I cried, I almost barfed. The show went way more into the sleezy sort of comedy than I was expecting but the toilet scene and boobie lady\\'s ladies having a mind of their own successfully cycled back around to being funny again. The office ladies didn\\'t get quite as much dialogue as I\\'d have liked but each one of them were genuinely lovely each moment they were on screen. I did not get the programming jokes at all but I\\'m sure they were great since they seem to have hit the mark with that particular audience. Long dark hair still best girl.', '**Episode 1 (first timer)**\\n\\nYes, you read that right, the host is a first timer here. I never actually watched Golden Boy. However, doing OVA rewatches without acknowledging the huge role that sex in general and ecchi in particular played for OVAs of that time would be missing a huge part of what the draw of that segment of the market was: Not having to abide by the strict rules of TV broadcasts. You may have noticed in some of the previous OVAs that they play loose with nudity, but I really wanted to include an ecchi show and Golden Boy has the accolades of being one of the best of those from that decade.\\n\\n**Episode thoughts**\\n\\n* Complaining about people singing along with their walkman – *if only you knew what the future has in store for you…*\\n* Hello Kintaro!\\n* Back when doing part-time jobs at 25 was a sign of an easy-going lifestyle and not being destined for a lifetime of insecure jobs.\\n* OP: Instrumental music and mountain biking.\\n* [2020 memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/camera-zooming-on-rosas-breasts) are 25 years late to the party.\\n* In her defense, he literally just sorted through garbage, I would not want to be touched by him either.\\n* That confrontation ended different from what I was expecting.\\n* “Are you some kind of pervert?”\\n\\n[](#laughter)\\n\\n* Basic (basic), C (old school), assembler (hard core), small talk (what the heck is this??)\\n* “Do what you want, but don’t distract the others” – she is going to regret this, right?\\n* “Life is one big mistery” – the advantages of being denser than rock.\\n* */r/whatcouldgowrong/* when I unplug the company server?\\n* */r/whatcouldgowrong/* when I write a program for 3 months without ever saving a backup?\\n* “I can’t believe he did all this in one week” – neither can I.\\n* ED: Sweet music, but just a black screen for visuals.\\n\\nGolden Boy begins with literal trash and embraces the concept fully. Kintaro is like the incarnation of all anime perverts come to life and the show leave absolutely no doubt that it is all about the *plot*, not the plot.\\n\\nUsually, I am not a big fan of the *female punches male* trope, but, boy, is Kintaro punchable. With the kind of shit he pulls, it is hard not to agree with a little violence. That makes the running gag of Kintaro messing up and being beaten a bit more bearable.', '###First Timer\\nI don\\'t really know much about Golden Boy. I think it\\'s a somewhat lewd comedy show?

Ok, they *did* invade some countries, but what do we care about some unnamed backwater?', '**First-timer - Sub**\\n\\nFeeling marginally better, so I thought I’d try to write some today.\\n\\n[*Oh, what, wow.*](https://i.imgur.com/HNGcfyM.png)\\n\\n[Hiccups](https://i.imgur.com/Rj0jnvt.png)\\n\\n[Obvious plot development incoming.](https://i.imgur.com/6vFKkiF.png)\\n\\n[No time for character development —we need to force it!](https://i.imgur.com/olmPe0j.png)\\n\\n[There were mechs in here all along?](https://i.imgur.com/BRlM5zs.png)\\n\\n[You don’t say?](https://i.imgur.com/h56EzYn.png)\\n\\n[Ah, so that’s his special isekai power.](https://i.imgur.com/GwNC98k.png) Explains how he was able to peer into Ifurita’s memories.\\n\\n[Outstanding.](https://i.imgur.com/Tml1qTh.png)\\n\\n[Wait a second, you’re here?](https://i.imgur.com/HsWiyV0.png) How come Nanami hasn’t seen your disguise? \\n\\n[Oh, I spoke too soon.](https://i.imgur.com/qF8Hs0Q.png)\\n\\n[This is happening a lot sooner than I expected.](https://i.imgur.com/Ht4nMWy.png) I thought this would be strictly finale material.\\n\\nAs I suspected, I have absolutely no memory of this, so it seems like yesterday I caught up to where I left off. This was alright. Stuff is moving along, plans are going into motion, and for the most part characters aren’t just sitting around wasting time for no reason. Don’t have much to say beyond that, I just enjoyed it.\\n\\n**Questions:**\\n\\n1) \"Princess Fatora, before your execution I would like to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this superweapon operational.\"\\n\\n2) There\\'s probably plenty I would like more but can\\'t recall at the moment, but I am partial to Unicron for obvious reasons.', '**First-Timer**\\n\\nOh, no! TIE fighters are attacking the city!\\n\\nDance party? Bugs don’t have great moves. Jinnai’s not holding his booze too well, either. Doubt he\\'ll even take a shot at Hot Bug Lady, even though she\\'d totally let him touch her boobs or something.\\n\\nAnother gal dreams of Makoto. So he’s got: a small business genius, a magical girl priestess, a demon god WMD, and a teen (who’s only interested when he’s doing drag). Not the worst harem I’ve seen.\\n\\nActually the only logical way to keep Sensei from his hootch.\\n\\nCatfight leads to the discovery that we’ve been in Laputa all along.\\n\\nMakoto’s power is Hermit ~~Purple~~ Blue.\\n\\nHow is Galus at the castle and doing his devious shit at the same time? Are there multiple Gali, or is everyone at the castle that stupid that they don’t notice this all happening in their basement? The latter would not surprise me, given everything that’s happened.\\n\\nEverything involving Nanami is oddly anti-climactic. She’s dropped off in another part of the world? They meet her selling sandwiches. Galus is hiding something? \"He’s blue.\" Thanks for settling the dramatic irony and leaving us with almost nothing interesting to deal with.\\n\\nQOTD:\\n\\n1) Either it\\'s all been a dream, or El Hazard is somehow the far part or far future of Earth.\\n\\n2) When done right, Galactus from Marvel can be terrifying.', \"Rewatcher(Bits and pieces now.)\\n\\nSub(I was actually wrong, Miz is well past Christmas Cake and is approaching 30)\\n\\nBig recap of last ep because OVA. We then start on the Bugrom having a victory party. There is music and the bugs are dancing, which raises questions. Diva and Katsuhiko are drinking, which raises further questions. Katsuhiko can't handle his alcohol but, you know, he's under aged. Also, Diva is serving him in a manner that suggests she might be looking for fresh genetic material. I've read this doujin before, Katsu, don't do it, you wind up trapped in a time loop!\\n\\nOn the roof, Ifrit is remembering the construction of the Eye of God. And freaking out a bit about Makoto. We pan to her handiwork and get the counsel talking on the next action. We then jump to Fujisawa isolated on a pillar because, apparently, he can't avoid drinking otherwise. F. Also, dear god Miz, going straight into enabling is not a good thing.\\n\\nWe get Makoto back to crossdressing, pondering the weird shit that is his life now. At least this MC tells everyone else about Ifrit. And then Shayla is into Makoto because sure. And of course Makoto has Density(A) and can't see that. Nanami, however, has her creeping senses at max and intervenes. As bitches are about to throwdown, Makoto activates an ancient...combat robot?\\n\\nAnyways, we learn Makoto's superpower: Technomancy. Not a bad one on a world with this much ancient tech. Anyways, he blindly activates something disturbingly mine looking. Jump to the Phantom Tribe who have their tech going and we discover that, apparently, mitochondrial DNA codes the Eye of God. \\n\\nSkip over to Fujisawa escaping right into Shayla. Who then offers him a drink. I get that Nanami got to you but disabling the super soldier just so you don't drink alone is selfish and short sighted. But then she reveals that she is probing Fujisawa for information on Makoto's relationship status. And that she's 19. Which, I could swear, that 19 yos could drink in Japan. Anyways, she gets sexually assaulted by Alliel who drops that the Alliance wants to make a move.\\n\\nThe sages go up to the Eye of God communications platform. Alliel is not loyal. Technomancy happens and their doomsday weapon literally blocks the sun and causes a thunderstorm. And is also in a much lower orbit than I originally thought. Cut to Jinnai having a statue built of himself because that does fit. Ifrit is considering things.\\n\\nCut to the palace where they are feasting mutually assured destruction. Yeah, these guys definitely scavenged this tech. Nanami reveals the obvious about Galus and he is somewhat better as a loud villain than a quiet one. They reveal the crossdressing ruse. Illusion is cast so they escape.\\n\\nIfrit arrives and begins blowing shit up, but not in a hurry. She reveals that Makoto did something that is messing with her. And cliffhanger.\\n\\n2 The Shadow missile cloud from Babylon 5.\"]}]"
