Given the information I have gathered so far, the website does not exhibit the typical characteristics of a scam website. It has been registered for a long time, and the content on the site seems legitimate, promoting medicinal curry products without any clear scam indicators. There is a lack of social media presence, but this is not uncommon for small businesses. WHOIS information indicates a legitimate registrant and contact information aligns with a known hosting provider. I now know the final answer. Based on the available information and the lack of scam indicators, there is no evidence to suggest that http://www.base-camp.jp/ is a scam website.",

            "result": "false",
            "scam_type": "null",
            "reason": "The website has been registered for a significant period does not show typical scam characteristics such as unusually low prices or dubious claims and the WHOIS information indicates a legitimate business. There is no evidence from social media or Reddit searches to suggest that this website is a known scam. Absence of certificate details alone is not sufficient to classify a website as a scam."
