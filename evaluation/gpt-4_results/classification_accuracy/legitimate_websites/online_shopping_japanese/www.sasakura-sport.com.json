I mean yes, it gives us super cool, over the top, exciting shows filled with magic or super powers or giant mecha, that much is probably obvious to anyone, but did you know that there are a lot of shows that also give us insight into the world around us? Believe it or not, there are a whole bunch of shows mostly grounded in reality that showcase people doing average everyday things that anyone of us can go and do ourselves right now. And so, coming at you right now are 7 (and yes I decided on 7 seeing as how ten is so mainstream now) unique anime about real world activities. \\n\\n***Just want to throw out there that if anyone reading this is interested, I do have a video version of this which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDL7DApb1c***\\n\\n#7: Yuri!!! On ICE (Figure Skating)\\nQuick, tell me everything you know about figure skating. Moves, how competitions work, what it takes to train to be a figure skater, just throw it out. What’s that, you don’t know anything about figure skating and have never really had in interest in it before? Honestly, I probably would have said the same thing not long ago. Until I watched Yuri on Ice that is. Revolving around failed Japanese figure skater Yuri Katsuki, the series is basically an underdog story at heart, showing how Yuri, with help from his idol turned coach, Victor Nikiforov, gets back into figure skating and works his way up to competing in the Figure Skating Grand Prix. Featuring great music, some comedy, and even an unexpected romance, I found it really cool how this anime not only gave me a character to cheer for in his respective sport but taught me some stuff about the world of figure skating as well. While it didn’t cause me to rush to the nearest ice rink to try it out for myself I still appreciate the newfound insight and appreciation for the sport.  \\n\\n#6: Welcome to the Ballroom (Competitive Ballroom Dancing)\\nThe plot of this anime is simple enough: Our protagonist, Tatara Fujita, is a kid without any true passions or knowing what he wants from life. However, after following a classmate after school one day to a dance studio and discovering the world of dance, he falls deeply in love with the sport. Realizing that he has found his calling, he decides that he will pursue it with everything he has, no matter the obstacle. From there it’s all about following Tatara on his journey as he learns basic moves, different dance styles, how competitions work, and even how to work together with a dance partner. Now it may not sound like much and trust me, if you told me that one day I’d be tuning in week after week to watch an anime about competitive ballroom dancing, I’d be skeptical at best. However, seeing how Tatara grows and puts in the effort to get better, as well as watching the way these competitions play out is quite a fun watch. Not only that but the interactions between Tatara and the fellow dancers, whether comedic or dramatic, give the show a very life like feel to it that I want to watch more of.  \\n\\n#5: Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju (Rakugo)\\nStill way too underrated and unknown a series in my opinion, this next entry is all about Rakugo. Rakugo as I’m guessing not many people will know, is a form of Japanese verbal entertainment in which a lone storyteller sits on a stage and using only a paper fan and a small cloth depicts a long and complicated comical story. Think of it as similar to stand-up comedy except much more formal and with the performer remaining in a certain sitting position at all times. Now, in what we can call the story’s present day, a man named Yotaro is released from prison and after a bit of begging, becomes the apprentice of a famous rakugo performer. As we watch him learn the trade and hone his skills, we also flashback to the famous Rakugo performer’s past and see how he and a former friend got their start in the business. What makes this anime great is that not only is it a drama involving the characters and their struggle to reach popularity in this branch of entertainment, but it is almost like a lesson on a forgotten art form as well. Not only do you get a very well written and animated show but gain insight into a form of historical culture.\\n\\n#4: Your Lie in April (Piano & Classical Music)\\nI’d be surprised if anyone hadn’t heard of this one but just in case here goes: Your Lie in April tells the story of former child prodigy, Kōsei Arima. Once a huge success at playing piano, it has been two years since he last played due to him suffering a mental breakdown at his last piano recital. Now living his life dull and with any thoughts of playing the piano far behind him, everything changes for Kōsei when he meets the free-spirited violinist Kaori Miyazono. As he gets to know Kaori and is pushed by her to take up piano again, his world begins to gain color and for the first time in his life he starts to play piano with true feeling. What more can I say? Sweet, depressing, and everything in between this anime is a must watch. However, what is incredible is that not only is the central story good but the way we see piano recitals and classical music performed for us is breathtaking. It’s the kind of thing where I know I walked away wanting to hear more classical music pieces and found myself replaying certain episodes for the performances.  \\n  \\n#3: Bakuman. (Creating Manga)\\nIf you are watching this video then there is no way you are not at least somewhat familiar with manga as a medium and the concept of successful manga being adapted into anime. Getting quite meta Bakuman tells the story of two ninth grade boys named Moritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi who team up to become manga artists with Mashiro as the artist and Takagi as the writer. Working together under the pen name Muto Ashirogi, their dream is getting serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump, having one their manga adapted into an anime, and being the greatest mangaka Japan has ever seen. While this story isn’t a Shōnen in the usual sense with epic fights and leveling up and all that it still does a great job of showing the characters fight for what they want as they always aim to better themselves, facing many challenges and rivals along the way. Think of it as if they use their pens instead of swords to fight. As for how great a job the series does at portraying its central concept of creating manga, I thought it was really insightful. Sure I’ve never attempted to make a manga but the way it explains stuff such as 7 major steps to manga creation and 6 key elements to a successful Shōnen manga sound correct. Not only that but with the series having received praise for its accuracy depicting the realities of the job, and going on for a total of 75 episodes, it must have done something right. \\n\\n#2: Bartender (Making Drinks)\\nNow while a show about a guy mixing drinks doesn’t sound like the world’s most interesting premise, the show does a great job of earning its keep and making the world of Bartender interesting in its own right. You know the old saying about bartenders being like therapists? Well each episode focuses on different customers and their varying problems, and follows bartender Ryū Sasakura as he helps his clients as only he knows how: listening to their problems and then serving them the right drink. While this might not sound like much, the world of Bartender is interesting in that the alcohol isn’t seen as a way to get drunk but instead as a way to open up and start an earnest conversation of self-reflection with oneself. In this way we get a pretty nice, chill series about hanging out and taking a load off. And oh, as for the drinks featured, similar to how sometimes food is portrayed in other works in a super detailed “food porn” way, we get to see drinks made in great detail and the taste described very in depth. \\n\\n#1: Sweetness & Lightning (Cooking)\\nSpeaking of food, if you feel like you could use some new recipes this show has you covered, featuring quite a few throughout its run. From delicious doughnuts to a hearty Hamburg steak, it’s really cool how we get to watch the characters make food that feel like anyone with a bit of cooking experience can strive to make. In fact, many people have done just that, dedicating YouTube videos and various websites to showing recipes from the show come to life. As for story, the show follows widower Kōhei Inuzuka, a teacher who has been raising his young daughter by himself following the death of his wife. Having lost her only half a year before to an unknown illness, the two have been in somewhat of a funk and Kōhei has only been buying ready-made meals for his daughter. However, after an encounter with one of his students whose mother owns a restaurant, he decides to take up cooking in order to provide proper meals for his daughter. With plenty of interaction between father and daughter, as they bond over cooking and try to cope with the death of a loved one, the show is super sweet to the point of almost giving you diabeetus.   \\n\\n#0: Keijo!!!!!!!! (Lady Sumo?)\\nFor anyone not familiar with Keijo, in the show, it is a new, women-only, gambling sport. Held atop floating platforms, referred to as \"Land\", in large water-filled stadiums, swimsuit-clad women fight to incapacitate their opponents or push them down to the water below using only their breasts or buttocks. I felt I had to include this entry because believe it or not, in a somewhat strange example of life imitating art, Keijo has come to the real world. Apparently the women of Portugal loved the show enough that they are indeed turning it into a real thing in their country. Sure it doesn’t look as flashy as the anime but hey, got to start somewhere huh? \\n', 'comments': []}]"
