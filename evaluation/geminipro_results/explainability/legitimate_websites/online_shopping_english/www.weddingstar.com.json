However, it does advertise personalized gifts, which is a characteristic of scam websites. I should check if it handles different products from common e-commerce websites. I do not see any hyperlinks that redirect to different products from common e-commerce websites. I should check if it has claims of getting an amount of money that is generally not possible. I still do not see any claims of getting an amount of money that is generally not possible. However, it does advertise personalized gifts, which could target human psychological weaknesses. I should check if the company is non-existent. The WHOIS information shows that the company is not non-existent.
