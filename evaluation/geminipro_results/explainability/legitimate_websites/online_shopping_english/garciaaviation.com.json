The WHOIS information shows that the domain was registered in 1998 and is set to expire in 2024. This indicates that the website has been around for a while, which is a good sign. However, I should investigate further to see if there are any other red flags. The website appears to be a legitimate business that sells aviation-related items. The content of the website is not suspicious. I could not find any negative reviews or complaints about Garcia Aviation Co. on X/Twitter. I could not find any negative reviews or complaints about Garcia Aviation Co. on Reddit either. I could not find any suspicious DNS records associated with the website. I now know the final answer I should first access the URL to get the status code. I now know the final answer.",
