        "result": "true",

        "reason": "The URL is accessible and has a status code of 200 indicating that it is a live website. The website claims to offer free shipping on all orders which is an unusually low price. Additionally the website handles different products from common e-commerce websites such as shoes handbags and accessories. The website also has a privacy policy and terms of use but the privacy of customer information notation is ambiguous. Therefore I conclude that the website is a scam."
