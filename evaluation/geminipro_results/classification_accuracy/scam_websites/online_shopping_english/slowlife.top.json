However, if you have any recommendations from any sort of media (anime, manga, light novels, books, fanfictions) that follow a similar theme of normal humans slowly becoming better at fighting then please let me know:)\\n\\ninstant “turn offs” are:\\n\\n•cheat skills or weapons\\n•too much pervy gags or characters\\n•romance with really weird age gaps', 'comments': ['It\\'s not the same kind of series, but you might check out [Ascendance of a Bookworm](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39468/Honzuki_no_Gekokujou__Shisho_ni_Naru_Tame_ni_wa_Shudan_wo_Erandeiraremasen) (AoaB). \\n\\nAoaB is an isekai about a girl who ... loves books. She dies and is reincarnated into the body of a sickly girl. And when I say sickly, I mean she spends her first arc building enough strength to walk to the gate of the city. And getting to the gate is important because the family she was born into is a commoner family in a pseudo-medieval world, which means books are far too expensive. Thanks to that, she decided that if she can\\'t buy books, she\\'ll make them herself. \\n\\nObviously this is not a combat oriented series, though there are battles every few books (very, very small scale but growing in size). Instead, it\\'s more about the creation process, as well as interacting with people, and politics. The Main Character spent so much of her previous life wrapped up in books that she never looked at the people around her, and her \"ascendance\" in this world is as a person living a more fulfilling life. \\n\\nThe reason I brought this up is because it fulfills most of your requests not related to combat. \\n\\nShe builds up her strength and abilities very slowly, and even participates in combat to a limited degree. But when she does participate in combat sometimes it goes wrong (really wrong). \\n\\nRelationships are a central part of the series. \\n\\nWomen are in fact most of the central characters of the series, and they are quite complex. \\n\\nWhat parts are \"OP\" feel earned, and don\\'t take away from anything because the weaknesses balance out. \\n\\nIt is also a very well written series, and the author actually wrote the entire plot out before she committing to writing the book. Thanks to that, it\\'s filled to the brim with foreshadowing and references that won\\'t make any sense until later on. \\n\\nThe anime is pretty good, but they skim over a lot, especially in season 2. The LNs are your best option.\\n\\nEdits: Clarity', 'Let me convince you. This Fall 2023: Sousou no Frieren, if they do the manga justice, there should be similar vibes but in adventure shorts format.', 'Grimgar is my favourite anime, and the light novel is better imo, so read that if you want more I’d really reccomend it.\\n\\nI’m really hard pushed to find anything remotely similar that I’ve watched, and not from a lack of trying.\\n\\nFrom looking at my watch list, the first one that game to mind was danmachi, or “is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon”. As the name sounds, it really comes under “to many Pervy gags or charachters, and I struggled to finish season one when it first aired. HOWEVER I think it’s worth considering as after season 4 aired I heard people rating it really highly saying it was fantastic, so I gave it a try. S1 has the mc go through a similar arc of being underwhelming at first as you experience in grimgar. s4 displays that gritty realism theme the grimgar does (better then danmachi) so well. The female charachters whilst used a lot for fan service did feel really well developed, especially the main leads in s4. However I think the mc becomes a bit to overpowered throughout the show to really compare it to grimgar, and I’d honestly class it as cheat skill as well. But I wanted to throw it out there as it’s the closest isekai I’ve seen that goes towards the mc being weak at the start and having moments of proper life or death gritty realism.\\n\\nAttack on Titan? Kinda? They are really bad at the start, the dialogue between charachters is well developed, and the idea that something going wrong will lead to dire consequence is a really big theme of the show. But again they do get way stronger then haruhiro.\\n\\nI can’t think of like action/ fantasy for the other points like having hobbies and such. “Rascal does not dream of a bunny girl senpai” is really good at charachrer building and interaction, and the anime just wasn’t as perverted compared to the literal name of it. \\n\\nSummertime rendering kinda? It has good dialogue, no one is really to overpowered especially at the start, and the story is gripping and interesting.\\n\\nMadoka magica + magia record: my third favourite anime always feels like they are fighting against an impossible fate, and I really enjoy both. \\n\\nAnd sod it, mekakucity actors is just amazing for story and charachrer development. They aren’t strong, there’s no perversion outside of a few random jokes in the first episode, and it’s my second favourite anime.\\n\\nSorry I kinda just started listing anime I liked towards the end, but it just shows that grimgar really feels like one of a kind and that’s what makes it soooooo fucking good. It hits every spot and it’s niche is amazing. \\n\\nAlso I ain’t some pervert, I don’t watch stuff like danmachi usually it’s just the closest thing I could think off lmaooo.', 'Re Zero, Gintama, Bleach, Kagerou Project', \"So one you may like is 86. It has a very character driven narrative, strong consequences based story and growth/character development, and the romance is top notch and the characters are the same age. \\n\\nThe one character you might hate is the Male MC. He is The Best Pilot in the series, from page 1. You know that going in, it would kinda be like if Renji was in Haru's group.\"]}, {'title': 'Lightnovel recommendations based on my reading list', 'subreddit': 'LightNovels', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/LightNovels/comments/srnb6o/lightnovel_recommendations_based_on_my_reading/', 'selftext': \"Hi,\\n\\nI am looking for recommendations on which novel to read based on the novels that I have read. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0zaqp53tmh81.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e76f7dbdd6b0939bd4f07b4b91ff1f7e9d41e81\\n\\nAmong the list, my top 3 are probably kuma kuma kuma bear, moto sekai ichi'i no....., and tensei shite inaka de slowlife. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI have also liked villainess mangas in the past and am open to suggestion in that genre as well.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThanks for the help!!!\", 'comments': ['>Type the [REC] tag in the beginning title for posts that are asking for novel recommendations.\\r\\n\\r\\nLight Novel recommendation request posts require the **[REC] tag in the beginning of the title.** (With brackets) Please do read over the submission guidelines more carefully in the future.

(Without Spoilers) It\\'ll help people find series with similar styles and themes.\\r\\n* Don\\'t slander series. If you don\\'t like a series, it\\'s fine to say that you don\\'t like it. But if you start bashing a bunch of series, why would people want to recommend you something? \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\'re new to the medium and looking to start reading as a beginner, please keep the following in mind. As the industry grows and new series are introduced all the time, there\\'s never a truly unifying \"good beginner series.\" The common sentiment is that if you\\'re new to Light Novels by way of another medium like anime or manga, your best bet when starting is to find some series with adaptations you already enjoy and to check if their source material has been licensed/translated. Light Novels aren\\'t a stylistic genre so asking for what are good light novels for beginners will range widely based on the person and their taste. It\\'s akin to asking the /r/Books \"What are some good books for beginners?\"', \"I recommend [Campfire Cooking in Another World with My Absurd Skill](https://j-novel.club/series/campfire-cooking-in-another-world-with-my-absurd-skill) and [Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear](https://sevenseasentertainment.com/series/kuma-kuma-kuma-bear-light-novel/).

She dies and is reincarnated into the body of a sickly girl. And when I say sickly, I mean she spends her first arc building enough strength to walk to the gate of the city. And getting to the gate is important because the family she was born into is a commoner family in a pseudo-medieval world, which means books are far too expensive. Thanks to that, she decided that if she can\\'t buy books, she\\'ll make them herself. \\n\\nObviously this is not a combat oriented series, though there are battles every few books (very, very small scale but growing in size). Instead, it\\'s more about the creation process, as well as interacting with people, and politics. The Main Character spent so much of her previous life wrapped up in books that she never looked at the people around her, and her \"ascendance\" in this world is as a person living a more fulfilling life. \\n\\nThe reason I brought this up is because it fulfills most of your requests not related to combat. \\n\\nShe builds up her strength and abilities very slowly, and even participates in combat to a limited degree. But when she does participate in combat sometimes it goes wrong (really wrong). \\n\\nRelationships are a central part of the series. \\n\\nWomen are in fact most of the central characters of the series, and they are quite complex. \\n\\nWhat parts are \"OP\" feel earned, and don\\'t take away from anything because the weaknesses balance out. \\n\\nIt is also a very well written series, and the author actually wrote the entire plot out before she committing to writing the book. Thanks to that, it\\'s filled to the brim with foreshadowing and references that won\\'t make any sense until later on. \\n\\nThe anime is pretty good, but they skim over a lot, especially in season 2. The LNs are your best option.\\n\\nEdits: Clarity', 'Let me convince you. This Fall 2023: Sousou no Frieren, if they do the manga justice, there should be similar vibes but in adventure shorts format.', 'Grimgar is my favourite anime, and the light novel is better imo, so read that if you want more I’d really reccomend it.\\n\\nI’m really hard pushed to find anything remotely similar that I’ve watched, and not from a lack of trying.\\n\\nFrom looking at my watch list, the first one that game to mind was danmachi, or “is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon”. As the name sounds, it really comes under “to many Pervy gags or charachters, and I struggled to finish season one when it first aired. HOWEVER I think it’s worth considering as after season 4 aired I heard people rating it really highly saying it was fantastic, so I gave it a try. S1 has the mc go through a similar arc of being underwhelming at first as you experience in grimgar. s4 displays that gritty realism theme the grimgar does (better then danmachi) so well. The female charachters whilst used a lot for fan service did feel really well developed, especially the main leads in s4. However I think the mc becomes a bit to overpowered throughout the show to really compare it to grimgar, and I’d honestly class it as cheat skill as well. But I wanted to throw it out there as it’s the closest isekai I’ve seen that goes towards the mc being weak at the start and having moments of proper life or death gritty realism.\\n\\nAttack on Titan? Kinda? They are really bad at the start, the dialogue between charachters is well developed, and the idea that something going wrong will lead to dire consequence is a really big theme of the show. But again they do get way stronger then haruhiro.\\n\\nI can’t think of like action/ fantasy for the other points like having hobbies and such. “Rascal does not dream of a bunny girl senpai” is really good at charachrer building and interaction, and the anime just wasn’t as perverted compared to the literal name of it. \\n\\nSummertime rendering kinda? It has good dialogue, no one is really to overpowered especially at the start, and the story is gripping and interesting.\\n\\nMadoka magica + magia record: my third favourite anime always feels like they are fighting against an impossible fate, and I really enjoy both. \\n\\nAnd sod it, mekakucity actors is just amazing for story and charachrer development. They aren’t strong, there’s no perversion outside of a few random jokes in the first episode, and it’s my second favourite anime.\\n\\nSorry I kinda just started listing anime I liked towards the end, but it just shows that grimgar really feels like one of a kind and that’s what makes it soooooo fucking good. It hits every spot and it’s niche is amazing. \\n\\nAlso I ain’t some pervert, I don’t watch stuff like danmachi usually it’s just the closest thing I could think off lmaooo.', 'Re Zero, Gintama, Bleach, Kagerou Project', \"So one you may like is 86. It has a very character driven narrative, strong consequences based story and growth/character development, and the romance is top notch and the characters are the same age. \\n\\nThe one character you might hate is the Male MC. He is The Best Pilot in the series, from page 1.

But if you start bashing a bunch of series, why would people want to recommend you something? \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\'re new to the medium and looking to start reading as a beginner, please keep the following in mind. As the industry grows and new series are introduced all the time, there\\'s never a truly unifying \"good beginner series.\" The common sentiment is that if you\\'re new to Light Novels by way of another medium like anime or manga, your best bet when starting is to find some series with adaptations you already enjoy and to check if their source material has been licensed/translated. Light Novels aren\\'t a stylistic genre so asking for what are good light novels for beginners will range widely based on the person and their taste. It\\'s akin to asking the /r/Books \"What are some good books for beginners?\"', \"I recommend [Campfire Cooking in Another World with My Absurd Skill](https://j-novel.club/series/campfire-cooking-in-another-world-with-my-absurd-skill) and [Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear](https://sevenseasentertainment.com/series/kuma-kuma-kuma-bear-light-novel/).
