With our budget, we can\\'t find anything decent that does not need a full revamp ...  (looking for at least 3 beds with a nice garden at £500k). We\\'ve been visiting a few villages around and recent developments. The ones from Redrow appeared as good matches in terms of the quality of the buildings and development size (not as Gigantic as Northstowe or Waterbeach). We are wondering about the pros and cons of living in the south vs the north of Cam -- one development is in Cottenham while the two others are in Barrington and Sawston. I work at the train station, so we figured out that the south would be easier in terms of access, but at the same time the train station in Waterbeach could also solve this issue and the development in Cottenham is MUCH cheaper (£410k vs £465k in Sawston for the same house). We felt like this was explained by the pretty much \"dead-flat\" feeling of the northern part. Is this just a feeling? We only passed by in a car, so it\\'s hard to judge, but we felt like we would find much fewer shops, amenities, activities as well as nice walks that aren\\'t just a big field in the north of Cam than in the south. In particular, we have dogs and we usually walk them twice a day, we therefore would love to find places where other doggies are walking daily to have a bit of interactions, such as we can have in Coldham\\'s common, and this part of Cottenham (north-west) felt a bit empty. We don\\'t know much about Barrington and we have only been twice to Sawston -- so we don\\'t know if, from this doggy perspective, it would be better. The center of Sawston felt a bit more lively than Cottenham as well (but is it true?). The last aspect of this story is the value of the housing market - with Cottenham being right in the middle of giga-omega-crazy developments containing thousands of houses, we\\'re a bit afraid that the market will crash a bit in this area, just like what happened in Northstowe/longstanton. Also, we\\'ve been in Northstowe, and how my god it feels so life-less (maybe just a feeling as well??) is this true for the northern part of Cam. in general? \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThanks for your help Reddit! ', 'comments': ['unless you are absolutely dedicated on being in one of the nearby villages, ely is the place to be. good amenities, nice walks, easy train to cambridge. we moved a year ago and you could buy a palace with that budget, although you do seem to only mention new build developments.', \"I just moved to Waterbeach a month ago! £325k for a three bed (but small garden), recently renovated. I highly recommend Waterbeach! For a small place it has sooo many amenities, in no particular order:\\n- 4 pubs\\n- primary school\\n- hairdressers\\n- Chinese takeaway\\n- Indian restaurant\\n- 3 churches of different denominations\\n- cafe that does pizza delivery (24/7)\\n- pharmacy\\n- opticians\\n- GP\\n- co-op and a corner shop\\n- sports hall with tennis and squash courts\\n- military museum\\n- gym\\nAlso seems to be plenty going on, monthly little market, carols signing and stuff on the green at Christmas. And one stop away from Cambridge or Ely in either direction on the train. My wife's been busting into centre of Cambridge for work: very doable she says.\\n\\nGorgeous walks along the river up to Cam and in the old RAF base they're converting into housing too. Lovely little artificial lake they've built there.\", \"I moved to Cottenham coming up to 2.5 years ago, £320k for a three bed end of terrace with a garden. I really love it here, it's far enough away from Cambridge that it has lots of amenities: Co-op, couple of corner shops/post office, greengrocer, butchers, Indian takeaway, 2 pubs (including one with great Italian pizza), community centre, cafe, bakery/deli (with some of the best sourdough and freshly made sandwiches I've ever had!), 2 car garages, travis perkins, vet, dog grooming, 3-4 hairdressers, pharmacy, 2 GPs, dentist, primary school, daycare, college. I'm forgetting some other stuff but it even has a picture framers and sawmill! When moving here we looked at places in Longstanton/Northstowe (agreed with what you said!), St Ives, Ely, Waterbeach and Cottenham, with Cottenham striking the right balance of what we were looking for.\\n\\nOne thing about Cottenham is that it's a really  long village that follows the high street so it can feel a bit empty at times, but the various new developments are changing that by expanding further beyond the high street stretches of housing. I quite like that the developments all seem to be fairly small compared with the Northstowe and Waterbeach ones which feel like they're swallowing up what was already there. The village has a really nice community feel with tons of clubs and activities which you can find out about in the village newsletter. We even have a village NGO which I joined focused on sustainability initiatives.\\n\\nTravel-wise there's a bus but it can be quite unreliable so I mostly cycle. That's worked both with jobs going into Cambridge and London (the latter cycling to Waterbeach to catch the train). I also really like how close it is to Ely which is lovely.\\n\\nMy partner and I live a pretty active/outdoorsy lifestyle and moved here from Cornwall. We were quite worried about access to nature and trails, the fenlands are indeed very flat but I do find they have their own charm. That's quite a lot of nice trails for running/cycling/walking in and around the village. While they're not exactly wild (I find nowhere really is around these parts) there's much more than just fields. There are nice walks alongside rivers and through the fenland, there are a few small woods nearby, it's close to Wicken Fen and Fen Drayton (both by car though).\\n\\nHope this helps and happy to answer any other questions :)\", 'I was wondering how you thought literally any of the towns you mentioned were in north Cambridgeshire, but you literally just mean north of Cambridge. \\n\\nI would 100% not reccomend north Cambridgeshire (which I would say was Chatteris and up) it’s just boring fens.', 'I live slightly further out in south cambs and am obsessed with Barrington so I’d say there for sure!']}, {'title': 'Refund of New Build Upgrades - Failure to exchange contracts', 'subreddit': 'LegalAdviceUK', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/q796o6/refund_of_new_build_upgrades_failure_to_exchange/', 'selftext': 'Hi,\\n\\nHope someone can help, we are currently struggling to get our chain to exchange contracts so we can exchange contract with Redrow on a house still being built (expected December build completion).\\n\\nWhen we reserved the house for £1000 we had 2 days to make orders before the order deadline as the house was already almost complete.\\n\\nI spoke many times with the sales advisor on email about orders, etc and asked lots of questions. I asked if I could pay via bank transfer for the orders I sent to them via email (as it was too late to order on the website due to deadlines being passed, they requested me to send email with order list).\\n\\nThey then manually added my email requests to the website and told me I had to pay via card on that site (costs were over £30,000).\\n\\nWhen I went to pay I had to tick a box to agree to terms and conditions, but did not read fully as I asked most of my important questions to the sales person. On the email order form I asked the below before paying :-\\n\\n>As discussed please find below all required Upgrades :-As we spoke about such a large payment and the risks associated please see below, Please could you confirm back on the below :-  \\n>  \\n>If for any reason our chain broke down which would be  advised by solicitors, any issue with mortgage on this property or if  you cancelled our order on the home then this upgrade money would be  refunded ?\\n\\nI was responded to with :-\\n\\n>I will send the below across to site asap and confirm if they can authorise, once authorised you will need to pay immediately.  \\n>  \\n>As you have not exchanged, if for any reason the sale doesn\\'t go  through we will refund the options paid and £700 of the reservation fee  less £300 for admin fees.  \\n>  \\n>I will confirm asap once authorised.\\n\\nI was also confirmed this once again 5 days later on a separate query regarding the upgrades.\\n\\nI am now worried they will not refund this money due to a statement I see in their terms and conditions below :-\\n\\n>Please note that products ordered online via My Redrow are non-refundable, subject to limited exceptions detailed below. This means that you may not receive a refund for your order even in the event that you are unable to complete on the purchase of the home.  \\n>  \\n>In purchasing products prior to exchange of contracts or completion, you do so at your own risk. For the avoidance of doubt this includes products ordered online via My Redrow, by telephone or at Redrow premises.\\n\\nI have kept all communications with Redrow confirming I would be fully refunded but now am losing sleep that they will quote their terms and conditions which I ignorantly did not read properly accepting the information from the sales person.\\n\\nCan someone advise if terms and conditions like the above override what the sales person has told me under law?\\n\\nThe confusing part for me was I had to make the order via email instead of directly on their shopping basket, so was using their guidance as clear information. Only after me emailing them, they manually added all items I then had to log on and \"check out\".\\n\\nHope someone can help.  \\n\\n\\nEdit : Located in England,', 'comments': [\"---\\n###Welcome to /r/LegalAdviceUK\\n---\\n\\n\\n**To Posters (it is important you read this section)**\\n\\n* *Tell us whether you're in England, Wales, Scotland, or NI as the laws in each are very different*\\n\\n* Reddit is not [a substitute for a qualified Solicitor](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/wiki/faq_civil#wiki_how_do_i_find_a_.28good.29_solicitor.3F) and comments are not moderated for quality or accuracy;\\n\\n* Any replies received must only be used as guidelines, followed at your own risk;\\n\\n* If you receive *any* private messages in response to your post, [please let the mods know](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FLegalAdviceUK&subject=I received a PM);\\n\\n* It is the default position of LAUK that [you should never speak to the media](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/wiki/faq_subreddit#wiki_should_i_speak_to_the_media.3F);\\n\\n* Check out our [Common Legal Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/wiki/common_legal_resources) for helpful organisations to contact;\\n\\n* If you do not receive satisfactory advice after 72 hours, [you can let the mods know](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FLegalAdviceUK&subject=My question is unanswered);\\n\\n* Please provide an update at a later time by creating a new post with [[update]](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/search?q=%3Aupdate&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) in the title;\\n\\n**To Readers and Commenters**    \\n\\n* [All replies to OP must be *on-topic, helpful, and legally orientated*](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/oslgn6/so_you_dont_want_your_comment_removed_guidance_on/?);\\n\\n* If you do not [follow the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/about/rules/), you may be banned without any further warning;\\n\\n* Please include links to reliable resources in order to support your comments or advice;\\n\\n* If you feel any replies are incorrect, explain why you believe they are incorrect;\\n\\n* [Do not send or request any private messages for any reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/wiki/faq_subreddit#wiki_why_am_i_not_allowed_to_privately_message_people_on_this_subreddit.3F);\\n\\n* Please report posts or comments which do not follow the rules\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
