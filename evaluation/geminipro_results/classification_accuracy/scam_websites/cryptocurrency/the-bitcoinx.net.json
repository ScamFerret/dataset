However, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. This means every node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) needs to upgrade before the new blockchain with the hard fork activates and rejects any blocks or transactions from the old blockchain. The Bitcoin mining community also attests that the expansion of mining can help lead to the construction of new solar and wind farms in the future.\\n However, during the first few years of BTC’s existence, the competition between miners was relatively low, allowing the earliest network participants to accumulate significant amounts of coins via regular mining: Satoshi Nakamoto alone is believed to own over a million Bitcoin.\\n'}, {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin', 'content': 'Since 2014, regulated bitcoin funds also allow exposure to the asset or to futures as an investment.[119][120] Individuals and companies such as the Winklevoss twins[121] and Elon Musk\\'s companies SpaceX and Tesla have massively invested in Bitcoin.[122][123] Bitcoin wealth is highly concentrated, with 0.01% holding 27% of in-circulation currency, as of 2021.[124] As of September\\xa02023[update], El Salvador had $76.5 million worth of bitcoin in its international reserves.[125]\\nIn 2018, research published in the Journal of Monetary Economics concluded that price manipulation occurred during the Mt. Gox bitcoin theft and that the market remained vulnerable to manipulation.[126] Research published in The Journal of Finance also suggested that trading associated with increases in the amount of the Tether cryptocurrency and associated trading at the Bitfinex exchange accounted for about half of the price increase in bitcoin in late 2017.[127][128]\\nBitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, has been described as an economic bubble by several economists, including Nobel Prize in Economics laureates, such as Joseph Stiglitz,[129] James Heckman,[10] and Paul Krugman.[94] A few entities also dominate other parts of the ecosystem such as the client software, online wallets, and simplified payment verification (SPV) clients.[57]\\nEconomics and usage\\nBitcoin\\'s theoretical roots and ideology\\nAccording to the European Central Bank, the decentralization of money offered by bitcoin has its theoretical roots in the Austrian school of economics, especially with Friedrich von Hayek\\'s book The Denationalization of Money, in which he advocates a complete free market in the production, distribution and management of money to end the monopoly of central banks.[90]:\\u200a22\\u200a Sociologist Nigel Dodd, citing the crypto-anarchist Declaration of Bitcoin\\'s Independence, argues that the essence of the bitcoin ideology is to remove money from social, as well as governmental, control.[91] The use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators, legislative bodies, and law enforcement.[101] Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz says that bitcoin\\'s anonymity encourages money laundering and other crimes.[102] This is the main justification behind bitcoin bans.[11] As of November\\xa02021[update], nine countries applied an absolute ban (Algeria, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, and Tunisia) while another 42 countries had an implicit ban.[103][needs update] Bitcoin is only legal tender in El Salvador.[4]\\nUse for payments\\nAs of 2018[update], Bitcoin is rarely used in transactions with merchants,[104] but it is popular to purchase illegal goods online.[105][106] Prices are not usually quoted in bitcoin and trades involve conversions into fiat currencies.[25] Commonly cited reasons for not using Bitcoin include high costs, the inability to process chargebacks, high price volatility, long transaction times, transaction fees (especially for small purchases).[104][107] Miners group and broadcast new transactions into blocks, which are then verified by the network.[58] Each block must contain a proof-of-work (PoW) to be accepted,[58] involving finding a nonce number that, combined with the block content, produces a hash numerically smaller than the network\\'s difficulty target.[9]:\\u200ach. 8\\u200a This PoW is simple to verify but hard to generate, requiring many attempts.[9]:\\u200ach. 8\\u200a PoW forms the basis of Bitcoin\\'s consensus mechanism.[66]\\nThe difficulty of generating a block is deterministically adjusted based on the mining power on the network by changing the difficulty target, which is recalibrated every 2,016 blocks (approximately two weeks) to maintain an average time of ten minutes between new blocks. According to one 2022 analysis published in The Journal of Alternative Investments, bitcoin was less volatile than oil, silver, US Treasuries, and 190 stocks in the S&P 500 during and after the 2020 stock market crash.[132] The term \"hodl\" was created in December 2013 for holding Bitcoin rather than selling it during periods of volatility.[133][134]\\nEconomists, investors, and the central bank of Estonia have described bitcoin as a potential Ponzi scheme.[135][136][137] Legal scholar Eric Posner disagrees as \"a real Ponzi scheme takes fraud; bitcoin, by contrast, seems more like a collective delusion.\"[138] A 2014 World Bank report also concluded that bitcoin was not a deliberate Ponzi scheme.[139]\\nSee also\\n'}, {'url': 'https://bitcoin.org/', 'content': 'Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network.
