Why the use of such a dark colour for the typography on a black background?', \"It's a fun design but it needs some refining. The first version is the best so I'll critique that one. The typeface looks cheap, almost like it was hand lettered with the pen tool. There are plenty of free options for logotype that will elevate the quality and professionalism of your illustration significantly. Also, the fact that there's no spacing between the lettering (which I'm sure was an intentional design choice) creates a big mess for legibility. Your chameleon is awesome but I think it could be reworked to be less reliant on the stroke. That goes double for the stroke around the logo type. The subtype doesn't need to be italicized.\", 'I like image 5. In my opinion that stands out a long way above the others. In places the font looks a bit strange like it’s been stretched though. maybe increase the contrast between the two greens on the eyes. I really like how the shield and the cross design were incorporated though. V clever and still very recognisable as a chameleon. \\n\\nPlease do not use the shirr et of in the final image. It looks like it was made in Microsoft publisher ‘95. I think it’s the gradient and font style. Just screams wordart.\\n\\nOne thing that’s a theme throughout is not enough s  out ace between things. The text on your shields would look much better if it was slightly smaller to leave a border between that and the edge of the shield. In a similar vain, the text needs to come down from the chameleon face to give it a bit if room.', 'I think Eras although just slightly italic does not work within the crest.

My personality was mostly like a bowing cameleon until 1 year ago: always agreeing with family, always there when needed, never saying no, adapting to everything, and finally, a perfect slave. I hated people for so many years, I forgot how I can make new connections. I completely closed myself in, into my own world, and did not let anyone in, until I\\'ve met with my wife. I have so many discomforts, anxiety, anger, sadnass in me, I could be a perfect sith.\\n\\n\\r  \\nMother: hiding narc. She tells she always look for other people first, but manupilating everyone around her. She always tells we have the same personality.. manipulated so many times from the beggining, I cannot distinguish what are her real emotions anymore. Sometimes I feel I abandoned her, because I was raised by \"family is all you have. She tells, \"you cannot love 2 children with the same amount of love\" and \"Family will be always on your side. We can die any time, and you will regret.\". Now she says she doesn\\'t understand why I left her, and it is not fair. (told this to my mother in law) I will try to list some \"not fair\" history of mine later. She told several times to my wife, I\\'m the perfect man in the world.. Tried to poison our relationship with my wife several times..\\n\\n\\r  \\nFather: died few years ago. I was not speaking with him for 2 years when he died. He was alcoholic, the aggressive type, and died because of drinking and taking pills. Once he was a successful businessman, but fall from heaven to hell because his company cracked. He beated everyone in my family: my brother, my mother, and me. (In frequency order) I didn\\' get beatings many times, because I was learning from brother\\'s mistakes, and learned to obey to avoid slaps.\\r  \\nBrother: he needs serious psychological attention. Aggressive, hot-headed, sometimes narrow-minded. He suffered a lot, because of my father.\\r  \\nMe: I was a shy, soft kid. Cried a lot until 2-3rd grade. I felt I need so many love, I always tried to have a girlfriend, but the girls didn\\'t accept me. I always felt I\\'m not fitting to the family, and I don\\'t get enough attention/love, although they tried to show love, it was not what I needed. My family successfully killed the softness out of me. I\\'m 32 now, and I\\'m not able to cry, or be happy because of presents. I cannot show my emotions in several occasions.\\r  \\nSome history:\\r  \\n\\\\-I got bullied at school, since 1st grade. It was so serious, I tried to avoid school by going to school doctor. My mother knew they are bullying me, but did nothing. Years later my family is laughing about my stories, how I avoided class.\\r  \\n\\\\-bullied by brother. He beated me several times, for different reasons. No serious beatings, just some slaps, but it was enough to terrorize my soft soul. After 18, we had a normalised relationship, probably because I had built some muscles, and he was afraid of me. \\r  \\n\\\\-my family went broke, my university studies was in danger. I had to work since I was 19. Sometimes I was literally starving. I could finish the university.\\r  \\n\\\\-I was smoking for 3-4 years. Started because I could not handle stress. It helped me to survive the starving phase. (Both parents were smoking, even near the kids)\\r  \\n\\\\-I had a friend at elementary school, and he died when I was 14, in a car accident. I was devestated, and that was the last time I was criing.\\r  \\n\\\\-I still have no friends.\\r  \\n\\\\-I was playing football for several years, this helped me to survive this messy life.\\r  \\n\\\\-I was moved more than 10 times, I cannot even count.\\r  \\n\\\\-I was the all-rounder slave at home: do the gardening, heavy lifting objects (sometimes 70+ kg fridges), be a cook, be a house cleaner, help to grandparents in farming and lot more.\\r  \\nBeacause I\\'m an overarchiever, I have a great job, and I\\'m good in my field. My wife helped me to start NC with my family.\\r  \\nAlthough I mostly had problem with my brother and my mother, I started NC with everyone.  \\n\\n\\nMy brother and mother always said I didn\\'t get as many problems as they had with my father. They are not respecting my boundaries: physical or mental. They always say they love me, but it does not feel natural/real, it is like they are overcompensating the past.. They try to manipulate me, directly or indirectly. They would like me to be the man near the house, but handle me as a child. I was always living for others. Missed so many things in my life already. Because of the lot of tragedy I had in my life, I declined the possibility of happiness from myself. I would like to live a normal life, and not being afraid from everything. I would like to be soft when needed, and joyful when it is time. I would like to live the life I always wanted.\\r  \\n\\n\\nAfter no contact for almost  year:\\r  \\nI feel guilt, sometimes more, sometimes less. I feel I\\'m doing something bad, and hurting other people.\\r  \\nI feel I have to go back to them, obey, and be a good boy.\\r  \\nI miss my not existing young adulthood, and childhood.\\r  \\nI feel I was a mistake. (And surely I was not a planned kid, mother told me.)\\r  \\n\\r  \\nBut as a result, my personality improved a lot thanks to the therapy. I feel I finally could put down the weight I was lifting, what almost made me kill myself years ago. I started to open for people, and enjoy the small things. I started to LIVE finally.  \\n\\n\\n I will need long time, because I wasted 30 years from my life to others, but I will heal, and live my better life.\\r  \\nI should have several longer and shorter stories, but I\\'m not that good writer. I\\'m already satisfied I could summarise this mess somehow.\\n\\n\\r  \\nTo everyone, who is still having contact with toxic family: it is worth to start NC! Not easy, and it won\\'t be easier, but as soon as you will feel the result, you will know it is worth it.\\n\\n\\r  \\nThank you for reading my story.
