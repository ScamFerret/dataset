His selection of Loveless knives is second to no one. He has the best knives available anywhere. Ed W. The site, like the name says, is indeed Exquisite! Far and away the most professional and beautiful knife site around.  Kind of like going to the Porsche dealer — the showroom is exponentially nicer than your local Ford or Audi dealership, because people who are buying Porsches or Bob L or Ron L knives, etc, expect a certain level of class.

He is selling probably the most beautiful knives you can find on the market and you can trust his advises. If you are looking for a rare high end custom knife his website is definitely the good address A.W. Dave Ellis is a very knowledgeable and well respected man in the knife community.  I met Dave about 15 years ago.  Not only has he been a good friend, but I could always count on his advice regarding knife collecting and how much I should expect to pay.  Guidance is very important when you collect knives, as it is a very expensive hobby.  Knowing what to invest in is also very important because you should keep in mind that as much as you may like your knives today, your taste in knives could change in the future.  At that point, you might want to sell or trade them, so purchase price is key. Whether buying or selling, I’ve always felt confident doing business with Dave. Jim Charnas I met Dave years ago in San Diego during an AKI show. Immediately I was impressed by what he transmitted to me: great passion and knowledge for fine knives, great professionalism and great honesty. Today, after many years, I can say that all my feelings were absolutely correct. Thank you Dave! Francesco Pachì Dear Dave, I accessed your newly updated site and was very impressed by it.
