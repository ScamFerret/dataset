I’m astounded with her attention to detail. I wish all stylists everywhere were 1/2 as good as she is!\" - Margaret V. \"A special thank you to Aja at the Squirrel Hill location. She liberated me from five months of overgrown hair and gave me a sweet and sassy style. Just what I wanted.\" Denise T. \"I wish there was a salon in Louisville KY but there is not.  My hair is gorgeous.  Tatiana really knows how to take care of curly hair.  Thank you.  I will ask her to cut my hair every time I'm in town.\" Kris Y. \"Kim K. at The Block Northway is amazing! She absolutely nails the color and cut I want every time! Recently, I had decided to continue growing out my hair back to its natural brown (that is turning more gray with age) from blonde. She did a fantastic job. It looks so natural - so much so, that no one has noticed, which I think is exactly the point. It looks so seamless. It has given me a ton of personal confidence that I truly needed. Thank you so much Kim!!\" Rachael K. Read More FREE SHIPPING & OFFERS Free shipping on online orders of $100 or more.
