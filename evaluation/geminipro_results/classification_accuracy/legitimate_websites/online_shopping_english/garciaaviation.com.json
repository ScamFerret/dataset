John has never claimed to take the place of Jerry, he’s never claimed to be in the Grateful Dead, and he doesn’t compare himself to Jerry nearly as much as you all do. John is in a completely separate band than Jerry, just as Further, The Dead, Phil Lesh‘s Family Band, etc. we’re all separate offshoots of the Dead. John was accepted to join Dead and Company to carry on the music as best as they can in the absence of Jerry, and it’s the best we’re gonna get from here on out. If you can’t get over the fact that John started by writing songs like You’re Body is a Wonderland 20 years ago, then spend the rest of your life listening to old shows on Relisten and stop complaining to everyone else how it’s not the same. \\n\\nComplaining and bashing people for their opinions about John is the exact opposite of what the true Dead Head mentality is, so either just accept that you’re not a Dead and Company fan and move on, or accept he’s here to stay and enjoy the most recent adaptation of the Dead to keep the spirit of the music alive. ', 'comments': ['It’s not a fair comparison, Jerry and John are rooted in different styles. Mayer is a capable musician who can shred, he must have known there would be comparisons and he would be under scrutiny, but decided to tour with the boys anyway so we can still hear their music live. As a young head that was born shortly after Jerry died, I’m grateful for that.', 'John rocks and he is not Jerry. I feel like that should be the end of the convo.', 'Prior to the 95 tour, Jerry tweeted out that he was channeling the spirit of young John Mayer.\\n\\nVery heartfelt.', 'As a Deadhead, I feel lucky to be able to witness Mayer’s work in D & C.  His huge talent is well utilized playing Dead songs with this band.  I think he stands head and shoulders above anyone who has tried to fill Jerry’s shoes.  The torch is being passed to someone with the talent and spirit to keep it burning.  After Bob, Billy, Mickey and Phil are gone, Mayer, Jeff and Oteil will be passionately sharing the trip with future generations.', \"I complained about him when he got the job because it felt like a money grab to bring in a new crowd, then I saw him play with the band live. He does a really good job. I'm still not going to see his shows or anything outside of Dead and Company but dude won me over really quick.
