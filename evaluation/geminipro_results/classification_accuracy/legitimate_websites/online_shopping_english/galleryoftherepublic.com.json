Our clients have enjoyed the finest hand-crafted historic flags, rare original maps and unique vintage documents. WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING As an old trial lawyer, I have never had anything displayed in my office that caused more conversation between ally and foe as I have with my flag collection. I have been privileged to have a number of flags from the Texas Fight for Independence created by Gallery of the Republic in Austin, Texas. It is not an uncommon thing for someone to ask a question such as “how did you get that original battle flag?” They do look that real. The Gallery does great work. The Honorable George Chandler Lufkin, Texas I have been purchasing beautiful handcrafted historic flags from your company since 1985. These celebrated treasures have adorned my office walls through the years. Thank you for your exemplary products, service, delivery and personal attention to detail. I look forward to doing business with you for many more years to come. Ross Perot Dallas, Texas We love The Gallery of the Republic. As Fifth Generation Texans, Texas history is important to us. The Gallery has helped us acquire many beautiful maps of great significance in Texas history. We love working with the folks at the gallery and will continue to work with them to add to our valuable and important collection. Nancy Ebe As a “born and raised” multi generational and hard core devout true Texan, I am proud to have found the Gallery of the Republic! The unique documents, maps, hand crafted historic flags and memorabilia are not only distinctive elegant accent pieces but are true heirlooms of appreciating value. I am enamored with the historical documents that I own, as are the friends and family that I have gifted items from the Gallery. I highly recommend a visit to the Gallery of the Republic…regardless of where you are from!!! Duncan Burkholder, MD We have accolades from our customers when they walk in our lobby and community suite. I think the historic items have been a grand slam! Bob Barnes IBC Bank The addition of the historic Texas flags to the Montgomery County Sherriff’s Administration office was a perfect personal touch. Montgomery County is recognized as the birthplace of the Texas flag and it is an honor to display the various renditions of the flag as well as an accompanying description of each piece. We are honored to celebrate our 180th year as a Texas County and we now proudly display emblems of our heritage in our office. I highly recommend your talents to anyone who desires to promote Texas history and heritage in their professional office settings.
