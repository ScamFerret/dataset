Starting with over 5,000 yards of antique fabrics including feedsacks, dress rayons and crazy quilt fabrics as well as quilting cottons from the 1850's through the early 2000's, new fabrics are added to the website on a regular basis. This venture started when The Kirk Collection decided to sell its antique fabric collection nearly 20 years ago. As a result of purchasing a large collection from an avid quilter, in addition to antique fabric, the collection included a large quantity of fabric from the 1980's to early 2000's. If you have special needs or a fabric emergency, feel free to call or send an email, and we will search the collection for the fabric you need, whether you are finishing a treasured family heirloom, putting together costumes for a film or stage production or dressing a special doll. The best way to contact us is via email at antiquefabric@gmail.com or 208-921-6603.
