PPMs and TDS use different conversion factors based on the meter. I think there are 3 different conversion factors. So it's hard to talk ppm and tds with growers as their meters are usually different. \\n\\nSo to answer the question in terms of EC\\nCheck out: https://www.food4plants.com/collections/recipes\\nYou can grow amazing plants with these values. Tweaking per commodity is usually done on a grower basis in hydroponics and especially soil. Almost all fruits and veggies will kick but with these EC values on that page. Many years of experience to back that claim up. \\n\\n\\nThat will help show the basics. For example tomatoes need higher N in flower because they continue to grow as they set fruit. \\nBeans need lots of N all the way through. They are a huge bush!\\nPeppers love lost of N in the beginning, then once they set fruit, drop the N by 30% and feed higher amounts of K. They like like 240 ppm N in Veg and like 150-160 in flower with 250-300 ppm K.\", \"I think it's weird that many sites list ppm as \\na mass basis,  not  molar quantity basis.\", 'First you need to know what standard the sources are using since one (I think the EU one) only goes up to 1100ish while the US (maybe) standard goes to like 1500-1700 so make sure you know which one the info is referring too, it looks like you have some from both ppm standard which is why you are confused since the different numbers mean the same thing', '[deleted]']}]"
