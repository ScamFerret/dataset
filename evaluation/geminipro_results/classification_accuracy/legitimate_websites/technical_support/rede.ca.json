On a normal ability I could understand there being a tradeoff to have to work around, but on an ultimate it just feels dated.\\n\\nThe explanation for it not working in the past was that something about the way the game handles dead champions prevented it from happening.

It also makes locked camera override its target to lock to the corpse instead.\\n\\nWhich isn\\'t to say that Lee ult **couldn\\'t** do this, but it\\'s a bit more involved than just saying \"do the dash even if they died\".\\n\\nSion E does a similar sort of faking by just not letting the minion die from the initial E hit, although this allows for other things to steal the kill mid-flight (some due to bugs, some not) and also results in the kill being delayed as a whole (which would matter for reset champs).\\n\\nIt\\'s also possible they could abuse zombie states as those fully count as a kill immediately yet are still able to dash (although in Mundo E\\'s case, it chooses not to dash Karthus/Kog\\'Maw/Sion becoming zombies, which Lee ult might also want to copy), but at that point it seems more worthwhile to investigate systemically allowing a dash to continue through death (zombies tend to make everything complicated).', 'League of Spaghetti is not al dente enough for stuff like that', 'Hmm.

Motor oil that is at operating temperature and hasn't been broken down allows the metal surfaces inside the engine to almost never touch. The wear goes into the oil and not the metal, the former being much easier to replace than the latter.\\n\\nWhen an engine is shut off, the oil is still hot (typical operating temperature is 205°F-220°F depending on the manufacturer/design) and it's continuing to drip and cover all of the metal surfaces such as the pistons, valve springs, etc etc. Starting the engine in this state causes very, very little wear as again, it's the oil taking the wear and not the metal.\\n\\nCold, winter starts are when the engine takes the most wear, when the oil is most viscous. Start/Stop systems typically do not kick in when they detect the engine is not at operating temperature or power needs exceed a certain threshold.\", '[deleted]', \"What wears an ICE engine is thermal cycles, that is warming it up, cooling it down, and warming it up again. If you start an engine that is already warm, there is very little wear. The wear comes from starting a cold engine that has been sitting for a while.\\n\\nTake an example, have you ever pulled the starter cord on a cold weed whacker / weedeater, or similar small engine? When it is cold, it is relatively hard to pull that cord, and you have to yank it a bunch of times. Now, run the engine for a while and turn it off. Wait about a minute and start it again. It is way easier when the engine is warm, and you usually get it on the first pull.\\n\\nThe reason the wear is worse on a cold engine that has been sitting for a while is that the oil and everything that lubricates the engine has cooled and settled. For that bit of time where you are starting the cold engine, you aren't getting good lubrication. That is where the engine wear occurs. It can be so bad (the bad lubrication) where the seals and gaskets haven't seen lubrication in so long they lose their pliability, then a cold start blows out the motor on the spot. The example I am thinking of is a generator that hadn't been run in a number of years that was clicked on during a power outage that promptly spewed all of its oil and what not all over the floor. \\n\\nNow, lets be honest, in a consumer vehicle with a liquid cooled engine, you are unlikely to get to the point where you will wear the engine so badly that you need to overhaul or rebuild. Engines that drive across the continent (truck diesels), or airplane piston engines, will see use that will require an overhaul/rebuild. You would have to start/stop excessively to match the kind of wear you get on a truck or airplane engine. Airplane engines because they are air cooled and the thermal cycles are rather extreme, and truck engines because they are massive and used for many times more driving miles than your typical car or SUV ICE.\", '[removed]', \"They simply put in more robust starter motors so they can handle it. Once the engine is warmed up, stopping it for a minute or so then starting it back up won't damage anything.\"]}]"
