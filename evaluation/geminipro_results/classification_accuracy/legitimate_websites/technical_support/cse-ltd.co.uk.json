HealthPartners International HealthPartners International have worked with CSE for over 15 years, we have found them helpful and responsive to our needs.  They have developed a good understanding of our business and are always able to offer IT solutions to any challenge presented to them. FPR Group Customer Service Excellence is another way to describe CSE - professional, friendly and always willing to go the extra mile! Bio Productions We have used CSE for all our IT Support needs for the last 7 years or so. They have always been quick to answer the phone and fast to respond to our problems. The reason we keep using CSE is mainly that when they come to visit they speak to us like people and not idiots the way many other IT companies do, it goes a long way when the engineers take an extra 5 minutes to explain in English what the problem / solution is. I would have no hesitation in recommending CSE to any business. The Cruise Line We have worked with CSE for over 10 years, we have always found their service to be top class, our calls are always answered straight away and any major problems we've had (not related to CSE!) have been dealt with in a timely manner, by friendly and professional staff. We as a company The Cruise Line ltd would have no problem in recommending their services to any other business's. 10/10 well done, keep up the good work. Renovo International Excellent company with first class staff who when in consultation have always had the time to listen to us meeting our IT support requirements and needs. Allowing Renovo International  to remain efficient competitive and productive."
