Call the SALES HOTLINE +44 (0)1296 398085 Industry leading Iris ID Iris Recognition Technology The use of the iris for recognition and identification of an individual remains the industry leading biometric for accuracy, ease of use and the preferred choice of biometric identification in a range of applications. Coronavirus is here to stay! As the COVID-19 pandemic changes our lives forever, so will the reliance on “Contactless” Access Control and Time and Attendance systems migrating from Keys, Cards and Codes to safer COVID-19 Compliant solutions employing Iris Identification Iris-based authentication is also contactless. And it is also not impacted by PPE — including tinted glasses or contact lenses. Using the iris to identify people complies with the COVID-19 guidelines and also eliminates the potential spreading of disease while still maintaining security protocols. Aditech and its partners have devised such solutions based on our range of reliable, accurate, tried and tested devices, flexible solutions that can be applied to many sensitive applications and in most environments.  We have produced a series of articles focused on the compliance requirements within various industry settings and how Iris Identification and Recognition technology can help.

GET IN TOUCH Iris Recognition Identifies: The complex nature and structure of the Iris pattern, the coloured part of the eye surrounding the pupil, provides the most distinctive visible feature of the human body which is stable throughout the life of an individual so a person only needs to be enrolled once. The ability for true one-to-many identification enables the iris technology to be readily accepted where the need for true identity authentication of an individual is paramount. Iris Recognition Myths Iris detection, recognition or identification is sometimes referred to as iris scanning, there is no scanning of the eye as is sometimes presumed merely a photographic image is captured for processing by the software. Iris detection or recognition is not retina scanning, the retina is at the back of the eye unlike the iris which is visible.
