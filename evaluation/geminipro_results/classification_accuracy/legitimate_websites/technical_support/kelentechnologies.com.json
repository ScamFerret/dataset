I hate the \"new\" Improved Production/Efficiencies of Scale/Maximized Productivity technology line, because they can make things less efficient in the long run.\\n\\nFor those who don\\'t know the tech increases all job outputs up to 30% depending on how advanced you capital building is, but it also increase the job upkeep by 30%.\\n\\nSo the tech provides an equal drawback for its benefit, right? WRONG!\\n\\nLet me acquaint you with Stellaris additive modifier system. A common mistake of newer players it to believe that if something says \"x increased by 10%\" that x has actually increased by 10%. But let me show you an example.\\n\\nImagine you start a new game and have the capital designation bonus  (+10%), with the intelligent trait (+10% again) and have researched the first two levels of the research improvement techs (+40%). Question: how much does the intelligent trait improve the research? The naive and wrong answer is 10% the real answer is 6.7%. The reason is that the boni are applied additive that means that intelligent increase the research from 150% to 160% and not to 165% if the bonus would be multiplicative.\\n\\nYou might now already know what is about to happen if you apply the \"improved\" production tech line. The 30% will be much lower than advertised, especially in the late game, when you get boni like high level governors, ecumenopolis, planetary super computer, leader boni from the three ascension paths and so on. \\n\\nBut the 30% more upkeep are actually 30% more upkeep because there are very few upkeep increases and many of them increase the base upkeep (for example the research edict) which makes the 30% multiplicative! Even worse if you took the discovery tradition than your penalty is even higher because you increase you upkeep from 80% to 110% which is a 37.5% increase!!! \\n\\nIn conclusion, this game is unplayable and I hate it! I might play hive minds later.\\n\\nEdit: I know my claim is not entirely correct, some people brought up valid criticism. In most situation the tech will be positive but there are some very nich situations in which the tech could be detrimental.\\n\\nOne thing is true though the tech is not as good as it appears. Someone did a reason calculation and showed that in terms of pop efficiency the tech provides about 10% increase in a normal playthrough.', 'comments': ['[removed]', 'i love how every single time you wrote bonis', \"Mathematically, you're of course correct, but this is missing some context. Realistically, only two things matter in regards to resource production: How much you make in total (to spend on ships and buildings and all that) and whether you are covering your upkeep. You are looking at the efficiency of a single pop, but not at the entire production line and total output.\\n\\nIn short, pop efficiency lets you shift more pops towards specialists, so resource consumers. A higher *ratio* of scientists and metallurgists and all that, which certainly is desireable since pops are limited. The capital productivity, since it also affects the jobs making the resources to be consumed by others, enables you to do more with less overall pops (even though yes, efficiency drops slightly and you need to shift a little towards workers). This is without considering that it lets you reduce the number of certain jobs like farmers whose output isn't consumed by the increased upkeep or that it's the biggest single source of metallurgist output boost (that I can think of).\\n\\nAs pops aren't infinite, this is still an overall boon to your empire in terms of absolute resource output compared to your number of pops. Which was exactly the point when it was introduced.\", \"It's about efficiency vs effectiveness. The 30% increase in both upkeep and production can be viewed as having a pop with regular bonuses plus 0.3 pops with default values. So basically the question is if those 0.3 pops are too inefficient and they're holding you back or if they're just more pops that you can use.\", 'sorry, but my brain gridlocks at additive and multiplikative... a little explanation for non-math-nerds and people to lazy to look it up them selfs?']}, {'title': 'Is this a scam?
