Detailed Features Smart Grid of Orders A grid of orders, which the bot places on the exchange, is used for trading. Volume of Orders The volume of orders in a grid is determined by the Martingale system. The first order in the grid is the smallest in volume and the closest to the current exchange price. Each subsequent order in the grid is larger in volume than the previous one and farther from the current exchange price. In addition, the volume of orders in the grid can be adjusted manually by specifying the percentage of the total deposit allocated to the crypto trading bot. Grid of Order Prices Order prices in the grid are distributed according to the percentage of price change overlap specified in the crypto trading bot settings. The distribution of prices can be linear or logarithmic. In the linear distribution, the order prices are at the same distance from each other throughout the price change overlap. The logarithmic price distribution sets a higher density of orders at the current price on the exchange, in order to involve more of the deposit in the trade at low volatility. Notifications and Bot Operation Reports Stay tuned for the main crypto bot operation events. Set your notifications and stay in touch with the conducted transactions and the profits you have made by trading with bots.

Volatility Indicators and Trading Signals It’s important to choose the right trading pairs with good volatility to gain more trading revenue with RevenueBot. For this purpose, the crypto bot evaluates volatility indicators and trading signals (RSI, CCI, Bollinger Bands) in every trading pair present on the exchange. Bot Operation Simulation (backtests) Examine the bot’s last 60 days of operation simulation in any of the trading pairs to choose the best operation settings. Try different settings and the automated trading bot will show how it would have traded in a period of time set in the past, with real price volatility schemes and with a virtual deposit. This will help determine the best robot operation settings for an exact crypto trading pair. Cryptocurrency Futures Trading with Leverage Using leverage allows you to open large positions with minimal investment. You can use leverage up to x125 for some trading pairs.
