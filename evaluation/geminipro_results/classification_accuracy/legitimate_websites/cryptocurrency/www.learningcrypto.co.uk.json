When did Learning:Crypto start in Cryptocurrency?   Ash, our founder started in cryptocurrency in 2016, started educating on Facebook in 2017 and formed the company in 2018.

Within Premium we offer over 36 hours worth of online course from Beginner Investing, Technical Analysis and Psychological courses. Is cryptocurrency safe? With the right security measures, such as using reputable wallets and two-factor authentication, it can be safe. We will not DM you asking you to put money into anything. Is cryptocurrency like stocks and shares? No, even though it has a speculated value and you can do technical analysis on them, stocks and shares have more value elements that creates a stock price, cryptocurrency does not. What is blockchain? A decentralized digital ledger that records cryptocurrency transactions across multiple computers. Blockchains come in many different ways which you'll learn in our courses. I want to trade, do you recommend this for beginners? Most of the time, most people want to trade, we feel if you want to you can, but do our technical analysis course first and start with a demo account to master your strategy. Will I be successful?
