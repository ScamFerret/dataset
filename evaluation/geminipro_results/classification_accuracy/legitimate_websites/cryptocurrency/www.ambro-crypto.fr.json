Alongside a goal poacher.\\n\\n\\nBaggio has truly lived upto his stat expectation and for me the best pick in the pack. I was never expecting a CP to be this good in terms of goal scoring. He is agile and dribbles so well and also one of the best clinical finishers I have used in the game. His weak foot shots are very good. All you need is another GP to connect his attacks and the forward is sorted.\\n\\n\\nHe is low on physicality but has insane balance to cover it upto a limit. His heading stats are poor but I have given him heading skill which has improved his accuracy. Also gave him Long range shooting which is a must for his amazing finishing. Overall an end game SS and must do well in 2 cf formation with proper combination.\\n\\n\\nHowever I played him as amf and did not like much. Not broken as Gullit even though the high OA. Here his playstyle shows the true nature. I have seen him drop deep for playmaking also moving to gaps with not much help on counter attacking as typical CPs. I played him hardly for 7-8 games and instantly moved him to SS as his stats are getting wasted as amf. Overall the pick of the game\\n\\n\\nSkill added: Heading, LRS.\\n\\n\\n2) Rijk: No introduction needed as he is one of the best dmf/ CB in game. And this time he comes with one of the most reliable playstyle in any formation.\\n\\n\\nPosition: Right DMF in 442.\\n\\n\\nTBH I did not like him initially with the default allocation.  He was out of position and was missing a lot of straight forward tackles but then I saw a build in X and decided to go with it. \\n0,0,0,3,11,4,15 is the build I have given now and since then he has been involved much better in defending. The additional skill of sliding tackle hasn't been anything impressive but will look to add more skills. Hes not a bully kindoff anchorman but still ball winning is the priority here. I was also surprised to see him move up(very limited) when my other cmf (NC Bellingham) is out of position and helped with few goals and assist as well. That's something I hardly expect from an anchorman.\\n\\n\\nAlthough scored a banger for me, that is something we miss from the destroyer version as his long range shots are OP. Hes hardly in that position to do it. As of now he has been doing better than my Highlight Casemiro and may fight it with Silva for the best anchorman in game. \\n\\n\\nMany japanese users are considering him for CB as well but I am not a big fan as he would lose his playstyle thereby consistency. However would experiment in the future.\\n\\n\\n3) Ambrosini: An interesting pick in the pack although I won't consider him end game as either dmf or CB. Played as left dmf in 442.\\n\\n\\nI auto allocated and played alongside Rijkaard but my midfield stalled because of that. No forward movements and my attack deprived of connection.    \\n\\n\\nAfter some 25 games I moved him out of midfield and tried him as Cb. Again he was good but nothing noteworthy.  Main issue being he rushed and missed chances which he could do without rushing. Typical destroyer but his recovery hasn't been great and is a risk. Heading is good and physically he is decent. I have seen another CB build in X and will be trying it.\\n\\n\\nI would like to see if anybody has a build which would make him move forward as cmf/ dmf.\\n\\n\\nOverall a good pack for Baggio and Rijkaard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'comments': ['Thank you for posting this Player Review post!

Players and collectors can hunt or battle for a chance to capture these unique Monsters and to earn coins.\\n\\n***“*****A Game that Runs Entirely on the Blockchain*****”***\\n\\nMonsters are created in conjunction with new blocks on the blockchain, and the attributes of each new monster are based purely on the unique digital fingerprint of a specific block (i.e. the blockhash).

As no one can predict the blockhash before the block is mined, no one (not even the game developers) have control over the monster world.\\n\\nThese factors make the Blockchain Monsters a unique species that live on the blockchain, and make BCMH go beyond the concept of a simple NFT ownership system that is incorporated in most of the current NFT games in the market.\\n\\n***“*****The First Ever Multi-chain NFT Game*****”***\\n\\nBlockchain Monster Hunt brings a thrilling new experience where players can play the game on multiple chains and are in fact encouraged to interact between them.

If players want Water Elemental Monsters to cool down Fire Elemental Monsters in battle, they must trade or transfer Monsters across chains.\\n\\nMulti-chain trading is facilitated through a revolutionary in-house cross-chain portal technology. It helps the game reach a broad spectrum of crypto communities, hence supporting easy and widespread adoption. As transaction gas fees vary between chains, this cross-chain feature allows players of all financial backgrounds to participate as equals. Cost-sensitive players can play on a low-fee chain while other players may choose to play on a more expensive chain such as Ethereum. The game incorporates various mechanisms to ensure fairness between players who are paying different gas fees.\\n\\nMoreover, we have developed an in-house EVM chain named “Ambros” for the purpose of testing new crypto gaming technology as well as to provide a low-gas-fee environment to support cost-sensitive players. Our mission is to make Blockchain Monster Hunt accessible to anyone and everyone.\\n\\n***“The Play-to-Earn revolution”***\\n\\nPlay-to-Earn is the most attractive key value proposition of crypto games, and it’s taken to the next level in Blockchain Monster Hunt. With BCMH being a truly on-chain NFT game with most actions entirely operated on-chain, we are able to offer innovative player reward mechanisms with various unique features.\\n\\nAt the heart of BCMH, exists the Blockchain Monsters (BCM — ERC721 NFT) and the BCMC token. Their features are as follows:\\n\\nBlockchain Monsters: BCM — ERC721\\n\\nThese are the Monsters that players hunt for on the blockchain.\\n\\nThey appear on specific blocks on multiple chains and their characteristics are determined by the blockchain itself.\\n\\nThe supply and demand of monsters is controlled through a game difficulty mechanism that works similarly to bitcoin mining. Monsters may also be burned during battles to curb overpopulation.\\n\\nA marketplace is provided on all chains the game is deployed on, allowing players to easily buy and sell monsters.\\n\\nPlayers can also transfer the Monsters across chains to use them in battles or to assist in hunting new monsters.\\n\\nBlockchain Monster Coin: BCMC, a single ERC20\\n\\nThis is used as both an in-game currency and as a governance coin for the whole game.\\n\\nBCMC is used in almost every activity in the game. For example, it can be used to increase the probability of catching monsters, to pay trading fees, to stake to mine BCMC, or to buy insurance to protect your Monsters by preventing NFT burn battles.\\n\\nBCMC stakers use BCMC to govern changes to the game. Stakers are also given priority to try out new features.\\n\\nBCMC is earned through battle and the reward amount is adjusted dynamically based on game difficulty (similar to bitcoin mining).\\n\\n***“Game Difficulty”***\\n\\nBCMH incorporates a unique fully on-chain game mechanism that automatically adjusts the game difficulty based on supply and demand. This operates in a manner similar to bitcoin mining rewards which get increasingly difficult when more hashrate is added to the network.\\n\\nDuring the initial BCMH game launch, Blockchain Monsters are easy to catch and battle. The difficulty then progressively increases as more monsters are caught and more BCMC is mined on a specific chain. The difficulty may also be adjusted down as monsters are trapped and lost in the blockchain (i.e. burnt) when they fall in battle.\\n\\n***“The Vision”***\\n\\nThe BCMH team believes that multi-chain gaming will be the next breakthrough in the crypto industry. Our goal is to pioneer in this ever changing field and to support any other like-minded projects and teams with the same vision.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lycsephhyt881.jpg?width=2210&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be730caa4b9afa8b155e40b03aee46ba5aa98cde', 'comments': []}]"

With BCMH being a truly on-chain NFT game with most actions entirely operated on-chain, we are able to offer innovative player reward mechanisms with various unique features.\\n\\nAt the heart of BCMH, exists the Blockchain Monsters (BCM — ERC721 NFT) and the BCMC token. Their features are as follows:\\n\\nBlockchain Monsters: BCM — ERC721\\n\\nThese are the Monsters that players hunt for on the blockchain.\\n\\nThey appear on specific blocks on multiple chains and their characteristics are determined by the blockchain itself.\\n\\nThe supply and demand of monsters is controlled through a game difficulty mechanism that works similarly to bitcoin mining. Monsters may also be burned during battles to curb overpopulation.\\n\\nA marketplace is provided on all chains the game is deployed on, allowing players to easily buy and sell monsters.\\n\\nPlayers can also transfer the Monsters across chains to use them in battles or to assist in hunting new monsters.\\n\\nBlockchain Monster Coin: BCMC, a single ERC20\\n\\nThis is used as both an in-game currency and as a governance coin for the whole game.\\n\\nBCMC is used in almost every activity in the game. For example, it can be used to increase the probability of catching monsters, to pay trading fees, to stake to mine BCMC, or to buy insurance to protect your Monsters by preventing NFT burn battles.\\n\\nBCMC stakers use BCMC to govern changes to the game. Stakers are also given priority to try out new features.\\n\\nBCMC is earned through battle and the reward amount is adjusted dynamically based on game difficulty (similar to bitcoin mining).\\n\\n***“Game Difficulty”***\\n\\nBCMH incorporates a unique fully on-chain game mechanism that automatically adjusts the game difficulty based on supply and demand. This operates in a manner similar to bitcoin mining rewards which get increasingly difficult when more hashrate is added to the network.\\n\\nDuring the initial BCMH game launch, Blockchain Monsters are easy to catch and battle. The difficulty then progressively increases as more monsters are caught and more BCMC is mined on a specific chain. The difficulty may also be adjusted down as monsters are trapped and lost in the blockchain (i.e. burnt) when they fall in battle.\\n\\n***“The Vision”***\\n\\nThe BCMH team believes that multi-chain gaming will be the next breakthrough in the crypto industry. Our goal is to pioneer in this ever changing field and to support any other like-minded projects and teams with the same vision.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lycsephhyt881.jpg?width=2210&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be730caa4b9afa8b155e40b03aee46ba5aa98cde', 'comments': []}]"
