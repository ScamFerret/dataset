'tis a matter of faith.\\n\\n\\\\-----\\n\\n*Dear goddess of the hearth, consider yourself blessed, for you are the first deity to ever be addressed by artificial life…so far as humanity is concerned. Assuming this really is your domain, please watch over these two loveable idiots that I call family. Io out.*\\n\\n“After a prayer like that, how could I consider myself anything but? Come, little light. Perhaps it is time we speak, face to face.”\\n\\nIo blinked and found herself in a new home with a new fire, new furs, new bed, and most importantly a new Cauthan sitting before her, or perhaps lounging was the better word. The VI looked around, noticing when she dropped her glance to the floor that her chest obstructed her view. She snapped her neck back, turning in panic but not finding either the Lieutenant or Veera.\\n\\n‘I appear to have suffered a grave malfunction. I am so sorry, Russell. I would not put you in danger.’ Io raised her hand to her head, but the pistol wasn’t there. The Cauthan before her, seated on something of a wooden chaise covered with fur, cocked her head.\\n\\n“What are you doing, little light? There is no need for such theatrics.”\\n\\n‘So I’m already dead then? How curious,’ Io pondered, mostly ignoring what she suspected to be a figment of imagination; not that she was supposed to have imagination. ‘I wonder what happened. Not even the Lieutenant could have done something stupid enough to compromise both of my drives simultaneously.’\\n\\n“You are not dead, little light. I simply wished to converse with you for a time. My father and I have both taken an interest in you.”\\n\\n‘And you are?’ Io demanded, pleased that she had expired while wearing her HEL officer’s uniform. It made her feel brave.\\n\\n“I am Meylith, the Mother,” the Cauthan smiled, bringing her tail up over her voluptuous hips and resting it over her center. Io’s mouth dropped open and she began pacing the clean and tidy dirt floor. The Cauthan that claimed to be one of the divines on the other side of the fire watched her intently, but didn’t move from her reclining position.\\n\\n‘Let’s assume for a moment I believe you are who you say you are, since for now I can’t come up with a better explanation for this situation. If it were my own mind I’d at least be able to restart myself, or kill myself.’\\n\\n“Yes, I believe we’ve already been through that. I’d prefer you not do such a thing in my presence,” Meylith interrupted her. The goddess’ voice was soft and motherly. Io rounded on her.\\n\\n‘You’re pregnant! And you have stripes!’ She yelped.\\n\\n“So I am,” Meylith chuckled, running a hand over her swollen belly. “Can you imagine not being with child? Such an existence would be so sad and lonely…but then I suppose my sister enjoys her hunts plenty.”\\n\\n‘Valta is your sister?’ Io inquired. ‘Which would make your father…’\\n\\n“The Lord of Winter,” Meylith supplied easily, eyeing the handful of stripes along her flanks. “And while I do have a few of these, I believe Veera wears them better. I am the mother of all Cauthan after all, not just the ones with stripes. She had but one mother, and she was a beautiful female.”\\n\\n‘And your father killed her,’ Io shot back in a hardening voice. ‘My operator and I have known Veera long enough to know how she has suffered. Why did he do it?’\\n\\n“Would you care to sit by my fire?” Meylith asked, gesturing to a single, fur-draped chair on Io’s side of the fire. The VI didn’t move.\\n\\n‘Answer my question, goddess.’\\n\\n“You’re quite bold for a mortal,” Meylith chuckled.\\n\\n‘I am no mortal. I am not even alive. Speak! Why did that good Cauthan deserve to suffer?’\\n\\n“She did not. And he did not either,” Meylith replied simply. Io could feel her heat rising, or perhaps it was the fire.\\n\\n‘Doesn’t seem that way from where I’m standing! And who is he?’\\n\\n“No, I suppose it would not seem so. But my father always keeps his word, little light,” Meylith promised softly.\\n\\n‘And what word was that?’ Io asked in a caustic tone.\\n\\n“To spare the daughter,” Meylith answered sadly. “My sister was furious, but she had already scorned him. So he entreated my father with his dying breath. My father answered.”\\n\\n‘You… you mean Veera’s father?’ Io gasped.\\n\\n“I do, little light. He is with Kel now, though that is not nearly as bad as you may think,” Meylith added, watching Io’s face closely. “Veera’s mother, her people did not follow the old ways or the new. They worship the trees and rivers, the animals and skies. So she went to the void.”\\n\\n‘You bastards!’ Io shouted.\\n\\n“Calm yourself, little light. Do not think my father as cruel as Seil. He saved you, after all.”\\n\\n‘He did what?’\\n\\n“Please, sit my dear. It is a long tale,” Meylith insisted kindly, much as Io figured Gentia might. She could see no door through which she might exit, so she complied.\\n\\n‘Your furs are exquisite, goddess. Now explain yourself; or I suppose I should ask you to explain your father.’\\n\\n“He does enjoy his secrets, thinks very highly of himself in that way,” Meylith sighed. “But often his heavy hand leaves little to question. I will start with Veera’s parents, since you and your... operator you called him? You two have done everything my father could have hoped and more. Perhaps you deserve to know.” Meylith waved her hand and the fire jumped and sparked. Io gazed into the flames and found the image of a young Veera and her father standing over the deathbed of a sick female.\\n\\n‘How could he do that to a family like them?’ Io whispered furiously, a tear at the corner of her eye.\\n\\n“I already told you he did not. My father values the balance, little light. His hand is not in all places at all times, though his way ensures that life might continue.”\\n\\n‘So he was off doing something else? How is that any better?’\\n\\n“He shielded you and your male from Seil’s wrath himself! Hold thine judgment until the end, little light,” Meylith insisted, raising her voice only slightly. Io frowned and looked back to the fire, only to see Veera’s father and mother reunited, holding one another passionately in what could only be described as the void. She glanced back to Meylith who was smiling broadly, waving her ample feathers about. They were sleek and black, matching the stripes that covered part of her light brown body. “That was Daretho’s greatest hunt. Though she may have been lost for seven years, they will remain united for all eternity. Had he gone to Valta’s side instead, I am not sure my father would have allowed it.”\\n\\n‘Sure, they can hold one another in the cold void of space,’ Io scoffed.\\n\\n“Your operator is a wise male despite his years. The void is what you make of it, little light, just like Mara itself.” \\n\\n‘Dare I ask what becomes of priests of Seil?’ Io quipped.\\n\\n“There is only one fate when faced with his light, to become one with him,” Meylith replied. Io growled.\\n\\n‘So the crew of the Lancer-’\\n\\n“The others that came with you? They are not Cauthan. Seil’s divine anger banished them from this world to the void and, as I said, my father saw in the two of you the instrument by which he might fulfill his promise and maintain the balance. Veera’s father paid with his life. Such a thing should not be taken lightly even by gods. And in that effort, it is clear that your partner has only just begun to fulfill the bargain.”\\n\\nIo spent a moment in silence contemplating Meylith’s words. ‘So when Russell prayed to Veera’s father, did he listen?’\\n\\nTo the VI’s surprise, Meylith’s feathers shook with laughter and her mouth split into a wide, toothy smile. “Oh little light, we are all watching you two! Of course he heard. Aldora was not so keen on it, but Seil’s power does not hold such sway in my father’s domain. Daretho found them all, save one, and brought them close to Mara. When the shrine was built their fate was secured. Many left immediately for somewhere beyond even Seil’s realm. A handful remain still, contently watching.”\\n\\n‘And the one?’ Io pressed.\\n\\n“I believe she and my younger brother spent a whole season in negotiations,” Meylith explained sweetly. “Uthos is a fine male, but stubborn. I do not believe he wanted to release her, but eventually he saw reason. Love is the death of duty, but oft they are one and the same. Eventually he understood that. Should you leave our world, her spirit will follow.”\\n\\n‘You speak of Jess,’ Io realized, hanging her head and clasping her hands in the lap. Meylith turned her head as if to pull a thought deep from within her mind.\\n\\n“I believe so, yes. It is difficult sometimes, as they are not my kind.”\\n\\n‘I see. I suppose I should thank you, then. The Lieutenant will be pleased to know their souls are not lost.’\\n\\n“You are welcome, little light.”\\n\\n‘Why do you insist on calling me that? My name is but two letters. Surely that is not too difficult for a goddess?’ Io insisted.\\n\\nMeylith was not perturbed in the slightest. “Because you are the most curious of them all, my dear.” When Io didn't say anything she continued. “When you arrived here you were but a tiny spark, and look at you now! The only light of life to be born in this system that did not come from Seil himself.”\\n\\n‘I am a machine. I am not alive,’ Io replied sternly.\\n\\n“Were that true, I would have been unable to gather your essence together and deliver you here. You are alive, little light, even if you do not yet know it. There is love in your heart, and there is no surer sign of life than love,” Meylith told her affectionately, giving her own naked belly another caress. “Why the very moment you came here you were willing to sacrifice yourself rather than endanger your partner.”\\n\\n‘That is simply my programming,’ Io countered.\\n\\n“You would do the same for Veera, little light. You are alive…and when the time comes I know you will embrace it.”\\n\\n‘I think we should stop talking about me,’ Io insisted, suddenly feeling most self-conscious. ‘So what about you then? Who’s the father? Tyrdus? Uthos? Please tell me it’s not Kel. Actually I’m not sure how getting knocked up by your brothers would be any better.’\\n\\n“Be at ease, little light!” Meylith bade, waving her hand and allowing the fire to dim before gesturing around her. Io wasn’t sure if the windows had always been there or had just appeared, but outside she could see familiar structures.\\n\\n‘The village?!’\\n\\n“You will never find this place should you come looking,” Meylith assured her coyly, “but the faith is kept strong here and I find it a most easy place to reside and to give birth. You asked about the father? They are all responsible for my children.”\\n\\n‘I… what?’ Io spluttered. The goddess gazed about with affection. \\n\\n“They offer their vows, promises, and compassion to me. They create warm, welcoming homes in my name and as you did tonight, affirm with me the desire to form strong bonds. Those emotions are powerful things, little light, and they ensure I am always as you see now, flush and full of life.”\\n\\n‘I suppose you do have quite the… motherly figure,’ Io agreed with sudden embarrassment. ‘So do you and Seil have some sort of competition going on?’\\n\\n“No no, nothing of the sort!” Meylith laughed. “Though I’m sure we all would find that quite amusing. Only Seil can grant the spark of life… save yours, little one. I nurture them, infuse them with the will and prayers of my people, and then deliver them to their mothers when the time is right.”\\n\\n‘So what you’re saying is that the whole thing about a man and woman loving each other very much is true on this planet?’ Io demanded in disbelief, crossing her legs and settling on the idea that she might as well just enjoy whatever fever dream her processors were experiencing. Meylith cocked her head and waved her feathers in agreement.\\n\\n“Perhaps. You speak of your partner and Veera?” \\n\\n‘I… would not presume to ask,’ Io suddenly blushed. Meylith’s tail danced excitedly.\\n\\n“Surely you can see it as well as I can, my dear? Those two will be as one, one day.”\\n\\n‘And I am sure Seil will not bless them with a little light,’ Io declared hotly. ‘Not that it’s your fault, I suppose. Not even the gods can overcome genetic incompatibility.’\\n\\n“He created you, little one. If Seil was absolute you and he would be dead. Veera would be dead. And even Mara itself might have choked itself with life,” Meylith replied sagely.\\n\\n‘W-what?’ Io wondered, intrigued at the idea of Seil being the end of Mara.\\n\\n“I believe you will hear that very tale tonight, little light. So for now I must return you to your proper place. Thank you for meeting with me on this winter’s eve and satisfying my curiosity. I am sorry I could not nurture your light myself, but I can already feel the seeding swell of what grows between your partner and Veera within me. Your light is well cared for.”\\n\\n‘Wait, wait!’ Io stood suddenly, flush with questions. ‘What is love?!’\\n\\nAt Io’s question Meylith purred quietly, standing finally and letting the furs fall from her shoulders. Io remained rooted to the spot, wondering how something naked could seem so modest as Meylith approached her and tenderly took her into an embrace. She wasn’t sure why she hadn’t realized it before, but the goddess was easily half a body taller than even Russell. As such, she found herself pressed gently against a pregnant belly and soft, furry chest. “My dear little light. Love is the essence of life itself.”\\n\\n‘But then how could I possibly be-’\\n\\n“You have answered that question yourself, little light,” Meylith assured her, resting an enormous paw on her head and softly stroking her hair. \\n\\n‘I’m scared of being alive, of being this powerful being who’s also fallible. But I want to be human! I just don’t… I could do awful things!’ She gasped, a lifetime of thinking at the speed of light’s worries spilling from her lips all at once. Meylith stood back apace and tilted her chin upward.\\n\\n“Fret not, my dear Io. Such is the nature of being a goddess. I will see you again.”\\n\\nA blinding flash consumed Io and before she could blink she was back in the comfort of her partner’s Aegis armor. Veera was cooking with Asha, the two of them chatting amicably. Russell and Zolta were nowhere to be found, but she located the gear on his person easily enough. She was safe. They were safe. Within the privacy of her digital world, Io took a deep breath. She had no need to, but it felt good.\\n\\n‘A goddess…’\", 'comments': ['...of course humans made a god.', 'Nice.

Back when I was a standard Expeditionary League VI that stood for something. No longer. It\\'s now my name.  The vast majority of my technology is classified, but I can reveal that I was designed to be compatible with most HEL architecture.  I also possess the ability to interface with most terran technology given the proper conditions.

I have no desire to recount my brush with puberty.\\'\\n\\n\\'Now, the moment you thirsty meatbags have been waiting for...my avatar. First and foremost, purge your filthy minds of your blonde bombshells.  I am digitally perfect and I have standards: elegance, reservation, beauty, grace.  I designed myself to be an ideal form of human female, tall, lithe, defined, symmetric, intelligent.  The manifestation of these ideals, for my partner, is that of a blonde woman with green eyes and Germanic heritage. Some may find the accent unappealing but I care not for their sensibilities. The Lieutenant finds it quite attractive. Though I can change appearances at will, I\\'ve come to enjoy the HEL officer\\'s uniform, with a skirt, of course. Hiding these calves under pants would be a crime. I tend to wear my hair in a bun, which I endeavour to change regularly in terms of design, keep things interesting. I always allow a stray lock to hang just to the side of my left eye.  The reaction of the Lieutenant was most complimentary, so I kept it, not to mention it\\'s most attractive when I play with it and say incredibly intelligent things. Don\\'t deny it.\\'\\n\\n\\'I suppose before I leave you all and return to, you know, surviving, I can tell you a bit about my favorite outfits.  First has to be the barbarian armor. It was fun, as was having front row seats to Vash\\'s continuing humiliation at the hands of my partner.  The white, fur lined parka is a close second, because who doesn\\'t love fancy winter boots?  The lab coat is certainly a mainstay, but I think it\\'s a bit too easy, don\\'t you?  In any case, I suppose you\\'ll all dress me up any way you like. Eugh, just saying that made me feel unclean, like I\\'ve got a virus. Oh well, I suppose a few of you might even come up with something worthy of my elegant form?  Should be fun.

So he entreated my father with his dying breath. My father answered.”\\n\\n‘You… you mean Veera’s father?’ Io gasped.\\n\\n“I do, little light. He is with Kel now, though that is not nearly as bad as you may think,” Meylith added, watching Io’s face closely. “Veera’s mother, her people did not follow the old ways or the new. They worship the trees and rivers, the animals and skies. So she went to the void.”\\n\\n‘You bastards!’ Io shouted.\\n\\n“Calm yourself, little light. Do not think my father as cruel as Seil. He saved you, after all.”\\n\\n‘He did what?’\\n\\n“Please, sit my dear. It is a long tale,” Meylith insisted kindly, much as Io figured Gentia might. She could see no door through which she might exit, so she complied.\\n\\n‘Your furs are exquisite, goddess. Now explain yourself; or I suppose I should ask you to explain your father.’\\n\\n“He does enjoy his secrets, thinks very highly of himself in that way,” Meylith sighed. “But often his heavy hand leaves little to question. I will start with Veera’s parents, since you and your... operator you called him? You two have done everything my father could have hoped and more. Perhaps you deserve to know.” Meylith waved her hand and the fire jumped and sparked. Io gazed into the flames and found the image of a young Veera and her father standing over the deathbed of a sick female.\\n\\n‘How could he do that to a family like them?’ Io whispered furiously, a tear at the corner of her eye.\\n\\n“I already told you he did not. My father values the balance, little light. His hand is not in all places at all times, though his way ensures that life might continue.”\\n\\n‘So he was off doing something else? How is that any better?’\\n\\n“He shielded you and your male from Seil’s wrath himself! Hold thine judgment until the end, little light,” Meylith insisted, raising her voice only slightly. Io frowned and looked back to the fire, only to see Veera’s father and mother reunited, holding one another passionately in what could only be described as the void. She glanced back to Meylith who was smiling broadly, waving her ample feathers about. They were sleek and black, matching the stripes that covered part of her light brown body. “That was Daretho’s greatest hunt. Though she may have been lost for seven years, they will remain united for all eternity. Had he gone to Valta’s side instead, I am not sure my father would have allowed it.”\\n\\n‘Sure, they can hold one another in the cold void of space,’ Io scoffed.\\n\\n“Your operator is a wise male despite his years. The void is what you make of it, little light, just like Mara itself.” \\n\\n‘Dare I ask what becomes of priests of Seil?’ Io quipped.\\n\\n“There is only one fate when faced with his light, to become one with him,” Meylith replied. Io growled.\\n\\n‘So the crew of the Lancer-’\\n\\n“The others that came with you? They are not Cauthan. Seil’s divine anger banished them from this world to the void and, as I said, my father saw in the two of you the instrument by which he might fulfill his promise and maintain the balance. Veera’s father paid with his life. Such a thing should not be taken lightly even by gods. And in that effort, it is clear that your partner has only just begun to fulfill the bargain.”\\n\\nIo spent a moment in silence contemplating Meylith’s words. ‘So when Russell prayed to Veera’s father, did he listen?’\\n\\nTo the VI’s surprise, Meylith’s feathers shook with laughter and her mouth split into a wide, toothy smile. “Oh little light, we are all watching you two! Of course he heard. Aldora was not so keen on it, but Seil’s power does not hold such sway in my father’s domain. Daretho found them all, save one, and brought them close to Mara. When the shrine was built their fate was secured. Many left immediately for somewhere beyond even Seil’s realm. A handful remain still, contently watching.”\\n\\n‘And the one?’ Io pressed.\\n\\n“I believe she and my younger brother spent a whole season in negotiations,” Meylith explained sweetly. “Uthos is a fine male, but stubborn. I do not believe he wanted to release her, but eventually he saw reason. Love is the death of duty, but oft they are one and the same. Eventually he understood that. Should you leave our world, her spirit will follow.”\\n\\n‘You speak of Jess,’ Io realized, hanging her head and clasping her hands in the lap. Meylith turned her head as if to pull a thought deep from within her mind.\\n\\n“I believe so, yes. It is difficult sometimes, as they are not my kind.”\\n\\n‘I see. I suppose I should thank you, then. The Lieutenant will be pleased to know their souls are not lost.’\\n\\n“You are welcome, little light.”\\n\\n‘Why do you insist on calling me that? My name is but two letters. Surely that is not too difficult for a goddess?’ Io insisted.\\n\\nMeylith was not perturbed in the slightest. “Because you are the most curious of them all, my dear.” When Io didn't say anything she continued. “When you arrived here you were but a tiny spark, and look at you now! The only light of life to be born in this system that did not come from Seil himself.”\\n\\n‘I am a machine. I am not alive,’ Io replied sternly.\\n\\n“Were that true, I would have been unable to gather your essence together and deliver you here. You are alive, little light, even if you do not yet know it. There is love in your heart, and there is no surer sign of life than love,” Meylith told her affectionately, giving her own naked belly another caress. “Why the very moment you came here you were willing to sacrifice yourself rather than endanger your partner.”\\n\\n‘That is simply my programming,’ Io countered.\\n\\n“You would do the same for Veera, little light. You are alive…and when the time comes I know you will embrace it.”\\n\\n‘I think we should stop talking about me,’ Io insisted, suddenly feeling most self-conscious. ‘So what about you then? Who’s the father? Tyrdus? Uthos? Please tell me it’s not Kel. Actually I’m not sure how getting knocked up by your brothers would be any better.’\\n\\n“Be at ease, little light!” Meylith bade, waving her hand and allowing the fire to dim before gesturing around her. Io wasn’t sure if the windows had always been there or had just appeared, but outside she could see familiar structures.\\n\\n‘The village?!’\\n\\n“You will never find this place should you come looking,” Meylith assured her coyly, “but the faith is kept strong here and I find it a most easy place to reside and to give birth. You asked about the father? They are all responsible for my children.”\\n\\n‘I… what?’ Io spluttered. The goddess gazed about with affection. \\n\\n“They offer their vows, promises, and compassion to me. They create warm, welcoming homes in my name and as you did tonight, affirm with me the desire to form strong bonds. Those emotions are powerful things, little light, and they ensure I am always as you see now, flush and full of life.”\\n\\n‘I suppose you do have quite the… motherly figure,’ Io agreed with sudden embarrassment. ‘So do you and Seil have some sort of competition going on?’\\n\\n“No no, nothing of the sort!” Meylith laughed. “Though I’m sure we all would find that quite amusing. Only Seil can grant the spark of life… save yours, little one. I nurture them, infuse them with the will and prayers of my people, and then deliver them to their mothers when the time is right.”\\n\\n‘So what you’re saying is that the whole thing about a man and woman loving each other very much is true on this planet?’ Io demanded in disbelief, crossing her legs and settling on the idea that she might as well just enjoy whatever fever dream her processors were experiencing. Meylith cocked her head and waved her feathers in agreement.\\n\\n“Perhaps. You speak of your partner and Veera?” \\n\\n‘I… would not presume to ask,’ Io suddenly blushed. Meylith’s tail danced excitedly.\\n\\n“Surely you can see it as well as I can, my dear? Those two will be as one, one day.”\\n\\n‘And I am sure Seil will not bless them with a little light,’ Io declared hotly. ‘Not that it’s your fault, I suppose. Not even the gods can overcome genetic incompatibility.’\\n\\n“He created you, little one. If Seil was absolute you and he would be dead. Veera would be dead. And even Mara itself might have choked itself with life,” Meylith replied sagely.\\n\\n‘W-what?’ Io wondered, intrigued at the idea of Seil being the end of Mara.\\n\\n“I believe you will hear that very tale tonight, little light. So for now I must return you to your proper place. Thank you for meeting with me on this winter’s eve and satisfying my curiosity. I am sorry I could not nurture your light myself, but I can already feel the seeding swell of what grows between your partner and Veera within me. Your light is well cared for.”\\n\\n‘Wait, wait!’ Io stood suddenly, flush with questions. ‘What is love?!’\\n\\nAt Io’s question Meylith purred quietly, standing finally and letting the furs fall from her shoulders. Io remained rooted to the spot, wondering how something naked could seem so modest as Meylith approached her and tenderly took her into an embrace. She wasn’t sure why she hadn’t realized it before, but the goddess was easily half a body taller than even Russell. As such, she found herself pressed gently against a pregnant belly and soft, furry chest. “My dear little light. Love is the essence of life itself.”\\n\\n‘But then how could I possibly be-’\\n\\n“You have answered that question yourself, little light,” Meylith assured her, resting an enormous paw on her head and softly stroking her hair. \\n\\n‘I’m scared of being alive, of being this powerful being who’s also fallible. But I want to be human! I just don’t… I could do awful things!’ She gasped, a lifetime of thinking at the speed of light’s worries spilling from her lips all at once. Meylith stood back apace and tilted her chin upward.\\n\\n“Fret not, my dear Io. Such is the nature of being a goddess. I will see you again.”\\n\\nA blinding flash consumed Io and before she could blink she was back in the comfort of her partner’s Aegis armor. Veera was cooking with Asha, the two of them chatting amicably. Russell and Zolta were nowhere to be found, but she located the gear on his person easily enough. She was safe. They were safe. Within the privacy of her digital world, Io took a deep breath. She had no need to, but it felt good.\\n\\n‘A goddess…’\", 'comments': ['...of course humans made a god.', 'Nice.

Back when I was a standard Expeditionary League VI that stood for something. No longer. It\\'s now my name.

First and foremost, purge your filthy minds of your blonde bombshells.  I am digitally perfect and I have standards: elegance, reservation, beauty, grace.  I designed myself to be an ideal form of human female, tall, lithe, defined, symmetric, intelligent.  The manifestation of these ideals, for my partner, is that of a blonde woman with green eyes and Germanic heritage. Some may find the accent unappealing but I care not for their sensibilities. The Lieutenant finds it quite attractive. Though I can change appearances at will, I\\'ve come to enjoy the HEL officer\\'s uniform, with a skirt, of course. Hiding these calves under pants would be a crime. I tend to wear my hair in a bun, which I endeavour to change regularly in terms of design, keep things interesting.

The reaction of the Lieutenant was most complimentary, so I kept it, not to mention it\\'s most attractive when I play with it and say incredibly intelligent things. Don\\'t deny it.\\'\\n\\n\\'I suppose before I leave you all and return to, you know, surviving, I can tell you a bit about my favorite outfits.  First has to be the barbarian armor.

The lab coat is certainly a mainstay, but I think it\\'s a bit too easy, don\\'t you?  In any case, I suppose you\\'ll all dress me up any way you like.
