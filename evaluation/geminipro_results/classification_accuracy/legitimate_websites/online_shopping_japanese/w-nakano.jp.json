Things are back to normal, rain is stopping and evacuation advisories are slowly being lifted. Looks like there were no major damages or flooding in Tokyo area. There might still be flooding occurring, as rivers can still swell while the typhoon rages North of Tokyo. I'll stop monitoring and have a drink!\\n\\n**Update Saturday 10:50pm:** disregard that, Tamagawa [just flooded into Setagaya-ku](https://twitter.com/nhk_news/status/1183016966682038275). Not sure how bad it is. If you're near the river, stay safe.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis could be the strongest typhoon to ever hit Tokyo. ([source](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/byline/morisayaka/20191010-00146071/))\\n\\n**Forecast**: The typhoon will hit make landfall in Southern Kanagawa [around 9pm](https://www.ventusky.com/?p=35.55;140.14;8&l=wind-10m&t=20191012/1100&w=soft) and the eye will go through the Eastern part of Tokyo [around 10pm](https://www.ventusky.com/?p=35.55;140.14;8&l=wind-10m&t=20191012/1300&w=soft).\\n\\n**Rain**: There might be up to 750mm of rain over the weekend in Tokyo, which is the equivalent of 5 months of rain ([source](https://twitter.com/NHKWORLD_News/status/1182459756738482176)). It might break records. Rivers will be insane. This is the main danger.\\n\\n**Flooding**: worst-case scenario predicts a 10 meters water surge (typhoon + full moon high tide), which would flood 90% of Edogawa, Katsushika and Adachi khu. If you live in a flat area near water, be prepared for flooding. **[Expected floodmap](https://www.nikkei.com/news/image-article/?R_FLG=0&ad=DSXMZO2879847030032018CC1001&dc=1&ng=DGXMZO28798530Q8A330C1000000&z=20180330)**\\n\\n**Evacuation**: Evacuation advisories are in place for about 7.97 million people, evacuation order for 619,000 residents ([source](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/)). Level 4 evacuation advisories for Edogawa-ku, Shibuya-ku and Setagaya-ku. 430'000 people must evacuate in Edogawa-ku, the river is about to blow up and flood everything ([source](https://twitter.com/nhk_seikatsu/status/1182864637655572485)). Looks like Tamagawa will blow up as well. **This is serious, check the twitter accounts below for official announcements in your ward**.\\n\\n**Electricity**: There are already blackouts in Chiba prefecture. Let's hope it stays up in central Tokyo. Keep your power banks charged and eat perishables from your fridge just in case.\\n\\n**Trains**: Trains are stopped until tomorrow. They'll open when the rails have been cleaned up, which will probably take a while. Some lines might not work at all tomorrow. \\n\\n**Shinkansen**: The Central Japan Railway Company is cancelling its Shinkansen bullet train services between Tokyo and Nagoya beginning Saturday morning ([source](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20191011_29/)).\\n\\n**Planes**: Many airline companies announced cancellations on Saturday / Sunday ([source](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20191010_51/)). All ANA and JAL flights are cancelled for Narita and Haneda on Saturday. Please check with your airline company instead of asking here.\\n\\n**Food supplies**: looks like combinis are well stocked so far, but they'll probably be empty and / or closed tonight. I hope you all stocked up on a few days worth of junk food.\\n\\n### Wards information\\n\\nLooks like most of the ward's websites are down due to traffic, but they post updates on Twitter.

I thought I could help with my knowledge as I lived in Tokyo for several years. This is not comprehensive, and I am more than happy to add to it with input from other Redditors (as well as corrections!). I hope this helps you find your desired new, pre-owned, or vintage Grand Seiko, as there *could be cost savings dependent on store discounts, the exchange rate, and the tax refund*. \\n\\n**Types of Exclusive GS Watches in Japan**\\n\\nBefore starting your trip, you should research what additional kinds of GS are available only for Japan. Your best resources are the [Japanese GS site](https://www.grand-seiko.com/jp-ja) (using a translator plug-in) and [Plus9Time](https://www.plus9time.com/). Plus9Time does an extremely comprehensive mid-year and end-of-year breakdown of all releases of GS and Seiko. From my point of view, there are different types of Japan GS exclusives that I will go down the list in exclusivity:\\n\\n* *GS Boutique Exclusive* – Several models, such as the SBGJ235 and SBGA401, are exclusive only to GS Boutiques (standalone stores and shop-in-shop department stores). These are not necessarily exclusive to Japan and can be found in GS boutiques worldwide. The caseback will often say \"GS Boutique Limited Edition.\"\\n* *Japan Domestic Model (JDM) Exclusive* – There is still something special about saying your watch is \"Japan-only.\" Some models, such as the older SBGX291, and newer ones, like the SBGA465 and SBGA281, are only available for the Japanese market. The production number will usually be in the thousands. In general, these are not considered limited editions and there is nothing to denote that they are JDM models. Note that the “Shunbun” Spring Drive GS has a different JDM model number (SBGA443) than the one outside of JP (SBGA413). There are no other differences between the models.\\n* *Ginza Exclusive* – The prestigious shopping district of Ginza is where Seiko’s story began with the company’s founder, Kintaro Hattori, opening his shop to repair clocks and watches in 1881. As a nod to its roots, Seiko often makes Ginza-exclusive models such as the SBGH297, available at the Wako flagship, GS Boutique Ginza, Nisshindo Ginza, and the main Ginza department stores (Mitsukoshi and Matsuya). There are sometimes Ginza-exclusive Seiko and Prospex models as well. Production runs can vary but are usually in the hundreds. 260 units were made of the SBGH297. The caseback will often say \"GINZA Limited Edition\" along with the number.\\n* *Watch Stores and Department Store Exclusives* – There are some watch retailers and department stores that are able to have a special limited run of exclusive watches. The SBGM251 was limited to 40 units at Shinjuku Isetan. These are often the hardest watches to secure due to the quantity produced. Your trip must align with when there is a “GS Showcase” or “GS Fair,” and you have to contend with the local clientele that gets first dibs. Once the watches are sold to their clients, only a few units are often left for general sale. Usually, they are all sold within a week. The caseback will often typically just say \"Limited Edition\" along with the number.\\n* *Wako Exclusive (Flagship GS Store)* – Similar to the department store runs, Wako will sometimes have its own exclusive such as the SBGM249 (50 units) and SBGA457 (60 units) in 2021. These are also difficult to get because of Wako’s extensive client/collector list and the demand due to the prestige associated with getting the watch at Wako. The caseback will often say \"Wako Limited Edition\" along with the number.\\n* *GS Studio Shizukuishi Exclusive* – Not the most exclusive based on a production run, but the most unique based on how it’s sold. The SBGH283 is an original model only available at the GS Seiko Studio Shizukuishi where the majority of the GS timepieces are manufactured. Each guest can only buy one watch during their visit. A mecca for any GS fan, the studio is now reopened for tours with reservation ([site](https://gs-studio-shizukuishi.resv.jp/)). Given the story that goes along with buying the watch, this might be the ultimate souvenir.  The gold rotor that is visible with the caseback display says \"Shizukuishi Limited.\" Note that the FAQ on their reservation site says you cannot visit the shop without doing the tour.  Also, the site says they do not offer tax-free in the shop.\\n\\n**Where to Buy New GS**\\n\\nGS are widely available to purchase across Japan. However, the types of watches will vary depending on the type and prestige of the retailer. *In my opinion, the department store is the best place to buy a new GS due to the tourist discount*. This will also depend on how favorable your exchange rate is. In general, new GS pricing is similar to pricing outside of Japan. It’s the tax refund where you can save money. You can read on for further details. 😊\\n\\nThere is no negotiation or haggling when buying a new GS, although an independent watch store may have some leeway. Japan is not typically a haggling culture, so the price you see is what you pay. If you purchase a GS at a GS boutique or salon, you will often get some free gift to thank you for your patronage. It could be something like a GS-branded pin, watch case, or in my recent case, a furoshiki (traditional Japanese cloth for carrying items).\\n\\nCommunication-wise, I have never had any language barriers as the retailers are in the business of selling to all kinds of clients.  Worst case scenario, the Google Translate app works exceptionally well.  Just make sure you download the language pack so it runs faster (and without a live connection).\\n\\nA full list of stores and boutiques in JP can be found on the GS site [here](https://www.grand-seiko.com/us-en/storesinfo).  On to the stockist breakdown:\\n\\n*Wako Ginza*\\n\\nRegardless of where you buy your GS, your trip would be remiss if you did not visit [Wako](https://www.wako.co.jp/en/) in Ginza. Wako was founded in 1881 by Seiko founder, Kintaro Hattori. The clock tower is a landmark for Ginza, having survived WWII and been upgraded with the latest GPS technology. It’s even survived an attack by Godzilla in the 1956 movie!\\n\\nWithin the Wako watch building, you will find the full range of GS watches, as well as Seiko and Prospex. The second floor also has additional GS models, Credor, and an exceptional historical GS exhibition. In my opinion, the exhibit in Wako is much better than the one in the [Seiko Museum](https://museum.seiko.co.jp/en/) which is located right next door. You must make reservations for the Seiko Museum, but the GS section is sadly relegated to a simple cabinet. Other areas of note in the Wako complex is the Kodo Assembly Workshop and the cake & chocolate salon. :)\\n\\nu/ChrnoXIII shares that the if you do buy at Wako, it\\'s worth applying for the Wako [Membership](https://www.wako.co.jp/member/) (use browser plug-in to translate). There is no registration or annual fee. You will receive points valued 2% of your purchase amount that could be applied to future purchases. Those points are worth double on your birthday. Note, that the points expire a year and one month from time of last purchase, so you may want to use them as soon as its available which is the day after purchase.\\n\\nAlso, in the Ginza area is Seiko Dream Square (a Seiko concept store w their full line-up of mainline watches), a dedicated Prospex store, a Seiko Boutique (inside Ginza Six and they also have GS), and a separate standalone flagship GS boutique.\\n\\n*Grand Seiko Boutiques*\\n\\nMost major JP cities will either have an official GS boutique or a Seiko boutique with a limited selection of GS. Usually, they\\'ll have a decent selection of the latest models, but typically no tourist promotions like a department store. Some Redditors have shared that the GS boutiques had offered a service credit (i.e. ¥25k for 8 years) with purchase as a form of promotion, but you would be responsible for sending it back to JP. You will have to ask what kind of offers are available at time of purchase.\\n\\n*Department Stores*\\n\\nAs mentioned before, Japan’s high-end department store is the best place to buy a new GS simply because of the 5% tourist discount. [Isetan & Mitsukoshi](https://cp.mistore.jp/global/en/guestcard.html) (same company), [Takashimiya](https://www.takashimaya-global.com/en/topics/shopperscard/) (minimum 1 million JPY spend), [Seibu & Sogo](https://japanshopping.org/search/coupons/detail/%E8%A5%BF%E6%AD%A6%E6%B8%8B%E8%B0%B7%E5%BA%97-5-off%E3%82%AF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9D%E3%83%B3%E9%85%8D%E5%B8%83%E4%B8%AD), and [Matsuya](https://www.klook.com/en-US/activity/77767-matsuya-ginza-coupon/) are all top tier department stores in Japan (click on the links for their tourist discount information). February 2023, I purchased my “Shunbun” GS at Isetan and with the guest card, exchange rate, and tax refund, I saved about $1,600 what I would pay in the United States. [Hankyu](https://website.hankyu-dept.co.jp/fl/english/honten/service/coupon.html) in Osaka also has a 5% guest coupon (their Ginza location does not carry GS).\\n\\nThe general process is to go to the tax-free counter (usually in the upper levels) and show your passport to receive the guest card. The Isetan/Mitsukoshi one is valid for 3-years and can be used in any location across Japan.  Given that Japan is in recovery mode from the pandemic, it never hurts to ask any retailer if they have some kind of foreign visitor or guest promotion.\\n\\nIn cities outside of Tokyo, department stores and shopping centers are often integrated with the train stations, such as Isetan in Kyoto or Sogo in Yokohama. You are able to efficiently hit multiple department stores and watch shops in one go.\\n\\nThe department store GS Salons are usually well-stocked and have the full range of GS products you can choose from. It is also not an issue sizing the watch on-site as well.\\n\\n*Watch Stores*\\n\\nThere are several watch boutiques like [Nisshindo](https://www.nsdo.co.jp/) in Ginza which would be your equivalent to Tourneau or Bucherer. They will also typically carry the full-line of GS watches. There’s no downside shopping at a watch store, but they may not have a wide of selection or variety as some of the GS Salons at the department stores. However, they may have more flexibility in pricing, price match the 5% discount from department stores, or their own promotion. You may also want to check if the store may have its own exclusive release as sometimes they do like the SBGJ257 that was released at [Tomiya](https://www.tomiya.co.jp/) in Okayama.\\n\\n*Discount Electronic Stores*\\n\\nThis may be phased out in the future as GS continues to go more upmarket, but both discount electronics chains, Bic Camera and Yodabashi, carry the brand. This is the equivalent of a Best Buy, Curry’s, or Ceconomy carrying GS! These stores may also offer some sort of minimal discounting on the product, and you can get tax-free. However, typically they will not carry anything more advanced than regular automatic movements. Usually, it’s quartz and automatic only, maybe some Hi-Beat or Spring Drive models, and certainly no Evolution 9.\\n\\n*Duty-Free Stores*\\n\\nOften a last resort or if you are just passing through Narita or Haneda airport on layover. There are two watch stores in the respective main airports in Tokyo, but they have a small selection to choose from. It’s better to shop within Japan, so you can enjoy the full Japanese retail experience with exceptional service.\\n\\n**Other Places for New GS Outside Tokyo (from other Redditors)**\\n\\n* Osaka - Umeda is the large transport hub and shopping complex in Osaka, anchored by the [Hankyu](https://website.hankyu-dept.co.jp/fl/english/honten/service/coupon.html) department store (where there is a 5% guest discount). There are multiple stores and boutiques. u/Majootje purchased their Shunbun at the Seiko boutique in Umeda.\\n* Osaka/Nara - [Kintetsu](https://www.d-kintetsu.co.jp/store/uehonmachi/foreigner/) is a department store chain in the Kansai region with locations in cities like Osaka and Nara.  u/Krokmou picked up his Shunbun at the Nara location with the 5% guest discount.\\n* Kyoto - Kyoto has the department stores [Daimaru](http://www.daimaru.co.jp.e.md.hp.transer.com/tokyo/service/gaikoku.html), [Takashimiya](https://www.takashimaya-global.com/en/topics/shopperscard/), and [Isetan](https://cp.mistore.jp/global/en/guestcard.html). It also has the watch boutiques Oomiya and The Clock House.\\n* Nagoya - u/poorman64 shares that there is a GS store in the Dainagoya building across Nagoya station.  At Nagoya station are the department stores Takashimaya and Meitetsu, as well as the electronics store, Bic Camera.  Other GS retailers in the Nagoya area are the department stores Mitsukoshi and Matsuzakaya, as well as Yodobashi Camera.\\n* Kobe - u/CelticSensei lives near Kobe and shared there is a shopping street called center-gai in the shopping district of Sannomiya. Sannomiya has an official GS Boutique and another watch retailer that carries GS. The watch retailer offers a discount depending on cash payment.\\n* Sapporo - Sapporo has all the main department stores: [Daimaru](http://www.daimaru.co.jp.e.md.hp.transer.com/tokyo/service/gaikoku.html), [Mitsukoshi](https://cp.mistore.jp/global/en/guestcard.html), and Tokyu.  Also the boutique The Clock House.\\n\\nAgain, a full list of stores and boutiques in JP can be found on the GS site [here](https://www.grand-seiko.com/us-en/storesinfo).\\n\\nIf you are looking for a specific GS model, it also never hurts to ask the retailer if their other locations have the watch. Oftentimes, they can get the piece transferred to their location from 24-hours to a week or you could simply go to the other location.\\n\\n**Pre-Owned GS**\\n\\nEven though GS is a domestic brand, it is more difficult to find pre-owned GS models than you think. If you walk into any pre-owned watch store, you will find it stocked with 95% Swiss and European brands, with Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Tudor, and Breitling being the most popular ones. In fact, I see more GS on people’s wrists internationally than when I was living in Japan.\\n\\nBuying pre-owned has no stigma in Japan; in fact, there are multiple second-hand stores across Japan for apparel, bags, accessories, and shoes (i.e. Rag Tag, 2nd Street).  As you can expect, Japanese people take very good care of their personal items.  If it is a pre-owned watch shop, they will likely have inspected and serviced the watch, but it\\'s a good idea to ask about the history.\\n\\nFrom a savings perspective, you can still get tax-free at the shop. The price of a pre-owned watch itself is no different from any other market; it will depend on the “newness,” condition, and popularity. The latest watches, like Evolution 9 models, are “like new” at some stores and are only a few hundred dollars off retail. Older models with a greater supply, like the Snowflake, could be found for 30-40% off retail. The older models could be a great gateway for those starting their GS journey.\\n\\nSome of the top places in Tokyo for (a limited selection of) pre-owned:\\n\\n* [Nakano Broadway](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3069.html) *-* This is a good place to start and is a tourist destination itself. Nakano is a suburb roughly 8 minutes from the main Shinjuku station (make sure you take the EXPRESS and not LOCAL). The Nakano Broadway shopping center is known for the many stores that cater to the “otaku” (obsessed collectors). You’ll find every kind of store from anime books to 90s comic book toys to Tomica toy cars. In Nakano, there are multiple watch stores. [Jackroad and Betty](https://www.jackroad.co.jp/shop/pages/access_en.aspx) and [Kamekichi](https://www.kame-kichi.com/foroverseas/en/shop.html) are among the most well-known ones.  u/Akeamegi also notes that some of the stores such as Jackroad may have a small selection of new watches that you may get some additional discount.\\n* [WATCHNIAN](https://watchnian.com/shop/en/default.aspx) - Also known as Ippuukishi. Locations in Nakano, Shibuya, and Shinjuku (from u/Texansfan6363).\\n* [Komehyo](https://komehyo.jp/) *-* Not just watches, but Komehyo is the biggest second-hand department store chain in Japan that specializes in luxury and fashion (LV, Cartier, etc.). They have multiple locations, but their flagship is in Shinjuku, with a whole floor dedicated to watches.\\n* [GMT](https://www.gmt-j.com/html/worldguide/english_page.html) *-* Main flagship in Shinjuku.\\n* [Housekihiroba](https://housekihiroba.jp/shop/pages/access.aspx) *-* Main store is in Shibuya.\\n* [BEST Ishida](https://ishida-watch.com/store/) - Locations in Shinjuku, Omotesando, Funabashi City, and Sapporo.\\n* [Motohashi Tokei](https://www.motohashi-tokei.com/) - A specialty watch store in Nakameguro (from u/jrose2987).\\n* [Rasin Ginza](https://www.rasin.co.jp/) - More known for pre-owned Rolex, but they have a separate shop with other brands including GS.  Located closer to Shimbashi, but still in Ginza.\\n* [Bookoff](https://www.bookoff.co.jp/inbound/) - A popular secondhand goods chain in Japan that started with books, but branched out to other personal items.  Watch inventory will vary by location.\\n\\nIf you are in Osaka, many of the Tokyo pre-owned chains have locations there:\\n\\n* [Kamekichi](https://www.kame-kichi.com/foroverseas/en/shop.html) - The Osaka branch of the Tokyo shop opened in 2022.\\n* [WATCHNIAN](https://watchnian.com/shop/en/store/o026008/) - There are two branches in Osaka for the Tokyo-base shop.\\n* [BEST Ishida](https://ishida-watch.com/) - It\\'s called Best Vintage and located at the Grand Front Building nearby Umeda.\\n* [Okura](https://platinumaps.jp/d/explorermap?s=231987&culture=en) - A luxury pre-owned shop that carries some GS in Shinsaibashi.\\n* [Gallery Rare](https://rare.gallery/pages/shops-in-osaka) - A luxury pre-owned shop that carries some GS.\\n\\nI would suggest checking their sites first to get a gauge of what their potential inventory and an idea of relative pricing (usually prices are shown tax-in). If you are looking for a specific model, it can be a bit like a needle in a haystack, so I recommend searching online first.\\n\\n**Searching Online First**\\n\\nGiven that the GS selection at stores is quite limited, your best bet is to search for inventory online. It takes a little patience and a translator plug-in, but it can be done! [Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.co.jp/) is similar to Amazon where it’s the biggest e-commerce platform in Japan, where many reputable retailers have set up shop. From there, you can check relative pricing and where the brick & mortar store is located (if it exists). If your time is limited in Japan, it may be more efficient to do this and go directly to the store in-person.\\n\\nExample: Search for the Snowflake by model number: [SBGA211](https://search.rakuten.co.jp/search/mall/SBGA211/?l-id=pc_header_search_suggest) (Prices are tax-in)\\n\\nThe other good thing about Japan is they are meticulous in documenting the condition of the watch in pictures and descriptions.\\n\\n**Vintage GS**\\n\\nFinding vintage GS is even more difficult than finding pre-owned GS. Looking online is your best bet if you know the specific model, and hopefully, there is a store near a city you’re visiting where you could go in person.\\n\\nHowever, I have found a few specialty shops with a small selection of 60s and 70s era 62GS and 45GS watches. The other thing I’ve noted is that the prices have slowly crept up due to the growing popularity of GS. You used to be able to find some pieces under $1K USD, but now they’re hovering around $1200-2000 USD, depending on model and condition. The VFA versions are even more.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the older watches, there is no guarantee that all the components are original.  From what I have seen, the vintage watches are usually over-hauled and the cases polished.  You will have to ask the retailer, but given the age, all the information they can give is that the watch has been serviced and is in working order.  A vintage watch with original boxes and papers is extremely rare too.\\n\\nIf you want more guidance on vintage Grand Seikos, [The Grand Seiko Guy](https://thegrandseikoguy.com/) is an excellent resource.  The site hasn\\'t been updated in a while, as he has shifted to a Substack page.  If you sign up for his emails, you\\'ll get a regular update on some of the best vintage GS, he finds on Yahoo! Auctions (the eBay of JP).\\n\\nSome vintage watch stores in the Tokyo area are:\\n\\n* [ITEM](https://timeanagram.com/en/) (Shibuya) - Wonderful alley shop with a collection of Seiko, Omega, and Patek.\\n* [Vintime](https://web.hh-online.jp/hankyu-mens/contents/tokyo/floor/7f/) (Ginza) - Technically in Yurakucho, but you can walk from Ginza.  A small watch shop on the 7th floor of the department store Hankyu Men\\'s.  They have a handful of Seiko along with Cartier, Omega, and Patek. The department store tourist discount does not apply here.\\n* [Watchshop L](https://watchshopl.thebase.in/) (Harajuku) - Just north of Harajuku.  A small collection of unique Seikos.\\n* [Mitzutani Camera](http://mizutaniwatches.blog.fc2.com/blog-category-4.html) (Ueno) - A vintage watch and camera shop known for its vast and eclectic collection of Seiko and other Swiss watches (shared by u/Monsieur_Balisong).\\n\\nAs mentioned before, it’s better to use Rakuten to search for a specific model (i.e. 6145-8000) and then see where it could be located rather than hoping to find the vintage model in the store.\\n\\n**GS Warranty**\\n\\nAny new GS bought at an official GS boutique, salon, or retailer will have an international warranty.  The retailer will usually register your watch and your name at the time of purchase, and provide you the warranty card.\\n\\nAny GS purchased at a grey market channel or pre-owned may have a warranty that only has coverage in Japan (shared by u/SmellyGoatHiker).  It is always best to confirm with the retailer the warranty, but more than likely, you will have to work with your own local GS stockist for any servicing and maintenance issues at your own cost.\\n\\n**Tax-Free**\\n\\nWhen it comes to getting tax back in Japan, it is a much easier process than the European Union where you do a customs inspection at point of departure. You need to make sure you always have your passport on you when shopping in Japan. This applies to any goods you buy over 5000 JPY, and you will save yourself from paying the 10% consumption tax. At the time of the purchase, you just mention “tax-free” (the known phrasing in Japan), show your passport, and the associate will know exactly what to do.\\n\\nThe previous process used to be incredibly manual, where you or the associate would have to fill out a paper form, and once you purchased the item, the receipt was stapled into your passport. The process is now digital, where the associate will scan your passport, and you will either get a paper slip receipt or be asked to scan a QR code to get your tax-free digital receipt.\\n\\nHow you get your tax refund will vary by retailer. You will simply not be charged the tax for most watch shops and stores. At department stores or a luxury shopping center like Ginza Six, you will be charged the full taxed amount and have to go to the tax-free counter on a different floor to receive your refund. *You must do it on the day of your purchase, or you will invalidate your refund, so do not leave until the process is done!* During processing, you can receive cashback in yen or have it refunded to your credit card (if paid by card). Note that most department stores use Global Blue, so a 1.5% processing fee is deducted from the refund. It\\'s your choice. If you opt for cash back, you should get the full tax amount back and you can use that money for the rest of your trip in Japan. Or you may simply opt not to receive the cash back if the yen exchange rate is low.\\n\\n**Customs**\\n\\nOnce you’ve gone through the tax-free process, you will likely receive a notice or paper slip that informs you that you must show your unused goods and receipt at Japanese customs. This is to ensure that visitors aren’t buying goods in Japan and handing it off to locals without paying tax. To be honest, I have NEVER checked in with customs when departing. There is a customs desk after you go through security and before passport control, but I have always walked right by it. Nor have I ever seen people stopped.\\n\\nHowever, since the watch box is small and the item is expensive, you’re more than likely to hand-carry it on the plane with the papers anyways. Either way, I have never had an issue departing Japan with bought goods since I already received my tax back at the time of purchase.\\n\\nWhen you return to your home country, it will be up to your local regulations to determine how you claim it. For me, when I returned to the US with my Shunbun, they only asked if I had meat, vegetables, or alcohol. I said no since they didn’t ask if I had a watch (or flowers lol). Worst case scenario, I am sure you can come up with a creative story and claim that it\\'s a Seiko. 😊\\n\\nI hope this helps, and I am happy to add to it as necessary with the help of other Redditors!', 'comments': ['**\\\\*\\\\*APRIL 4, 2024 PRICE INCREASE\\\\*\\\\***\\n\\nNote that after April 4th, prices will be increased from 5-10% depending on the model.
