The closest thing for me was that I was refused an apartment once because I\\'m a foreigner. Had they met me in person I\\'d like to think they might change their mind.\\n |Anyway preferential treatment sure. Speaking honestly I\\'m treated kind of like a celebrity in many ways. It\\'s easy to meet women, people want to be your friend, but it\\'s not always necessarily that kind of sincere. Just like of like, oh, I want to say I have a white friend/ boyfriend.\\n |Then there\\'s the negative side in the sense that people will never really accept you no matter how well you speak Japanese, and they will constantly reinforce you are different even if its offered like a compliment (like, \"oh you can use chopsticks so well! Your Japanese is so good!\"\\n |Here\\'s a pretty good example of what I\\'m talking about :P  [Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLt5qSm9U80)\\n[Hey at least they allow interracial marriages. I don\\'t think Korea does.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuqfa2?context=5)|Hah, well I think a lot of Japanese moms and dads are pretty excited here when their kid brings home a foreigner. Depends on the family of course but from what I understand of Korea, you might be right :)\\n[White and foreigner are not interchangeable.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chv151o?context=5)|Good point, people (including myself) often make this mistake. And I think that maybe a Chinese boyfriend, a white American boyfriend, and a Ghana boyfriend will all be received differently. \\n[Have you noticed a huge amount of bullying going on at schools in Japan? I mean more than at schools in America? Is there much being done to try and curb it? Or to help victims of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chutxf7?context=5)|I\\'ve never worked at an American school so I couldn\\'t really say. On the first time of each new year the teachers go over bullying policy a little but but I wouldn\\'t say it curbs it. I work in a private high school, so my experience is probably different than many of the less funded public highschools you\\'d find around. I had a friend working in a tokyo public school where one of the students put detergent beads into the school soup, and students have beaten other students bloody... so everybody\\'s experience is different. I don\\'t know exactly how much is being done about it in general, but in my current school there isn\\'t a whole lot of bullying. \\n[What is something you\\'ve experienced/seen in Japan that is far better in America?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuqqtc?context=5)|Japan positive points: Transportation system, etiquette, toilet technology, overall product quality and NOOO TIPPING!!! (which sucked for me as a bartender, but as a consumer is the greatest thing ever.\\n |Bad things not found in America but found in Japan: 2011 earthquake (which broke my dishes in Tokyo) and the subsequent nuclear disaster, Men willing to pay 40,000 yen (about 400 dollars) to buy used women\\'s panties, Godzilla (although I guess hes in America now), ridiculously expensive parking, HORRIBLE AND TEDIOUS BUREAUCRACY. Also good luck getting a drivers licence from scratch here, you have to attend a mandatory 2 week or so driving \"camp\" as well as fill out the forms and paperwork. It\\'ll only cost you a few THOUSAND dollars.\\n |I would argue that America also has better clubs,bars and night life, restaurant variety, social diversity. Also pizza. Japan pizza can not compare with American pizza (with veeery few exceptions). \\n[Can you go into detail about the tedious bureaucracy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chvxrof?context=5)|Put it this way. If you\\'re American and you want to change your drivers license into a Japanese one, first you have to go to one office to get it translated, that takes like a week, then you have to submit an application to a driving school, which required you to set up an appointment by phone within a one or two hour window on a weekday, then the appointment can usually only be made for a weekday during the afternoon, so good luck finding time to do that during a weekday. Then you need to take a written test, then a driving test where they fail about 60% of first attempts, then you get the license.\\n |Another good example: finding an apartment required you to go to all corners of the earth. You need a guarantor, and special documentation from him/her/ guarantor company, then you need documentation from the city regarding your current residence, your passport, some immigration information and everything has to be perfect.  Sometimes you can\\'t even sign with your name, you have to buy a hanko seal, then you have to make appointments to submit everything and it\\'s all a big hassle. Don\\'t even get me started on the immigration office. It\\'s like the old DMV.\\n[I\\'ve heard things like that before. Is it also true that if you try and do anything out of the ordinary, you just get a blank look and they tell you \"it is not possible\", which is basically a polite way of telling you to go and fuck yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chx2hcd?context=5)|Basically, yeah. They apologize profusely like its their fault but really they\\'re probably thinking \"well, you should have known better\"\\n[Which other foreigner you met while living in japan? And how they like it there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuqjmg?context=5)|I\\'ve met foreigners from seemingly every corner of the globe in the time I\\'ve been here, Iran, Croatia, Turkey, Ukraine, Brazil, Peru, Vietnam, New Zealand. One thing that is great about living in such a homogeneous country such as Japan, is that the .05% who aren\\'t Japanese all feel a little bit more brotherhood/sisterhood :). I would say that most other foreigners feel similarly about living here as I do, although their experience might be a little different from mine. I\\'m treated a little differently here than say, my 180cm tall tank-like black friend from Jamaica, who is treated differently from my good friend from Vietnam. Same as the rest of the world I suppose. \\n[How tall are you then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuuecz?context=5)|About 176cm. I guess my friend is about 190 then, thinking about it now \\n[Do you identify with Charisma Man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chux7yh?context=5)|Haha yeah I saw this a pretty long time ago and thought it was semi-accurate. Although I  have white friends here who were nerds before and still are now and they\\'re not gettin any. I feel like nerds are even more socially acceptable in the US now then they are here.\\n |I had pretty steady relationships back in the US, but it\\'s definitely a different story here. \\n[My little brother is really into anime and wants to learn Japanese. What is the best way to do this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuq4zt?context=5)|Well if hes too young to enroll in a class/summer program or something, there\\'s plenty of resources online.\\n |I had this book when I started out.\\n |[Link to www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Manga-Way-Illustrated-Structure/dp/1880656906/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1401439081&sr=8-1&keywords=learn+japanese+through+manga)\\n |It teaches you Japanese in the style of manga, so maybe that\\'ll motivate him more if he isn\\'t already motivated. Other than that there are great free resources like JapanesePod101 podcasts, great flashcard memorization websites like memrise.com and others. I started out with a 3 month summer course at a university, and that was very helpful for me. It can be hard starting out because the alphabet is so foreign, but textbooks like the one I gave you should be helpful.\\n |Also, a company I used to work at here www.lang-8.com is a great resource. Basically a peer-peer editing social website. you post an entry in Japanese, and a Japanese native corrects it for you and vice versa.\\n |Skype lessons are also another great option. You can find those with a quick google search. \\n[Uuu these all look like good options, thanks!  I want to be supportive but am just so out of my element when it comes to stuff that isn\\'t in English or Spanish lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuqgby?context=5)|Well, I studied Spanish for 7 years and didn\\'t learn anything. I studied Japanese for 1.5 and I can speak it comfortably, so if your brother is as motivated as I was, he might not need a lot of support :)\\n[Have you gotten some tang yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuqtb9?context=5)|Death by snu-snu.\\n[*tang.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuye43?context=5)|I will admit that I was very much in the same boat as you regarding your aspirations. I am a white heterosexual american male (as you can see from my proof) Coming from a guy who used to only have 3 year, 4 year, 2 year relationships back in the States, I would say that since I\\'ve reached conversational fluency in Japanese, there has been an overflow of tang to the point that I don\\'t even want a relationship anymore. All of my American friends hate me right now.\\n[Hahaha!!! Oh man. Well I am incredibly jealous as well! Wow. How long did it take you to reach conversational fluency?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chwwb99?context=5)|Conversationally fluency took me about a year/year and a half of intensive language study IN Japan.\\n[Feel free to get started on Tokyo. I\\'ll be happy to listen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chwwb99?context=5)|Tokyo...I\\'ll just say google \"Tokyo Girls\" and look at the pictures. I\\'d say that the pictures that you see there of just normal girls on the street is pretty representative of Tokyo, or nearly every major city in Japan.\\n[Edit: I just looked at your proof pictures. Okay, seriously, I\\'m going to quit my job tomorrow morning and buy a plane ticket to Tokyo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chwwb99?context=5)|I\\'ll also add that Kyoto has more Universities than any other city in Japan. University students account for almost 1/10 of the Kyoto population... so do the math ^^\\n[How good do average japanese people speak english? My stereotype is that they are either very bad or very shy about using it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuq8am?context=5)|English is now taught from the elementary level in Japan. That means that most people can speak very basic phrases, like ask you your name, or where are you from. (In fact those will probably be the first 2 questions youll get from anybody here when they meet you). Other than that, you won\\'t be able to find many people that will readily carry out a conversation with you, either because they can\\'t (because the English education here kind of sucks), or because like you said, they are shy about making a mistake and therefore will say little or avoid speaking it all together. It can be quite frustrating as it was for me when I lived in Tokyo and spoke no Japanese.\\n[I was just in Kyoto for vacation and these group of middle schoolers from a town outside Fuji were on a field trip \"interviewed\"  me for a school project. It was adorable.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chv0mos?context=5)|Yeah our school gives our students assignments like the interview you had. It\\'s definitely a good experience for them.\\n[Off topic I was also stopped by an NHK film crew in Tokyo. Man I wish I could track that footage down, ha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chv0mos?context=5)|I was also interviewed by Osaka TV. I managed to get the DVD of it but Japanese programming had a special encoding that makes watching those DVDs on foreign OSs a bitch... I would love to get on a gameshow though!\\n[Japan was fun, can\\'t wait to go back some time. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chv0mos?context=5)|Glad you had a fun time in Kyoto!\\n[How about talking english to other non-native-speakers? Does that losen the tongue, because both don\\'t use perfect english?  That has at least been my experience, beeing a non-native-speaker, with people from other countries which don\\'t have english as their first language.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuqdub?context=5)|Yeah well actually about 75 percent of the foreigners I know here are not native english speakers, but they can all speak far better English than the average Japanese person. So, you could say it doesn\\'t take much to loosen their tongues. Conversation comes pretty naturally. \\n[Moving to japan and teaching there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chxabkz?context=5)|The only regret that I have is a personal one, that I ended up sacrificing a very great relationship to come here, but looking back on the last 4 years, had I not come here, I would have been a very very different person and there would have been SOOO many amazing life experiences that I would have never had, so many countries I would have never been to, so many great friends and women I would have never met, and so many new perspectives. My move here has come to define me, so in that sense to answer your question, yes I would do it all again.\\n[Are there any different every day nuances that remind you \"wow im really far away form home\" or something like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chxabkz?context=5)|As an American growing up in a relatively sheltered environment (New York suburbs), I think there is no better way to understand the wider world than to try living in it. There are plenty of experiences that remind me I\\'m far from home. I feel that way everytime I step into a supermarket. The kendo club and kyudo club that I\\'m in is almost exclusively Japanese, maybe 1-2 foreigners, and they\\'re not even Western. My workplace only has one other foreign teacher and the rest are Japanese. I speak more Japanese during the day than English. A majority of the women I\\'ve had relations with here don\\'t speak English. The culture of relationships is so so so different here. So suffice it to say there isn\\'t a single day where I\\'m not reminded that I\\'m far away from home, but you get used to it, and there isn\\'t a single day where I don\\'t see something novel and fascinating.\\n |If you hate the country that you\\'re in, I\\'d imagine it would be a terrible experience for you, but I\\'m only working in Japan as a means to sustain my lifestyle here. I have a BA in Psychology, and my family are all doctors and scientists. I never imagined that I would ever be teaching English, and honestly if there was another job I could do here easily I\\'d probably be doing that. Teaching does give a sense of fulfillment, but teaching something like English is not my idea of a means of personal growth or academic fulfillment. In that sense, I value living in Japan way more than my job. The sad truth is, working for a Japanese company blows (the worth ethic that is). In that sense, I never see myself being here in the long term, but for the time that I am, I imagine it\\'ll be among the best years of my life. \\n[Why Kyoto? Why not Tokyo or Osaka?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuw4zd?context=5)|I used to live in Tokyo. It was very busy, crowded and noisy. It also had great night life, but honestly it wore on me after a while. Coming to Kyoto was a great choice in my opinion. Beautiful city, many parks, surrounded by nature, and its only a 30 minute train ride to Osaka for shopping and great night life. Living in Tokyo it took me more than 30 minutes just to get from downtown to my house in the suburbs. I think many people underestimate just how huge Tokyo is.\\n[What made you want to work and live in Japan in the first place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuq1ai?context=5)|I could go on all day about this but the basic reply is: I\\'m from New York, and graduated with a BA in Psychology. I\\'ve always been fascinated with Japanese culture, and was a little jaded with American culture. Japan seemed like a great place to challenge myself (within reason. I wasn\\'t about to move to Baghdad or something. Plus I had always wanted to study abroad but never had the chance. When I moved to Japan in 2010, I thought I would only stay for one year, but I\\'ve been here ever since. No regrets^^\\n[I had a chance to do exactly what you did.  Regrets.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuq4by?context=5)|It\\'s never too late really. I know a man in his 70\\'s who came here to study Japanese because he wanted an adventure, and I know a man who worked for decades in the Canadian government before he came to Kyoto Uni to work on a PhD. There\\'s always time ^^\\n[Is it true that there\\'s only one way to say \"cool\" \"awesome\" \"good job\" etc.? If so, how do you vary your praises to your students?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chvi1wi?context=5)|I guess maybe the way you express your praise is kind of praise in and of itself. If its offered with sincerity maybe there\\'s not much need for variation. But I mean sometimes we use stickers or stamps or bonus points, hi-fives... I guess it\\'s kind of individualistic. \\n[Did you like the movie \"The grudge\"? or \"Ju-on\"?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chux3uk?context=5)|Never saw the grudge, but saw Ju-on and Ringu. I prefer the American ring version, and Ju-on was meh :P.\\n[Since you look different from the locals (obviously\\\\), has there ever been a moment when someone has said something about you in Japanese in your presence,thinking that you won\\'t understand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chusiqx?context=5)|Students try to get away with that kind of often, but I usually catch it, and give em that \"oh yeahhh???\" face. pretty good reactions. \\n[I will need to find a job when my contract here ends. Since my current job is really an exchange program between my home university and the university here in Japan, what is the 就職活動 like for English teachers who are already in Japan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuqhvf?context=5)|Well I was teaching at a college part time before I found my current job so I was also kind of in the same situation you are now (needing to find a visa).\\n |Honestly I\\'ve found lots of jobs from prior co-workers and associates but the job I have now I actually just found listed on GaijinPot.com\\'s job listings. I\\'d say that\\'s a pretty good place to start, as most companies are more willing to extend the visa of somebody already in Japan rather than bring someone from overseas. \\n[I hope the GaijinPot job listings are better than the forums. I inquired on their forums a couple of years ago asking about precisely the same job I work now and everyone who replied was a bitter asshole who told me to never come to Japan...I guess I got the last laugh in the end, though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuqkqw?context=5)|I\\'ve had fairly good success with GaijinPot in the 2-3 times I\\'ve used it so maybe I wouldn\\'t discount it completely.\\n[High school sounds nice. I imagine most of your classes are the same so you only have to do one lesson plan for a multitude of classes? Four of the classes I teach now are Business TOEIC and one of the things I love about it is not having to work on four different lesson plans every week. I imagine there\\'s a little less freedom in a high school though, am I right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuqxvv?context=5)|Actually I say high school but actually my school contains both a junior high and high school since it\\'s affiliated with a university (so the students stay on track all the way to uni)\\n |That being said, really I teach all 3 grades of junior high and 2 grades of high. The high school grades are also subdivided based on academic track. It can get a little complicated but basically the classes can get quite different from one another. Nothing you probably couldn\\'t adapt to though.\\n[That\\'s cool. The college I\\'m at now has the same setup, with a private junior/senior high connected to the college and graduate school.  I\\'m just going crazy coming home to piles of laundry, dirty dishes, and cooking to do when all I want to do is chill. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/churen7?context=5)|I couldn\\'t empathize with that sentiment more. But chilling also gets boring after a while for me. That\\'s why I joined a kendo club.\\n[I wanted to join the uni\\'s kyudo club, but apparently they took the national championship last year and aren\\'t really set up for taking on beginners.

I\\'m outside of Nagoya, contracted out, multiple elementary schools. Why did you go from college to high school? I\\'d imagine the college gig would have been better.

I\\'m traveling solo for once so I\\'m not sure what to expect on my own. I\\'m currently learning Kanji through Heisig\\'s \"Remember the Kanji\" Book. Hopefully it will be of some help while I\\'m there but I wouldn\\'t bet on it.  I\\'ll be moving around a bit starting in Tokyo, Shizuoka, Kyoto, Osaka and Nara then back to Tokyo. Mainly staying in various hostels for the most part.  I can\\'t shake the feeling but I feel extremely uneasy or unsure if I\\'m prepared enough. I can comprehend basic conversations but I have no actual experience speaking though.  Is there anything I should be mindful of during my stay?  I\\'m uncertain how to deal with things like laundry, how the train\\'s pass system works, or how I should go about getting a simcard for data on my phone (is free wi-fi widely available?\\\\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuw06n?context=5)|Well, people on the whole here are very friendly, and many people who might see you struggling to get around will probably go out of your way to try to help you (also because perhaps they want to practice their English). Things like laundry, train pass and such you could probably look up really easily. Coin laundries can be found in many locations in most cities and train stations usually have English speaking staff who can help you get one. I recommend getting a train pass car (like Suica) instead of buying a ticket every single time you travel. Youll need a separate ticket for the bullet train though. Not sure about simcards since I have a Japanese phone but I heard you can find them quite easily. Free wifi is plentiful in cities but not everywhere unfortunately. \\n[Why do the Japanese take so many pictures? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chv0smo?context=5)|So they can blog about it^^\\n[Do you think anyone would be interested in hiring someone who can teach both English and Spanish? I hear native English speakers are the most wanted, but then I have a Japanese friend who is an English teacher, so... :x Also, who should I contact first? Thanks in advance!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chv0p1r?context=5)|Many Eikaiwa English conversation schools offer multiple languages, so I would say that\\'s your best bet for having a chance to teach two languages. I have some friends who teach both English and Thai for example. As for a good company that offers Spanish, I\\'m not really sure :X, I guess try goggling for those kinds of companies? \\n[Did you teach in America befor leaving for Japan, and if you did, is the sterotype about asians working so much harder than any other race true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chutjfa?context=5)|Never taught in America. Graduated uni and went straight to Tokyo.\\n |Working for a Japanese company is pretty brutal. I know many people who work 12 or more hours a day plus overtime, 6 days a week, and the overtime if more often than not compensated as much as you expect. Furthermore paid holidays are offered, but not many people take them because its looked down on socially. people dont want to pass a burden onto other people.  So yeah all the stuff about salaryman, and such is more or less true in many cases.\\n[I\\'m living in Canada atm, and I\\'ll be finishing university in about a year. What would be the best company to start looking at in your opinion? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chvaoje?context=5)|Depends where you want to live. My advice would be go to a website like GaijinPot.com or some other job listing website and look for options that will offer you a work visa and bring you over. I worked for a company called IES (International Education Services) back in Tokyo. I found them through a friend while I was studying in America. They contracted me out to many different Elementary schools. They also provided teachers training to me. It was tough for somelike like me with no teaching experience, but they trained me well.  [Link to www.iesnet.co.jp](http://www.iesnet.co.jp/english/)\\n |Since youll be finishing in a year, I also recommend JET since their application period is one year. If you apply nowish you\\'ll find out if you got the job around this time next year. \\n[Chinese-American here. You\\'ve answered a few questions about being a white American being treated as a foreigner in Japan, but how would someone like me be treated if I taught English there?  I\\'d look kinda like them, and I\\'m a native English-speaking American.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chv5sa5?context=5)|Just my guess and a generalization, but being American will give you some points. Looking Chinese will maybe take some points away, since Japan and China\\'s relations are pretty meh right now. I\\'m sure that after people know you are American, they will treat you with some of the same wonder they treat most Americans.\\n |I have some Chinese American friends here and they aren\\'t treated that much differently than most foreigners. \\n[Is the fact that \"Kyoto\" is an anagram of \"Tokyo\" appreciated in Japan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chvosvk?context=5)|I\\'m not sure that any Japanese person I know is aware of that! I think it\\'s pretty cool actually, I never noticed that before. What I can tell you is that people from my area (kansai) and people from the Tokyo area (kanto) don\\'t really like each other that much. Kind of like how Northeastern us people make fun of the south and vice versa. Maybe if they found out about that anagram, they\\'d be pissed, haha.\\n[How did you go about actually finding the job/applying for a job? I aim to go there once I graduate but I have no idea how to start.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chvbp0c?context=5)|One of my professors in America recommended a company to me.  It was this one [Link to www.iesnet.co.jp](http://www.iesnet.co.jp/english/)\\n |Also you can use Gaijinpot.com or other job listing websites based in Japan. Just make sure you find somebody whos willing to hire overseas and provide you a visa. Most companies will help you get settled here. \\n[Man, I\\'m upset I missed this. If you are still there I am traveling to Japan in September. Tokyo mainly. Any suggestions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuva1v?context=5)|Suggestions of places to go? If you\\'re in Tokyo you should check out kamakura, thats a nice town. Other good cities, Yokohama, Kyoto (;D), Kobe, Fukuoka, Hiroshima and Nara. If you\\'re mainly in Tokyo then you don\\'t really have to see Osaka. \\n[How long did it take you to be fluent in japanese?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chva9cg?context=5)|I wouldn\\'t say I\\'m native fluent by any means, but maybe conversationally fluent took me about a year or so of intensive language study here in Kyoto. \\n[Isn\\'t Onigiri the best thing ever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuwcgu?context=5)|Well considering how many different flavors it comes in, it\\'s pretty awesome. Eating it everyday however... gets a little old. I prefer MelonPan^^\\n[Do you ever or did you ever tried to get scammed out on prices of things because they thought you were ignorant about currency?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chvk62v?context=5)|Never. Japanese people don\\'t roll that way. They always treat the customer with respect, even if they don\\'t want to.\\n[Are the requirements strict for teaching abroad? I\\'ve considered doing it as well, though probably in Europe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chvqys7?context=5)|Maybe stricter in Europe than japan I would imagine. All you need here to get started is an undergraduate degree. \\n[Have you ever been on the receiving end of a Kancho game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chvl9g5?context=5)|More times than I am willing to admit publicly ><\\n[JET program? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuwtmo?context=5)|Not JET, contracted through a company. \\n[Hey! I\\'m a college student who is traveling to Kobe, Japan this June for a study abroad trip. My final project involves interviewing those who\\'ve emigrated to Japan, whether it be through the JET program, or otherwise. Would you be okay with either a Skype interview, or an in-person interview when I\\'m overseas in June? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuvfxq?context=5)|Sure no problem!\\n[Burger King!!:D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chvj7ll?context=5)|Fun fact: my last name is King and the only other foreign teacher in my school is Burger... Guess how long it took for the students to figure that one out ^^\\n[How does it feel being in a better country? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26uz91/i_am_an_american_teaching_at_a_private_high/chuq2ii?context=5)|I\\'m very happy to live in Japan, but it would be a lie if I said there wasn\\'t anything I miss about the U.S..
