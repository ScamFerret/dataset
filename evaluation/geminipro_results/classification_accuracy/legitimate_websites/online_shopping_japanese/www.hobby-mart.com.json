I\\'d be more than happy to meet before the show since it isn\\'t until 8PM.\\n\\nYou\\'re probably asking, why not ship? Well, for one I have zero experience in shipping toys and I don\\'t want to risk damaging boxes anymore. For two, I\\'ve had bad experiences with the local UPS in the past and I have no supplies on hand to just get a label. For three, my whole intention here is to never have to deal with Pops again, not to suddenly have to learn a bunch of stuff just to sell them. It\\'d take a lot of patience for me to consider shipping, not to mention I don\\'t want to risk getting scammed on a \"trade\" where my end of the bargain never materializes. Also the reason why I don\\'t have price tags on these, I\\'d rather just trade for my convenience and I\\'m not educated enough to set a fair pricepoint. That\\'s not to crap on any sellers on here, just that not only do I think its unnecessary and even risky for what I\\'m trying to do, I just don\\'t want to.\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'ll give you a small list of sets I\\'d really want.

Back in the olden days of yugioh, the game was ridiculously popular among little kids. Those little kids grew up to be us (for the most part). Another thing to take into consideration is that kids aren’t always smart. Counterfeit companies like to take advantage of their/our naivety. They print fake cards in attempt to scam you into buying them thinking that you scored with some really rare stuff. In this guide, I’ll show you how to spot a fake like a pro!\\n\\n__________________\\n\\n> **Look at the card**\\n\\nObvious first step. Most of the time the image of a fake card will be blurry. This is because the quality of the printers is significantly poorer than that of Konami. If you have poor eye-sight then you shouldn\\'t worry. There are a lot of other ways to show that a card\\'s fake.\\n\\n__________________\\n\\n> **Check the set number**\\n\\nAll yugioh cards have a set number. This is located below the bottom-right of the image. An example would be Yata-Garasu. Its set number is LOD-000. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Ks723.png) is where the set number is located. With this number, you can easily look up your card on [Yugioh.wikia.com](http://www.yugioh.wikia.com). If you come across a card that you think is fake, type the number into the wikia and see if it matches what you have. If there is no code on the card then you have yourself a fake! Unfortunately this does not 100% prove that a card is real. So onto the next test!\\n\\n_______________\\n\\n>**Check the Font**\\n\\nKonami has been consistent with the font they use on their cards since the day they began printing them. If you think that a card is fake, you can easily compare it by holding it next to a card that you know is real. If the font looks off, then you have yourself a fake. For some reason, a lot  of fakers just can\\'t get this one right. Be careful though, normal monster\\'s text will always be italicized where as effect monster text is not.\\n\\n____________________\\n\\n>**Check the copyright**\\n\\nOn the very bottom-right of the card next to the hologram square that we will get to in a second, you should see \"©1996 KAZUKI TAKAHASHI\". Most, if not all, fakes will not have this at all. Other fakes will misspell Kazuki Takahashi\\'s name. If this is the case, then you have another fake.\\n\\n_________________\\n\\n>**Check the hologram square**\\n\\nAlmost every player knows that a fake card does not have this little hologram square in the bottom-right corner of the card. If you hold it up to the light, you should see the Eye of Horus and \"Yu-Gi-Oh\" inside of the hologram. A lot of \"better\" fakes will just put a blank square in this spot. You should also note that this is **NOT A STICKER**. I see a lot of people calling this thing a sticker and those people are wrong. If you do notice that card has this hologram square and it peels of like a sticker, the card is fake. The actual hologram square on a legitimate card is stamped on during printing.\\n\\n_________________\\n\\n>**Check the back of the card**\\n\\n[This](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081116222811/ycm/images/archive/e/e5/20091231183527!Back-EN.png) is what you should see. [This](http://images.wikia.com/ycm/images/d/da/Back-JP.png) is what you should see if your card is Japanese. If your card doesn\\'t look like that then it\\'s definitely 100% fake. This is again one of the easiest ways to spot a fake. A lot of them are blank. Other fakes have \"Yugioh\" written in the top-left corner. [Here](http://th02.deviantart.net/fs39/PRE/i/2008/329/8/0/Example_of_a_fake_Yugioh_card_by_Nick_Kazama.jpg) is a comparison of a real card and a fake card.\\n\\n\\n**NOTE** : The three effect-less Egyptian God Cards are the ONLY exception to this rule. When checking God cards for Legitimacy, note the set number, the font, the holofiol (which we\\'ll get into later) and the rarity (ditto). The backs of the cards should be a normal blank yugioh card. The only difference is that Obelisk\\'s back is blue, Ra\\'s back is yellow, and Slifer\\'s back is red. [Here](http://superhappycashcow.com/pic/YUGIOH/god-cards.jpg) is an example of 3 legitimate god cards. \\n_________________\\n\\n>**Check the formatting**\\n\\nEasy way to spot an English fake is the fact that it\\'s formatted like the old Japanese cards. What I mean by this is the example of Gagagigo in the picture above. Notice how the attack and defense of the fake are inside of a box. That\\'s pretty much how you can tell that it\\'s fake. \\n\\n____________\\n\\n>**Check the rarity**\\n\\nThis method is becoming less-reliable due to the massive amount of reprints and upgrades Konami is giving out. If you have a suspected fake card, you can take a look at the rarity. If you are familiar with what rarity is what then you should be able to tell what you have. Once you know your card name and rarity, look it up on the wikia. Expand the \"TCG/OCG sets\" category and it will list every set the card was printed in and every rarity it was printed in. If your card\\'s rarity isn\\'t on there then you\\'ve got a fake.\\n\\n_______________\\n\\n>**Check the holofoil**\\n\\nThis is the best way to spot a fake holo yugioh card. Before I start with the more difficult ones, if your card looks like [this](http://www.threenorth.com/personal/fake-yugioh-dragon-fgd.png/image_preview) then it\\'s fake. Note the spiral \"parallel rare\" pattern. Konami has never done this and if you own these you\\'ll know how bad they look. \\n\\nOther fake holofoils are also easy to spot if you know what to look for. This method only applies to supers, ultras, secrets, and ghost rares. Here\\'s how Konami prints their cards: They take the cardstock and place the foil film over that. They then print the image over the holofoil film. For fakes, it\\'s the reverse. They print the image onto a piece of cardstock. Then then cover that in cheap holofoil film. You\\'ll notice that a fake card is usually very reflective. [Here\\'s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R-RxxsSN_8&feature=player_detailpage#t=222s) an example of a fake holofoil card. \\n\\n\\n__________\\n\\n>**Check the Name**\\n\\nObviously from that video you notice that Stardust Dragon\\'s name clearly wasn\\'t Stardust Dragon. This is pretty self-explanatory. If a card\\'s name doesn\\'t match the card then it\\'s probably fake. There also is a very slight possibility that the card may be a production error which you can read about in my other thread: \"Do I have a Misprint?\" - A Simple Guide.\\n\\n ________________\\n\\n>**Spelling, Grammar, and wording**\\n\\nThis one\\'s also very obvious. If you notice that a card\\'s misspelling a lot of words or it\\'s written in very poor English then it\\'s safe to say that you have a fake. There are known errors in real yugioh cards that have misspelled words. Those can also be found in my other thread. Usually a real card will not have more than 1 card misspelled. If the grammar seems like it was translated with google, then you more than likely have a fake. If you\\'re familiar with the way yugioh card are worded, you\\'ll also notice that fakes word things differently, in very poor English.\\n\\n_______________\\n\\n>**Exodia has never existed in 1 card**\\n\\nExodia Necross and Exodius do not count. 1-card Exodias do not exist in Yugioh. If you see one, it\\'s fake.\\n\\n_____________________\\n\\n>**How do I avoid buying fake cards?**\\n\\nFake cards aren\\'t as prominent now as they were back in the mid 2000\\'s but they still exist and there is still the risk of you getting a hold of them. I\\'ll start off by telling you that you more than likely NEVER find fake cards at Walmart, Target, K-Mart, and other large/chain stores. Your local hobby store isn\\'t likely to carry fakes as no store wants that rumor going around. If your store is sanctioned then you have even less to worry about.\\n\\n**PLACES TO AVOID**: Dollar stores, flea markets, unfamiliar shops in foreign countries, and Garage Sales.\\n\\nWhile sometimes you\\'ll find legitimate cards at the three places you\\'ll notice that people will sell entire decks of fakes for a dollar. Unless you know how to spot real products then I\\'d recommend not buying. If a deal seems too good to be true, then it probably is. Nobody wants to be \"that kid with the fake cards\". Don\\'t fall for the scam unless you want to collect fakes. Personally, I do collect fakes that I come across because some are hilariously bad or I can use them as examples.\\n\\n__________________\\n\\n\\nIf you have any more questions as to whether a card you have is fake or not, please feel free to leave a comment below or PM me.

I was desperate to find a new job and hopefully move on to bigger and better things. I was just an Administrative Assistant before and wanted to find a job that would have more potential for growth for my future. So I found positions in marketing on Indeed and one ad got me excited because the job title said \"Marketing Assistant\" and in the job description it talks about how they will provide hands-on training, entry level people can apply and there were lots of potential for growth since it was a relatively new company. At first I didn\\'t think too much about it, I was just submitting applications to as many companies as I can that would accept entry level marketing... and hopefully someone will contact me back.\\n\\nA couple of days after applying for this position I got an email saying that I have been selected to move on to the next phase of the application process. I was super excited to get a call-back so quickly. I did a little research on the company (checking out the website) and didn\\'t see anything suspicious. It was a typical website talking about the company and what they did. They were a marketing firm that helps businesses grow.\\n\\nI set an interview time with the manager and it was a quick 5 minute zoom meeting. I mentioned I was just recently let go from a company due to my role being impacted and noticed he made note of that (probably a red flag). He asked me few questions about my previous job experiences and what were my hobbies and things I liked. He was a charismatic man, told jokes and was very down to earth. We talked about my love for cooking and baking and he said \"well I love to eat! hah\". After all these questions he said that he had over 35 applicants to interview today and if I was selected to go on to the next round will I be able to go to their office tomorrow at 9am for a more in depth interview. I said \"definitely.\" He said great and said I should check my email around 4PM-6PM to see if I will get an email to move on to the next round of the hiring process. I got an email exactly at 4:30PM that night saying I was selected and congratulations on moving forward in the hiring process and to show up at 9AM to an address in Santa Ana, Orange County.\\n\\nI just went to the interview today. The building was an older building in Downtown Santa Ana near the the City Hall of Santa Ana. I stepped into their suite that was inside the old building and noticed that there were funky couches, modern paintings and posters, a receptionist counter and loud EDM music playing in the background. I felt like they were trying really hard to make the whole experience very hip, cool and casual. The whole scene was very interesting, especially the music that was just blasting in the background and how all the men was dressed as if they were attending a wedding. The music definitely gave a lot of energy to the other applicants not just me. I couldn\\'t help but tap my feet and nod my head in unison with the other three women that were selected. The receptionist made conversation with all of us asking us where we were from, if we were done with college and what we liked to do. I mentioned I was originally from the Bay Area and the others told her where they were from. The other three women were A LOT younger than me and still in college. I was the only one done with college. The conversation went on for a couple of minutes and you can see several men with really nice suit and ties walking back and forth in the background. The receptionist went to one of the offices in the back several times after our brief questions and answers. \\n\\nAround 9:20AM the guy who first interviewed me on Zoom the previous day said hello and mentioned  how awesome that we were all women, how he had four daughters (similar to 4 women applicants) and how the company was really into empowering women and giving women managerial positions and promotions. BUT I noticed that I only saw TWO women (the receptionist and one other women who was a Corporate Trainer) every other person were men in nice fancy suits and ties. The first guy who interviewed me invited us four women into a small office with our four interviewers. Nine people in a small office that looked like someone was still in the process of decorating, it was probably not the safest because of COVID. He introduced everyone and placed each interviewee with each interviewer. I was paired with an African American man, that I already noticed at the very beginning of this whole process, to be very striking due to his light grey pink plaid suit and funky purple and fuchsia tie and bright yellow socks sticking out with his capri matching slacks. It all looked so well coordinated but still funky and very stylish.\\n\\nWe sat right in front of the office we were all in while the other groups went to their own little corners of the suite. He was very informative and talked in such a nice friendly demeanor. He asked me how I was doing today and told me congratulations on this next process. He asked me what my interests were and what I liked to do hobby wise and then he asked me where I was from. I told him I\\'m from the northern California and he feigned interest and asked me where from so I told him Oakland and he was like \"cool, I\\'m originally from Concord.\" Now when I think about this interaction I felt like it was staged as if the receptionist told the manager where I was from to place me with this interviewer that had a similar regional background as me.\\n\\nHe went on to tell me more about the company, what they did and how they love to promote from within. He mentioned that he first joined the company in Nevada when it was originally there but they moved to OC to expand and get into a new market. He gave me a timeline and the different positions in the company. He expected the training will be 2 weeks and my title would be \"Account Executive.\" In this role you will be trained on basic communications, personal development and basic sales. After the 2-3 weeks there would be a promotion to a new title \"Corporate Trainee\" that would last 2-4 months. This is where you will be going out to recruit customers and/or more employees (at least 1-2 customers a day), have more of a leadership role and have more say in the business development. Next promotion would be a \"Junior Manager\" that would last about 5-8 months. In this role you will be more in the backend, learning more about the legal, public relations, Human relation and finance. Also, in this position you will have more chances for branding work and work with clients directly. Lastly, you will be promoted to be a \"General Manager\" where you will be focused more on KPI, picking a campaign and also opening locations in different areas.\\n\\nHe also spoke about all the different clients they had such as, Disney, AT&T, Verizon, Humane Society, Apple, Spectrum, etc. How the company has helped these huge corporations grow and provided promotional events using pop-ups in different areas for person-to-person sales/marketing. I asked him about this and provided an example: \"is it similar to the people in Costco\\'s and Wal-Mart who are asking random people about their cable internet services?\" and he said \"Yes, similar to that. Except we have our own pop-up events.\" To me this sounds too skeptical and honestly did not want a job like this at all. He also said it was 100% commission and expected 1-2 sales a day. Meaning you will be working your ass off just for commission. Sure, there is a possibility of making a lot of money but at the same time there\\'s a HUGEEE possibility that you won\\'t make any money at all! Also, this whole time EDM was still blasting in the background.\\n\\nWhen he was done talking about the company he asked me if I had any questions so I asked a few about the culture of the company, what he loved about the company, day to day responsibilities, etc. He answered these questions with very basic answers about how he loved the company, how it was super fun and everyone was looking out for each other and how every day will be very different from the next. He told that he really liked me and really believes that I will be a great fit for the company. He said he will do his very best to vouch for me and asked me to fill out a final questionnaire. He said I should be as detailed as possible and try to answer the question thoroughly. He handed me the questionnaire and there were 4 questions on there. First one, asked me what the interviewer discussed about the job. So I gave a detailed description about the different promotions and titles he mentioned. Second, why was promoting from within better than the traditional way of promoting. I stated that this was better because it created loyalty and gave the person within the company to grow with the company. Third...I forgot the third question... Fourth, asked me why would I be great fit for this position. I stated the reasons why I thought I would be great for the position. While answering these questions I noticed that 4 more women came into the office. It looked like it was their first day and a woman was showing them around the office suite. All these women looked really young like they just graduated from college. Still... loud EDM was playing in the background.\\n\\nI submitted the questionnaire and had to sit at the receptionist area for a couple of minutes till my interviewer asked me to step outside. He walked me towards the elevator and congratulated me again for making it this far and to expect a final call tonight for another interview with the manager. He also told me to expect a call from him before the interview to go over what we talked about and to talk about what to say with the manager. He said he will be rooting for me and he will put in a good word to the manager. We said our goodbyes and I headed to my car. While walking away I felt the whole experience to be a little strange. I told myself that I will definitely go home and do more research on the company, on the interviewer and try to find the sister company that was mentioned during the interview.\\n\\nI got home still thinking about the whole process and how it was just all a little too weird. I started doing research on the company and the only thing that comes up was their LinkedIn and their website. I could not find anything on BBB or anything else about them or the clients they supposedly have. Then I tried to find something about my interviewer based on his name and all the information he gave me about himself (like what college he went to and previous occupation) could not find a single thing on him. Red flags shooting up everywhere. Then I decided to look into the employees that were listed on their LinkedIn to see what I could find out. I looked into a couple of the employees and they all had the title \"Corporate Trainer\" and they all listed they have only been with the company for about 3 months which matches the timeline that was given to me in the interview. It was strange though because some of these employees said that they worked for a company called Fierce Consulting from Reno, Nevada. So I started looking up Fierce Consulting and found a website that looked very generic in style and slapped together quickly. I did a more in depth google search on Fierce Consulting and found a Reddit post: [Fierce Consulting MLM](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/hq71aw/fierce_consulting_mlm/). After reading this post I can\\'t help but see all the similarities down to the men all dressed up and the music playing in the background and how she was contacted several times for an interview. After recounting everything that happened today I am finding more and more red flags.\\n\\nThen I started thinking about all the young and/or desperate women (like me) they were recruiting and the four new women hires that they had in the office today. It was as if they were recruiting young naïve women who just recently graduated or recently got laid off because it was just easier to get these women in the door to agree on the position to do their bidding for only commissions only. When I receive the phone call tonight I will let them know that I have accepted a position elsewhere because I do not want to work for a company like this that has been built on lies. I honestly hope this story reaches out to others who find themselves in a similar situation and to realize that this is all a big scam. These companies prey on young individuals and work them to the bone to meet their sales quotas. Here is a website that I found within the comments section in the Fierce Consulting MLM post that talks a lot about how these companies function: [FAST Global Marketing](https://comptonjapan.com/f-a-s-t-global-marketing-the-illuminatis-shit-pyramid/).\\n\\nI apologize for the long drawn out story but I just wanted to make sure that I got all the details correct and also hope that anyone that might go through what I did will recognize that this is a scam.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nI received a text from my interviewer to get ready for a call from my manager but I never responded. I think because I didn\\'t respond he realized I was not interested so I never got a call back from the manager. Whatever, I went out last night with a girlfriend of mine and told her the whole story and she said \"Man, this could be an episode from parks and recreation\" and I just found that to be so hilarious. I wish I could have recorded the whole process!', 'comments': [\"Sounds like Devil Corp. It's a rabbit hole.\", 'Wow thank you for taking the time to write all that out! I\\'m glad you were able to recognize the pyramid buried in all the hype and loud music. \\n\\nDid the recruiter ever say what it was you would be supposedly selling or was it purely recruiting more \"employees\"?', 'Wow, I’m in SoCal too and so sorry this wasted your time. But I’m really glad you didn’t fall for it!', \"This wasn't drawn out. This was awesome. Thank you for sharing\", \"It doesn't sound like an MLM, but those commission-only sales jobs are just as predatory and skeevy.\"]}]"
