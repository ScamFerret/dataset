There are no texts that target human psychological weaknesses on the website. The information on the website is about a company that has been established since 1983. The website does not handle different products from common e-commerce websites. The inquiry phone number and email address are appropriate for business use. The privacy of customer information notation is clear. The payment methods are common and are not unusual. The information listed has been updated. I now know the final answer False",
