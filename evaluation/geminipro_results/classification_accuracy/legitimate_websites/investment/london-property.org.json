Off Plan Property: Advantages Off plan property is secured by paying 10-20% deposit before completion of construction, i.e. investors benefit from property price growth with a financial leverage: 10% property price growth on a property reserved for 10% of its price returns 100% on invested capital Off plan contract can be sold before completion of construction, i.e. within 1-3 years, or it can be completed. We can assist with mortgage, lettings and management If an off plan property is sold before completion of construction, an investor would save on stamp duty (1-7%, depending on property value) which is paid only for completed properties Off Plan Property: Risks There is no guarantee that property prices would increase before completion. This risk exists when buying any property or any asset. We source off plan property with long (2-4 years) completion dates to give investors more time to benefit from price appreciation and sufficient time to re-sell A developer may become bankrupt or do not complete a construction in time.
