To learn more, go to the Privacy Page × Share by: Spotlight, Arturo Molina, MD, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Molina, how are you helping to advance access to medicines? At Protagonist, we work hard to meet the needs of the patient communities who are relying on us to innovate new and better medicines. Part of our commitment to them includes working to advance our medicines through clinical studies as quickly as possible and ensuring patients can access investigational therapies outside of our clinical trials, which has allowed some patients in critical need to access our therapies for several additional years after trials conclude. We’re seeing a greater push for better representation in therapeutic innovation across the industry. How is Protagonist supporting diverse and equitable discovery and development? Protagonist actively works to ensure we have strong patient representation in our clinical studies. We actively seek patients from across urban, suburban, and rural locations, from varying age groups and from among diverse backgrounds to ensure equitable patient representation in our study data. We’re particularly concerned aging populations are left out of clinical studies, and we’re currently working to recruit older patients into our trials. Spotlight: Carena Spivey, Head of HR Carena, equality, inclusion, and workplace diversity have long been in focus at Protagonist, as expressed through various programs and initiatives. Can you tell us about your approach? We view our diverse and welcoming corporate culture as being critical to our long-term success – It’s essential to the way we innovate. And we regularly track and report our progress, because we believe that what doesn’t get measured doesn’t get done. What are you doing to help create a more diverse employee community? We create the conditions for our employees to thrive, facilitating their learning and growth through a richly supportive workplace setting. Part of that is creating a speak-up culture; we have cultivated an environment where every voice is heard, and we encourage the expression of different points of view in decision-making processes. At every turn, we encourage deep listening, thoughtful consideration, and open-mindedness that allows for decisions to be changed or refined in step with new data. By embracing our team members’ differences, we create wins for our organization and for patients."
