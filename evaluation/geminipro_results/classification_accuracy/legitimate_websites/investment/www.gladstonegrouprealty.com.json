I don't think there's much you left out.\\n\\nOh, except for the time a resident passed away inside their apartment and wasn't discovered for weeks, after which nothing was communicated to the rest of the tenants at all (we only found out because someone actually watched responders take the body out and told the rest of us).  They did, however, keep all the exterior doors propped open for a few days with blower fans running to try and get the smell out.

I'm glad the security deposit was returned, just about in full (minus a few bucks for something), but I had issues for months that were just ignored despite repeated attempts at resolving.

I subleased one of their apartments years back… apparently the person I subleased it from (who was the initial renter) didn’t do things correctly, and I was unaware. So when the apartment complex found out that it had been subleased, instead of coming to me and asking me, they decided to ask my neighbors about me. Come to find out I knew (rather well) one of my direct neighbors, who was questioned by the staff of the apartment complex (Cole group realty) about me. He said that they accused me of being a prostitution (they had no idea he knew me). which I have done nothing of the sort.. I don’t have any traffic in and out my house EVER. I don’t even have company. At the time, the dog I had was not a social dog and it was literally just her and I. I never had visitors, I never even really left the house. so for them to have done that is just wild to me. Extremely unprofessional.
