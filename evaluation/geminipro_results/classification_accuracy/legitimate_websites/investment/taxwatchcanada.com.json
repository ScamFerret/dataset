Happy Clients TaxWatch has created several publications; venture into real-world tax, business and financial know-how: Ken’s Comments: CRA Does Not Like To Be Ignored True Story A Canadian corporation had sales over 1.5 million for one recent year but is now inactive. Trigger was pulled by CRA; this sales level automatically required the corporation to file GST quarterly (rather than annually). CRA sent notice of this requirement mid-year. Next, 4 days later, CRA issued high notional (estimated) assessments for GST for the first two quarters. Just like that. here Canada Wide Service We work with clients all over Canada Let’s talk!
