A while ago, the Right in this nation made our government pull out of \"positive propaganda\" -- thinks like Public Radio and the like.

The problem here is there\\'s no money to be made in the truth -- so the \"free\" information has the intention of manipulating sentiment as the product.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the ONLY problem. We also allowed the slow creep of a 5th column to subvert our Democracy. Things like News Corp were set as a \"loss leader.\" A well known fascist from Australia and others like a certain prince who was a major investor who funded both hate speech towards Muslims, and Muslim madrassas that were anti-American and linked to terrorism.
