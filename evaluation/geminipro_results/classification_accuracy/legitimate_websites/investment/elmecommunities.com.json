Additionally the text on the website does not target human psychological weaknesses and there is no information on non-existent companies. The website does not handle different products from common e-commerce websites and the inquiry phone number and email address are appropriate for business use. The privacy of customer information notation is clear and the payment methods are common and usual. Finally the information listed has been updated."
