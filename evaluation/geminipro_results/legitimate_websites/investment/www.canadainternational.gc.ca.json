Tonight, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This is a war of aggression on a peaceful, democratic country and a longtime ally of Canada.\\n\\nCanada has a close connection to Ukraine. After Russia, we are home to the greatest number of ethnic Ukrainians outside the homeland. Many Ukrainian-Canadians are here because their ancestors — in Canada’s early days, thousands of Ukrainians left their homeland to build a new life in the Canadian prairies.  The 2016 census indicated Canada is 4% Ukrainian (Alberta 9%, Saskatchewan 13%, and Manitoba 15%). Likely, many more have roots that go back to Ukraine as well.\\n\\nCanada offered Ukrainians freedom and a new home. The prairies were a similar environment to that of Ukraine, governed by fairer leaders. Waves of immigration followed first the emancipation of serfdom (many Ukrainians who came to Canada were former serfs — property of a lord — under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), and then following the Holodomor genocide (an engineered famine which starved millions of Ukrainians).\\n\\nWhile many Canadians don\\'t have Ukrainian heritage, they share a similar story. Our country has welcomed waves of people from all over the world seeking the promise of Canada: freedom. Now, we watch attacks fall on Ukraine\\'s sovereignty — and by extension, our collective belief in freedom. This is a critical point for all Canadians.\\n\\nBe vigilant. We understand wars to be conflicts fought with bombs, tanks, and guns. But this war will also be fought with information. Propaganda narratives, bots, flooding, and polarization over domestic Canadian issues are all tactics Russia can and will employ online. This is Canada\\'s national sub; we have 1.2 million members and we can expect to be the target of influencing campaigns.\\n\\n**The best thing you can do here is to think critically**. Evaluate information before you share it. If a report is unverified, don\\'t share it (or if you do, qualify it and make it clear that it\\'s not confirmed yet). Report suspicious activity. Engage respectfully and rationally; Russia\\'s tactic is to polarize and divide. In the meantime, the mods will be doing their very best to address bot activity and whatever brigades that come our way.\\n\\nThis is Canada\\'s national sub; as such, it stands for freedom and democracy. **We will not harbour Russian propaganda**. This is a serious situation and the mod team will be taking a strict approach to moderating on this topic. **Comments denying Ukrainian sovereignty, denying Holodomor, and associating Ukraine with neo-Nazism will be removed and will possibly result in bans**.\\n\\nCanada will undoubtedly face great challenges in the coming days, weeks, and months. Help us keep this space productive.\\n\\nFeel free to use this megathread to link news and discuss your thoughts. We won\\'t be removing Canada-related news on the sub proper, but there will be lots of international news in the coming days that won\\'t be suitable for r/Canada\\'s feed. But by all means link developments and resources here.\\n\\n# Statements and Resources\\n\\n**Official statements**\\n\\n* Feb. 23[:](http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/images/ckeditor/images/%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0%20%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BD%D1%96-2.jpg) [Prime Minister Justin Trudeau](https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2022/02/23/statement-prime-minister-russias-attack-ukraine) \\\\- “Canada condemns in the strongest possible terms Russia’s egregious attack on Ukraine.\"\\n* Feb. 23: [Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly](https://twitter.com/melaniejoly/status/1496720539821428738?t=CqEXMjzJKY46GBLKBHII2g&s=19) \\\\- \"The team is safe and the embassy will offer consular services to Canadians from Lviv as long as possible.

Less than 3 hours later Russia began their invasion.\\n\\nUkrainian President Zelensky's speech before the invasion:^[[1]](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/23/zelenskys-desperate-plea-for-peace/)\\n\\n>I would like to address the citizens of Russia directly, not as president, but as a citizen of Ukraine, and I address the citizens of Russia as I would the citizens of Ukraine. We share a more than 2000 kilometer border. Your soldiers are stationed all along it, almost two hundred thousand soldiers, and thousands of military vehicles. Your leaders have chosen for them to take a step forward and into the territory of another country. And that single step could be the beginning of a great war on the European continent.\\n\\n\\n>The whole world speaks of what could happen day to day. A cause for war could arise at any moment. Any provocation, any incident, could be the flare of a fire that burns everything.\\n\\n\\n>You have been told that this flame will bring liberation to Ukraine’s people. But the Ukrainian people are free. They remember their own past and will build their own future. They build, they do not destroy, as they themselves have told you day after day on television. The Ukraine in your news and the Ukraine of real life are two entirely different places, and the difference is that the latter is real.\\n\\n\\n>They tell you that we’re Nazis. But how can a people that lost eight million lives to defeat the Nazis support Nazism? How can I be a Nazi? Say it to my grandfather, who fought in World War II as a Soviet infantryman and died a colonel in an independent Ukraine. They tell you that we hate Russian culture. How can one hate a culture? Any culture? Neighbors always enrich each other’s cultures. However, we are not part of one whole. You cannot swallow us up. We are different. But this difference is not a reason for enmity. We want to determine our own course and build our own history: peacefully, calmly, and honestly.\\n\\n\\n>They told you that I would order an attack on the Donbas, order indiscriminate shootings and bombings. This leads to some questions – some very simple ones. Who are we shooting at? What are we bombing? Donetsk, which I have visited dozens of times? Where I looked in people’s faces, in their eyes? Artyoma Street, where I strolled with friends? The Donbas Arena, where I rooted for our boys together with Ukrainian lads at the European Championships? Shcherbakov Park, where I drank with friends when our boys lost? Luhansk? Where the mother of my best friend is buried? Where his father also rests? Take note, that I am speaking to you all in Russian now, but no one in Russia knows the meaning of these places, these streets, these names, these events. These are all alien to you, unfamiliar.\\n\\n\\n>This is our land, and this is our history. What will you fight for and with whom? Many of you have visited Ukraine. Many of you have relatives here. Some might have studied at Ukrainian universities, and befriended Ukrainians. You know our character, you know our people, and you know our principles. You know what we value. So stop and listen to yourselves, to the voice of reason, to the voice of common sense.\\n\\n\\n>Hear us. The Ukrainian people want peace, as does their government. Not only do they want it, they demonstrate that desire for peace. They do everything they can. We are not alone: it is the truth that Ukraine is supported by many nations. Why? It is not about peace at any cost. It is about peace and principles, of justice, of international law. It is about the right to self-determination, that every person might determine their own future. It is the right of every society, and of every person, to security, to a life without threats. I am certain that these rights are important to you, as well.\\n\\n\\n>The truth is that this needs to end before it is too late. If Russia’s leadership does not want to meet us across the table for the sake of peace, perhaps it will sit at that table with you. Do you Russians want a war? I would very much like to know the answer, but that answer depends only on you, on the citizens of the Russian Federation.
