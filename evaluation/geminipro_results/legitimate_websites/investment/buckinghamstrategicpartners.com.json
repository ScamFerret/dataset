Partner at Delap Wealth Advisory Jared Siegel, BFA™, CEPA® \"Do We Buy It or Do We Build It?\" It’s a question every growing business faces. Clients are insisting on more services from advisory firms, and firms must adapt to meet those changing demands. At the intersection of those dynamics is time and scale. * As of March 31, 2022 BSP had $3.04 billion of discretionary regulatory assets under management and $15.46 billion of non-discretionary regulatory assets under management. In addition, BSP provides administrative, back-office and retirement plan services to $20.17 billion of assets managed or advised by the independent firms that hire BSP for its services. In the aggregate, the total number of assets under management or administration was $38.66 billion.
