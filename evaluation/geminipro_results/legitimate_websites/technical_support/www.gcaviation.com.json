If you are unsure of which region, you may find your nearest [Transport Canada Office](https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/civil-aviation-contacts-offices#headquarters_and_regional) and see which region it falls under.\\n\\n· Pacific Region 2010-7445 132 St. Surrey BC V3W 1J8 Tel.: 1-800-305-2059 [aviation.pac@tc.gc.ca](mailto:aviation.pac@tc.gc.ca)\\n\\n· Quebec Region 700 Place Leigh Capréol Dorval QC H4Y 1G7 Tel.: 1-800-305-2059 [aviation.que@tc.gc.ca](mailto:aviation.que@tc.gc.ca)\\n\\n· Atlantic Region P.O.

But what I can say with some authority is that if there's zero information on a plane crash, it isn't likely it happened. Few if any things are as well documented as plane crashes, and there are detailed records way back in time. 1979 is relatively recent in aviation history, believ it or not. HOW EVER: it does depend on the severity. If a bush flying Cessna makes a hard landing and busts a tire, it's not likely you'll find anything on it. If the crash is severe, with injuries and fatalities, you most likely will.\\n\\nI'll have a look around.\\n\\nEdit: [This](https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/228333) and [this](https://www.baaa-acro.com/zone/ontario?page=9) was all I could find. I've also listened to the interview you link to with her. What immediately makes me suspicious about the story is that she says the pilot decided to land weels up on a lake. Pilot's don't do that. They always land gear down (unless the gear is stuck or malfunctioning, obviously, but I highly doubt an aircraft has **both** double engine failure **and** gear failure. That doesn't happen).  The reasons for landing with the wheels down is obviously to make the landing as smooth and safe as possible, especially on an even surface, and if they're forced to brush trees on their way down, the gear helps absorb speed and energy and absolutely needs to stay down for that reason (even if it's torn off eventually). So from an aviation perspective, this story rings weird in my ears.\", '[deleted]', 'There was a comment that’s been deleted,  by someone who claimed to have  worked with her- not specific,  but acknowledged , para phrasing that there’s a strong  egoic personality to dr. Yvonne Kason. \\n\\nThe question for me is how to resolve what the barometer is for authenticity. These experiences ( including my own) are at best hard to believe! So when there’s an ego driving the story I have to wonder how much is the storyteller and how much is the story? \\nI generally love the humbleness of NDE reports- the diversity of experiences/experiencers is with generally a humility and often anonymously told. \\n\\nNow , there’s a market for this- money can be made. What does that mean? That’s for me to continue to discern. No easy answers.', 'In 1996, there was a massive investigation that I was a small part of. The investigation happened in two different states and covered 4 murders. At the time, the news about it was all over the Western US. \\n\\nI\\'ve only been able to find a tiny handful of articles about it. That\\'s 1996, mind you... much less trying to find information about \"missing persons\" in 1977. I know that my grandparents and others made a LOT of noise about it. \\n\\nThe internet was in general use around 1993, two years after it was finally open to public use. Even then, \\'general use\\' was very low. Not remotely, not slightly, not even a bit close to what it is now. A lot of people didn\\'t even know what that \\'www\\' thing on commercials was until the late 1990s... and then it was mostly early adults. \\n\\nThe point is to give you a little clarity about how very PRIMITIVE 1979 was compared to our current paradigm. If there was some local coverage, but not a lot, then chances are that you won\\'t find anything at all. While a lot has been done to bring those historic times onto the internet, the harsh reality is that most of it is gone. \\n\\nAccidents, not even ones that took lives, may easily not be online. If the person wasn\\'t some important bigwig, and/or the person\\'s family doesn\\'t know how to use the internet AND they didn\\'t keep information... you may not be able to find it. \\n\\nI\\'ve tried desperately to find information about my fiance who \"died at sea\" in what the police thought was a murder... but I haven\\'t been able to find anything out about him at all. Despite News coverage at the time. That was in the mid 1990s. \\n\\nSo, I\\'m sorry, but \"lack of information from an obscure accident in the late 70s\" is low on the list of \"why something isn\\'t believable\" imo. Things I personally lived through that were HUGE news stories at the time, I often can\\'t find any reference to. Not so much as an obituary. \\n\\nAnd the hate-on that so many people have for people who make money is creepy to me. It\\'s like a \"I\\'m better than you because I\\'m poor\" and it feeds the weird poverty fetish that certain religions push extremely hard. \\n\\nPoverty and giving up your last penny as if you\\'re a saint is deified far too much.']}]"
