After the Glock-17 becomes Austria\\'s standard-issue military pistol, he sells his weapon in crime-ridden America – where he teams up with a frustrated journalist-turned-marketer.\\n\\nAny feedback welcome.

According to NY Times, they\\'re responsible for 400 to 1000 contract killings.\\n\\nWhy not just call it \"GLOCK\" or \"WIDE OPEN ARMS\" or something?', '**Part 1 of 2 (continued in the following comment)**\\n\\nHey! What a cool concept, and right up my alley as a former journalist and someone who *really* has a pet peeve for biopics/based-on-a-true-story media that is lazy, inaccurate, or both. I think your overall idea (a biopic anthology specifically about weapons of death) is inspired, especially with the proven success of things like *American Crime Story* and *Oppenheimer*. For your timing alone, you should give yourself a high five!\\n\\nThat being said, I\\'ve gone through your pitch deck, and I\\'m most of the way through your teleplay. I have some various thoughts, but feel free to do with them as you\\'d like. The most important TL;DR is that there is *absolutely* something here, but you owe it to your audience and your subject matter to be **less indulgent** and **more focused.** Because right now this is a truly unique, marketable, and fascinating true story buried underneath a generic, atonal, and baffling pile of fictional additions and author choices.\\n\\n**Pitch Deck Thoughts:**\\n\\n* This overall doesn\\'t work for me. It comes off as scattered and amateurish; I sincerely do not know what half of your images mean, and they actually drag down what is at its core a well-researched, confident, and unique screenplay. Please consider working with a graphic designer or just taking a step back before sharing this professionally.\\n* To wit: Your (primary)/(abstract) character details are very Screenwriting 101; no one would need that spelled out. And hell, you make me actively *un*interested in knowing more about Vince with this explanation.\\n* I have to give you credit for your letter near the end of the pitch; it\\'s honest, and direct, and well-written. It\\'s the type of thing we hear in stories about Tarantino and Smith breaking into their Directorial debuts. And there\\'s a chance it could work for you too. But I think it\\'s *incredibly* damaging to the integrity of your story. It\\'s indulgent, and it robs your work of the chance to speak for itself. And most importantly, you tip your hand about the biggest issue I\\'d have concerning this project.\\n* One of your two central characters is, by your own admission, a **wholly-fictional character and an author insert.** This is *disastrous* for a variety of reasons, at least for the project I thought this would be (and compared to the successful examples I shared at the start of this post). I\\'ll elaborate more in the screenplay section, but I must repeat: **Please take a long look at why you believe this is the way to tell this story and adapt Paul M. Barrett\\'s work.**\\n\\n**Screenplay thoughts:**\\n\\n* So here\\'s the good news: You are confident in your choices, and often make interesting ones. I like your character descriptions, I like your playful scene-setting and subheads. I get shades of Shane Black, Guy Ritchie, and the post-2000s anachronistic approach to writing historical events (Big Short, Wolf of Wall Street, etc.) in your style. With the right story, this could really lead to something special.\\n* I have a variety of cuts and stylistic changes I would recommend, but they\\'re all basically versions of \"Get to the point of your scenes ASAP.\" I would, for example, recommend cutting everything up to Gaston and Otto meeting, and I would flip your series of events. Follow Gaston as he prepares his pitch in the mirror. Show us Austria by foot or by car. Have Gaston try to test his charm on the armed guards, and that\\'s how we could get their comments about guns. Then we could reveal that he\\'s here...to sell *knives*. Drop the entire apple-slicing scene, or integrate it into their wider talk about Austria\\'s irrelevancy, because **that is how you tell your audience about this unfamiliar setting.** Treat your scenes and characters with purpose, and you\\'ll be surprised at how fast they can move.\\n* Now for some less good news: I don\\'t know why you chose this story. I have a hunch, though: You wanted to marry a lifelong interest and passion (guns) with a lesser-known true story (the Glock) to make something special. That\\'s a GREAT impulse, and once again: You should give yourself a high five for this mix of subject and medium. But I\\'ve worked on nonfiction adaptations; I\\'ve published them, too. And what I see here (and I hope I\\'m wrong) is very common: **You didn\\'t want to do the research.**\\n* *American Crime Story*\\'s OJ Simpson season works because it uses an exhaustive amount of research to suss out the emotional truth between the big moments of public figures that anyone who followed the trial knew already. *Chernobyl* works because even though some relatively major liberties are taken (including the creation of a totally-fictional character as a proxy for several other real people), it takes great pains to root itself in the authenticity of what\\'s most unfamiliar to the audience: The world and structure of the Soviet Union in the 1980s.\\n* On a top-floor level, you seem uninterested in too many real people. You have a visceral cutaway with an FBI Agent, Jamar Jackson, who isn\\'t real. (But the real Jamar Jackson *was* a Black teen wrongfully interrogated *by* the FBI a few years ago. So...that\\'s a weird choice to make.) William Webster is real, but once again has his intro tied to a fictional trauma. Otto Rosch is real...*and a Nazi,* which you fail to bring up. Gaston Glock is obviously real, too. But not 10 minutes into your pilot, you\\'ve leaned into this confusing mix of fictional and factual, seemingly based on your whims and whatever would be convenient to the plot. Let me explain why that doesn\\'t work for me by examining your intro.\\n* This is 2 minutes of *insanely* disorienting stylized noise. We open with mannequins watching a 1950s TV; SMASH CUT to footage of Charleton Heston; SMASH CUT to stock footage of a...Black girl about to shoot up a school, or something? SMASH CUT to invented news anchor footage.\\n* Let me reiterate: You have **THREE SEPARATE SMASH CUTS ON A SINGLE PAGE: YOUR** ***FIRST*** **PAGE.**\\n\\n*(To be continued)*', 'I thought it was a good read. I like the pink on black.\\n\\nCongrats on the 8 from the blklst btw. Did producers or managers reach out to you?', \"It felt very wordy right off the bat for a pitch deck. I want to see a log line first\\n\\nHere's what I more expect from a pitch deck, from a film I recently funded: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wW9gCsqAa7QZ82BLPjTJ5qpHOgo2fpJ_/view\\n\\nThe important part, if pitching to individual investors, is getting your investor excited about the work. I don't necessarily care about the characters until I'm already bought in. The rest is details.\\n\\nRobert's case here is a little different, as he is actually the one man army who makes these films. Part of what I'm paying attention to is his tech demonstrations. But still, you get the point.\", 'First and foremost, I think this is a great idea.  It reminds me of the recent Netflix show, Painkiller.  Examining the root causes of our gun epidemic is both provocative and entertaining. I disagree vehemently with anybody that says that these subjects should be avoided for fear of politics.\\n\\nI found the pitch deck a bit all over the place though.  The imagery was not cohesive and you have way too comps imo.  I think you’re going for something Fincher-esque based on the little bit of the pilot I read a la Mindhunter.  Mindhunter meets Painkiller meets Air feels like an assemblage of comps that my mind can grasp.  But you know your show way better than I do.  I’d keep perfecting the pitch deck, but you have something very special here once you pare down your vision and solidify your tone.\\n\\nMake sure you have an option or shopping agreement for the book at the ready.\\n\\nMURDER INC. isn’t my favorite title either.

(“EWS” or “the Company”), is pleased to announce that it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Advent Technologies Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:ADN) (“Advent”) for deployment of Methanol-based fuel cells and development of large-scale plants that will generate green methanol.\\n\\nEWS has a proprietary and patent pending Advanced Thermolysis Technology that generates valuable products from carbon-based waste material, including that generated by the agriculture and forest industries. As a by-product of the creation of our carbon products we also generate biogas. Through our recently signed MOU with Hago Energetics of Southern California, we have access to a breakthrough technology that can economically convert our biogas into green methanol. While methanol is used to make a variety of chemicals, it is also a unique fuel source: stable, safe to containerize, and safely transportable with existing infrastructure.\\n\\nImportantly, Advent has led the way in creating the next generation of highly efficient hydrogen fuel cells that can operate with pure hydrogen in addition to other fuels such as NG, LPG, and e-fuels or other hydrogen carriers. Significantly, our green methanol is one such fuel.\\n\\nThe volumetric energy density of methanol is about three times higher than compressed H2 (700 bar) and two times higher than liquid H2. One litre of methanol actually contains more hydrogen than one litre of liquefied H2. This makes green methanol a much more efficient delivery medium of hydrogen to a fuel cell, than containerized hydrogen itself.\\n\\nKey terms of the MOU, which is subject to a definitive agreement, are:\\n\\nThe MOU is related to establishment of a collaboration of employing EWS’ and Advent’s respective technologies for producing, storing, and selling methanol and Green Hydrogen.\\n\\nEach of the parties will operate independently but will collaborate to transform carbon-based waste materials and providing it to Advent for its fuel cells.\\n\\nAdvent, where reasonable, will use EWS as a non-exclusive fuel source provider for Advent fuel cells requiring green methanol\\n\\nEWS will sell green methanol directly to Advent.\\n\\nThe MOU has a four-year term.\\n\\n\\nStates Kevin Hull, CEO of EWS, “We are tremendously excited about our MOU with Advent Technologies. Hydrogen Fuel cells have been held back from widespread use because of the challenges of creating hydrogen economically, storing it and transporting it safely, and delivering it to the fuel cells. Advent’s game-changing technology has solved all of these challenges. We believe that by generating green methanol and creating opportunities to employ Advent fuel cells, even at our own plants, our companies will be able to help facilitate the development of the Hydrogen-based economy.”\\n\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/emergent-waste-solutions-inc-advent-120000123.html', 'comments': ['Sweet news!!!']}]"
