Power distribution, nuclear instrumentation response, fuel management, and analysis of reactivity effects by PARCS-RELAP/TRACE coupled code system Probabilistic Safety Analysis Probabilistic safety analysis is applied at all stages in the lifetime of the NPP (design, operation, and lifetime extension). During the plant’s safety assessment, the probabilistic and deterministic safety analyses are used simultaneously so that to complement each other Multiphysics & CFD Simulation Providing advanced modeling and simulation solutions to the nuclear safety issues where a much finer resolution of the simulation tools is required. Solving problems with fluid flow by using numerical methods computationally. Predicting fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics during normal and emergency operation of the NPPs Seismic Safety Analysis Reviewing of the NPPs seismic hazard assessment, revision of the design bases, evaluation of vulnerability, and development of accident management capabilities of the NPPs Software Development ARIS and NUCMAT are software applications developed by NRSC to assist Regulatory Bodies in managing their regulatory activities connected with registration of sources of ionizing radiation, licensing of the use of sources, accounting of nuclear materials, registering and tracing inspections Project Management and Administration Planning and developing the project Idea,  creating and leading the project team, monitoring project progress and setting deadlines, solving issues, managing the money, ensuring stakeholder satisfaction, evaluating project performance Our Last Works S.
