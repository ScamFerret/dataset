DO NOT use any compatibility mode when installing this, if you do that then it will install some things we do not want because they are not compatible with windows 10 and 11. All we want is CyberView X for the scanning.\\n\\nNext download and install the trial version of [VueScan](https://www.hamrick.com/download.html). Dont worry, you dont need to pay for it (or open it more than once) we just need it for the drivers it comes with. Once its installed turn the scanner on and plug it in, wait a minute for windows to fail to recognize it and start VueScan (it will scream at you about incompatibility and point you towards the scanace site we already used, its fine just close it and the website it forces on you).
