I remember finding it back in 2011 and laughing at every episode. Somehow, this show made me feel less lonely. I stopped watching after season 3 (tried to watch season 4 when it aired but just couldn't get into it) but thanks to Netflix I finished the series about month ago. \\n\\nAfter some reflecting, the two moments I always think back to are the group singing about what Christmas means to them to save Abed and Annie talking to Abed in the locker about how he'll always fit in. Both those moments are so heartwarming to me and I really appreciate the show's emotional appeal !! \\n\\nSince the series finale, which moments have you guys always looked back on?\", \"The pillow blanket fort episodes were always my favourite in the series. The first one was just a great bond with Troy and Abed while showing how unique Harmons imagination went into possibilities for themes.\\n\\nThe second one wasn't as good with imagination, but it showed the growth of both characters very well and how the show overall was changing its form, and perhaps a sneak peak to the eventual season 5 goodbye of main characters. All the while having a great Historic Battle Narrative with it.\\n\\nSpeaking as someone who has gotten tired of sitcoms overall and their overused tropes, Community was always there to swing it out of left field and take you quite off guard.\", \"i rewatch Community episodes often, but not this one. It's too hard and too sad and hits a little too close to home.\", 'A moment of silence for Yahoo! Screen', 'The scene where Jeff drops off Abed and Annie Is the scene I cried a lot']}]"
