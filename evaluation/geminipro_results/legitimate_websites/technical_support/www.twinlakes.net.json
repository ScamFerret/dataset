Project Graduation is an overnight event the seniors participate in as their class gathers for one last time. Numerous items are given to the students during Project Graduation as a gift for their accomplishments and hard work over the past four years. Twin Lakes is proud to sponsor this event and would like to congratulate the Class of 2024 and wish them the best in their next chapter in life. Local School Support Twin Lakes recently visited all K-8 schools in our service area to present a check for these schools to further meet the needs of their students. Each school received $1.00 per student that was currently enrolled. Twin Lakes understands the importance of education in our rural areas and we’re proud to give back to our community! 5 6 7 8 Hours of Operation Monday through Friday — 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Support (24hrs/day) Customer Service *The Byrdstown business office is closed from 12:00 to 1:00 for lunch.
