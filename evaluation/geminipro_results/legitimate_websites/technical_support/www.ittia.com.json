Start free ITTIA DB trial Accelerate Innovation with ITTIA ITTIA is revolutionizing the future of embedded device data management on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) through its ITTIA DB line of advanced products. With ITTIA DB, you will reduce costs, accelerate innovation, and gain new competing power. ITTIA DB enables embedded systems to gain real-time insight into the system, continuously monitor live data, query for interesting events, and securely store information. Build mission-critical embedded systems with ITTIA DB and maximize edge device data computing. More Data-driven MPUs and ECUs Rely on ITTIA DB SQL ITTIA DB SQL, TSDB, is a hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) database enabling OEMs to first analyze and then store data workloads in a single library. It is designed for microprocessor (MPU) and electronics control unit (ECU) edge devices to process real-time data directly where it is generated at great speed and volume, leading to action-led results in real-time. ITTIA DB IoT Cost-Effective Database for MCUs ITTIA DB IoT, a TSDB with stream processing, enables applications to create data collection campaigns and real-time alerts with continuously executed queries. With high-performance incremental filtering, aggregation, windowing, temporal joins, and more, ITTIA DB IoT empowers microcontroller firmware to process data samples, manage time series workloads, and respond quickly. Ultra High-Performance Embedded Edge Data Computing 4x Ingestion Rate* 10x Query Rate* Data Export* * View Benchmark Edge Data with ITTIA DB Safety and Security Do you adhere to strict development practices that require evidence to confirm and certify that data management is correctly implemented in your product? ITTIA protects embedded edge device OEMs with advanced, integrated development practices. ITTIA DB enables OEMs to master embedded systems data management safety, security, reliability, and performance while adhering to industry standards. ITTIA's Customer Focus Experts At ITTIA, we help manufacturers to benefit from our software and know-how through consulting services to build and deploy safe, secure embedded systems that combine data management and real-time data processing.
