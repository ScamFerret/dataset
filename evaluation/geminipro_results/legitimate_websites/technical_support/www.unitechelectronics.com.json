More specifically I'm trying to understand it at this very step ([https://youtu.be/kRlSFm519Bo?t=297](https://youtu.be/kRlSFm519Bo?t=297)). Ben explains the internal divider of the 555 timer.\\n\\nI would like to note here that I'm totally noob and I'm not at all an electrical engineer or something similar. So, based on my schools knowledge (and based on what I can recall from back then, If I had a multi-meter and place it along each of those internal (5K) resistors I would take a value of 1.66666666667 Volts (Given that I supplied 5V total). \\n\\nThis value agrees also with the total 5V because multiplying the 1.66666666667V with 3 gives back 5Volts.\\n\\nSo what I'm trying to understand is why Ben notes that the volts in the negative input of the top comparator is 3.33V and not 1.66666666667V. \\n\\nIt seems that he takes as reference the Ground. But if you take as reference the +5V you should take 1.66666666667V. To be honest I think that someone will answer that if you take as a reference the +5V you will take -1.66666666667V but is this for real? If I use a multi-meter will I get back a minus sign?\", 'comments': [\"> It seems that he takes as reference the Ground.\\n\\nYeah, that's what a local ground *is* - the zero reference against which all other voltages in the circuit are compared, if you don't provide an explicit second node for comparison.\\n\\n> But if you take as reference the +5V you should take 1.66666666667V.\\n\\nYou mean -1.67v, ie negative :P\\n\\n> is this for real? If I use a multi-meter will I get back a minus sign?\\n\\nIf you put the black lead on 5v and the red one on the control pin, yes.\", 'https://www.unitechelectronics.com/NE-555.htm']}]"
