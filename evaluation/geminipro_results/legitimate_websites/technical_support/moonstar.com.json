I’m happy it finally came out, and being able to watch a movie in a theater again was nice.\\n\\nThe horror aspect was something fresh and fun for an X-Men movie that I enjoyed. It wasn’t the scariest movie by any means, and I’m not suggesting it was trying to be, but it had me on edge at certain points. The cast did a great job in their respective rolls and by the end I had an appreciation for each character that I didn’t start the movie with. I especially enjoyed how it ties in with Logan but maintains its identity as a stand-alone X-Men movie.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it wasn’t a very subtle movie. The love interest between Maisie and Moonstar was exhausting until it's officially acknowledged. The dilapidated building with the doctor who’s a little too nice just screamed bad intentions, and Moonstar’s ability to manifest peoples worst nightmares was kind of obvious. The pacing also felt sporadic at times and there were scenes with dialogue that had my eyes rolling such as, “What’s she in here for? Hopefully for being a nymphomaniac.” Says the guy clearly hiding behind his manly facade because come to find out later he literally can’t be intimate with anyone without killing them.\\n\\nAs another person said, if this had come out 2-3 years prior it would possibly see more success. I think between the pandemic and what is actually wrong with the movie though, it won’t be wowing many people.\\n\\nEdit: A couple words\", 'Gotta agree with Sunspot. I, too, would like to marry Anya Taylor-Joy.', \"Anya Taylor-Joy is so much better than everyone else in this it's borderline hilarious.\", \"I saw this movie at a drive-in theater (support them!!!) and it was honestly so...cursed? Like it had such a weird feeling throughout because it was clearly such a product of 2017 when Stranger Things and Game of Thrones were much bigger franchises and The Witch was a newer film and these young actors were the same age. Now, it holds up, and it's a decent atmospheric superhero movie with a bit of edge to it but it feels time displaced\"]}, {'title': 'Dani Moonstar getting a buff, Lady Deathstrike largely unchanged, Shocker buff bugged so delayed another month', 'subreddit': 'ContestOfChampions', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ContestOfChampions/comments/17f0gji/dani_moonstar_getting_a_buff_lady_deathstrike/', 'selftext': '[Link to official post here](https://forums.playcontestofchampions.com/en/discussion/350108/balance-update-dani-moonstar-and-lady-deathstrike).      \\n\\n\\nHey all,\\n\\nBalance Team here again with an update on the latest round of Champions up for review, Dani Moonstar and Lady Deathstrike.    \\n\\n**Dani Moonstar**      \\nDani Moonstar was designed to be primarily Attacker focused, with some minor defensive threats to play around. Her combo of Marked and Slow passives, as well as the brand new Neuroshock DOT was targeted at annoying Skill defenders as well as characters who utilize “cheat death” mechanics. In her general day to day matchups, we’re happy with what we’re seeing, as her Damage and overall win rate have landed in a healthy spot in comparison to other comparable Mutant attackers. However, her performance against a defending Nick Fury is showing to be lower than we targeted, especially in comparison to other popular counters in the Battlerealm. With this in mind, we are looking to upgrade her effectiveness in this matchup, with her Neuroshocks as an area of interest. More info to come!      \\n\\n**Lady Deathstrike**       \\nLady Deathstrike joined the contest as a mutant slayer with some sneaky defensive tendencies. While her utility is focused on mutants (heal block, unstoppable prevention, unblockable prevention, and face blocking specials), on attack she has become a really strong generalist with impressive win rates against champions of every class. That being said, there was initial concern about the way she scales off of armor and not base attack. We investigated her scaling at different future ranks and wanted to see if it fell in line with comparables in both damage and class, which it did! Her lower rarities are substantially stronger than her counterparts, which was intended as a fun part of her design (so keep bullying gauntlet Weapon X with the 3*).\\n\\nAll of that being said, we will be tuning down her synergy with Sentinel giving him extremely strong cowardice potency the same way that we tuned down Shocker’s synergy with Spider-man (Symbiote). Otherwise Lady Deathstrike will be staying as is!       \\n\\n**Shocker**   \\nWhile working on Shocker’s buff we uncovered a bug in which his damage was scaling improperly. Because of the scope of the fix we are sadly pushing back his rebalance to December where he will be accompanying Red Skull. Sandman will be releasing on schedule, so look forward to destroying those Sugar Pill defenders in the meantime!    \\n\\n**What’s Next**.   \\nChanges incoming! Dani Moonstar and Lady Deathstrike’s timeline will look like:      \\n41.3 (November) + 42.0 (December) Beta builds\\n42.1 (January): Full release with changes', 'comments': ['Disappointed in the delay of shocker, but at the same time, I’d rather they get it right than not', \"The description of the Dani buff is a bit weird and hopefully not comprehensive. I hope they aren't going to just change her sig ability so it stops Fury's second life. That's certainly a necessary, but far from sufficient, step toward making Dani the attacker she's intended to be. She needs more flexibility overall, including in the timing of her damage cycle (so one AI move the wrong way or a slight slip up doesn't tank the rotation) and focusing on damage with utility (i.e. not having to forgo all damage to use Slow). Guess we will see what they do.\", 'My only problem with Dani is how inconsistent her damage is without the like 5 or 6* gambit relic. You can get good crit rng and end a fight in like 40 seconds. Or you can get bad crits rng and have a fight take over 2 minutes. She needs more consistency more than anything else', 'I recently snagged Dani as the final featured champ that had eluded me. Took her to r4 and max sig’ed her. She seems fun to play from the bit I’ve tested her out, but I recently saw KT1’s video on the balance and he said most of the community feedback hasn’t been the best for Dani and she’s just not worth it to play without a few tweaks to her playstyle. And he said this as a r5 owner.\\n\\nBeing so new to the champ (just pulled her about a week ago), I don’t know a lot of the details of the flak she gets. Can some of her current faults be overlooked a bit with a 5 star Gambit relic? Cause that’s what I currently have attached to her. Took it off my 7 star Gambit and also put Dani in his place in my BG deck.', 'This might be the wrong thread for this\\n\\nBut what exactly is this \"Sugar Pill\" stuff?
