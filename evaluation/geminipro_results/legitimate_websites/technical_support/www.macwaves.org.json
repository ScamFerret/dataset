We were originally known as Desktop Connections - an Apple User group exclusive to Monmouth County. A few years later we joined with folks from Toms River and Brick and became MOPMUG (Monmouth/Ocean County Professional Mac User Group). Around 1998 we changed our name to MacWaves to better reflect the diversity of our group.
