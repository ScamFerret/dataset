They went out of fashion in 2000s but seems to be coming back up again.\\n\\nHow these work-\\n\\n1. You'll be asked to buy a travel package worth 5-10k which will offer a bunch of free hotel stays, transport, food etc across India. The deal will seem too good as the benefits will easily reach 10x more than what you are paying.\\n\\n2. They ask you to bring your wife because their modus operandi revolves around convincing the wife first by offering these dazzling jaw breaking deals. If you do get convinced and buy the package, they will give you a bunch of vouchers for hotel stays, dinners, transport etc. Never air fare or train tickets, mind that.\\n\\n3. When it comes to using them - a few will work but for most of them, you'll be given a clause during booking the amenities - like to get that two night hotel stay free, you need to book 5 nights minimum. Or the free cab fare only covers drivers' fee, you'll still have to pay for fuel at their pre decided rates etc. In some cases, they will deny the voucher saying there's a cap and all slots are booked, try for another time.\\n\\n4. The way these are designed, they will ensure that you'll have to pay at least 80-90% of the planned travel cost through their operators, and 10% discount will be given by them. Of course they will overcharge you so you'll end up paying more.\\n\\n5. If you want to complain, their helpdesk will block you.  In most cases, right after a successful scam they will shut shop and run. That's why they call you to a hotel and not to their offices (they don't have any office, all details are fake).\\n\\n6. At the end of the scam, there's two outcomes - either you pay the high cost of their operators and book travel through them, or you're left with a bunch of useless paper vouchers.\\n\\n\\nSource - my parents were invited to one of these back in the 90s. Fortunately for us, one of our relatives had already lost money through such a scam and they informed us when this topic came up. Dodged a bullet. My mom still cribs about missing a great deal though.\"]}]"
