He struggles to pay his rent and is often mocked by the Police Department, led by Lieutenant Lois Einhorn. When the dolphin mascot of Miami's NFL team is abducted, Ventura takes the case. Soon Miami Dolphins players are kidnapped too, including Dan Marino, making Ace's work even more pressing. Eventually, the culprit is exposed as Ray Finkle aka Lieutenant Lois Einhorn a corrupt Lieutenant in the Miami-Dade Police Station, formerly the kicker for the Miami Dolphins. He took the identity of a missing hiker and lieutenant Lois Einhorn, getting a sex change to impersonate her vowing revenge on Dan Marino. During the second film, Ace attempts monasticism after a failed rescue attempt of a raccoon, only to be called out of retirement to investigate a missing sacred bat. During meditation with the Abbot, he discovers Vincent Cadby who originally hired him to find the bat is the same kidnapper who wanted the war to happen so he can take control of the guano deposits there. He thwarts Cadby's plans and returns the sacred bat. After the marriage between the Wachati chief's daughter and Tiny Warrior, Ace is hunted down by both tribes, as he had sex with her, and took her virginity.\\n\\n***\\n\\n#Strength \\n\\n* [Hurts a
