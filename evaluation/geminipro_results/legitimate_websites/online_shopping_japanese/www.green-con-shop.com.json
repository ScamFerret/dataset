Here are some answers to the most common ones.**\\n\\n**When is THE CON?**\\n  \\nThe convention is July 18-21. It is more than likely most, if not all of the exclusives will be available in stores on that Friday, July 19. This comes from several blog entries that state \"retailers can start selling their shared convention exclusives on day 2 of the show. No sales are permitted prior to that.\" Which follows in line with ECCC and NYCC last year.\\n\\n\\n**What does shared mean?**\\n  \\nThe exclusives that are shared are items that can be found in stores outside of the convention. Places like Gamestop, Hot Topic, Amazon, Target etc. will all have their pops available either online, in store or both.\\n\\n**I\\'m new to collecting, what is happening? Why is everyone angry and the sub on fire?**\\n  \\nA handful of times a year Funko produces a number of exclusive items that are one time only and will never be seen again. It\\'s often a mad scramble to get what you need before they\\'re all gone and to get them you have to pay inflated flipper prices. My suggestion is if you don\\'t find something in-store right away, wait a few weeks for the price to stabilize, or come down to a non-astronomical amount and then make your second hand purchase if you must.\\n\\n**I have to work/babysit/go to school/sleep/make a baby. Can I make a post and ask for someone to help me out and get something since I\\'m busy?**\\n\\nNo. That is called backpacking and we do not allow backpacking requests on /r/funkopop. You may B/S/T with someone on /r/funkoswap after the fact but you may not make the request ahead of time. Please read the full rules for a full explanation if you still don\\'t understand.\\n\\n**How do I get notified of things going live?**\\nFor this /u/regexr has you taken care of. Go [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/RegExr/comments/90ygcm/funko_alerting_service_twitter_notifications/) to find out how to sign up for twitter notifications which go live instantly. Items are usually up on the sub within minutes but sometimes that can be too late.\\n\\n**I have more questions!!!!**\\n\\nThen please seek out the weekly QandA thread by using the search bar or commenting down below to have any additional questions answered.', 'comments': ['Hello it\\'s me again with my store sale times spreadsheet!\\n\\nIf any stores announce release dates/times I\\'ll update the last column with the confirmed info\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n|**Store**|**SDCC 18**|**NYCC 18**|**ECCC 19**|**SDCC 19 Guess**|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|**Amazon**|Random preorders week(s) before; live 12pm EDT on SDCC|two went live 12 days before at 8:20 PM EDT; all went live night before Con day at 8:20PM  EDT|One went live Sunday before, then all went live night before Con at 9:15PM EST|***WENT LIVE 7/18 6:20AM PDT / 9:20AM EDT; NO PRIOR ANNOUNCEMENT.

Here are some answers to the most common ones.**\\n\\n**When is THE CON?**\\n  \\nThe convention is July 18-21. It is more than likely most, if not all of the exclusives will be available in stores on that Friday, July 19. This comes from several blog entries that state \"retailers can start selling their shared convention exclusives on day 2 of the show. No sales are permitted prior to that.\" Which follows in line with ECCC and NYCC last year.\\n\\n\\n**What does shared mean?**\\n  \\nThe exclusives that are shared are items that can be found in stores outside of the convention. Places like Gamestop, Hot Topic, Amazon, Target etc. will all have their pops available either online, in store or both.\\n\\n**I\\'m new to collecting, what is happening? Why is everyone angry and the sub on fire?**\\n  \\nA handful of times a year Funko produces a number of exclusive items that are one time only and will never be seen again. It\\'s often a mad scramble to get what you need before they\\'re all gone and to get them you have to pay inflated flipper prices. My suggestion is if you don\\'t find something in-store right away, wait a few weeks for the price to stabilize, or come down to a non-astronomical amount and then make your second hand purchase if you must.\\n\\n**I have to work/babysit/go to school/sleep/make a baby. Can I make a post and ask for someone to help me out and get something since I\\'m busy?**\\n\\nNo. That is called backpacking and we do not allow backpacking requests on /r/funkopop. You may B/S/T with someone on /r/funkoswap after the fact but you may not make the request ahead of time. Please read the full rules for a full explanation if you still don\\'t understand.\\n\\n**How do I get notified of things going live?**\\nFor this /u/regexr has you taken care of. Go [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/RegExr/comments/90ygcm/funko_alerting_service_twitter_notifications/) to find out how to sign up for twitter notifications which go live instantly. Items are usually up on the sub within minutes but sometimes that can be too late.\\n\\n**I have more questions!!!!**\\n\\nThen please seek out the weekly QandA thread by using the search bar or commenting down below to have any additional questions answered.', 'comments': ['Hello it\\'s me again with my store sale times spreadsheet!\\n\\nIf any stores announce release dates/times I\\'ll update the last column with the confirmed info\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n|**Store**|**SDCC 18**|**NYCC 18**|**ECCC 19**|**SDCC 19 Guess**|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|**Amazon**|Random preorders week(s) before; live 12pm EDT on SDCC|two went live 12 days before at 8:20 PM EDT; all went live night before Con day at 8:20PM  EDT|One went live Sunday before, then all went live night before Con at 9:15PM EST|***WENT LIVE 7/18 6:20AM PDT / 9:20AM EDT; NO PRIOR ANNOUNCEMENT.
