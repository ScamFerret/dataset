I removed Hertz Mille Pro 165.3 components being powered by a Hertz HCP 4D 400w amp run off of an Alpine W650 Headunit, but keeping the Mille Pro 690.3 coax in the rear package tray.  I wasn’t unhappy with the sound, but the kick panels were awful.\\n\\nCurrently, I have a Sony XAV-AX6000 ready to go in, the 690.3 in the rear package tray, and 2 new sets of Mille Pro 6.5 coax going in the doors for a total (the new door panel pods match front and rear, hence the 4 6.5’s). \\n\\nMy question is…what would you guys run for amps and subs? I am up in the air between 2 JL Audio W3’s or a single W6, and would like the amps to be either one large amp that handles everything or aesthetically matching amps since this is almost as much for me about appearance as it is sound.  Open to other recommendations as well to round this out.', 'comments': [\"Single w6 can't miss, and the simple fascia will gell with the antique vibe.

Its big, unwieldy, and impractical. But still such a rare and precious thing i cant help but think someone would love to have it.\\n\\nApart from that i have several more turntables of various vintages from the 50s up to the 00s that all have something wrong with them. I’m hoping someone around here just loves collecting and refurbishing antique audio. *fingers crossed*\\n\\nThe victrola i’d like to sell but to be honest i’m not a very shrewd entrepreneur and i’m prone to accepting almost any offer if I think the buyer is genuinely going to appreciate it. The other record players i’ll let go for some home grown produce, canned goods, butter, or anything else that might be valuable (or money)', 'comments': ['The California Historical Radio Society on Central Ave. might be interested in them.
