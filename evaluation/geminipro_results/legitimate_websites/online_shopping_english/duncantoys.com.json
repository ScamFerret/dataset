            "reason": "//duncantoys.com/ meets multiple criteria of a scam website. The website claims to offer on orders over $50 which is. The website also claims to be the world's #1 Yo-Yos and Toys which is a claim that is generally not possible to verify. Additionally the website uses texts that target human weaknesses such as the use of the words \\The Original\\ and \\World's #1\\. Furthermore the website does not provide any information about the company such as its address or phone number. The website also handles different products from common e-commerce websites such as yo-yos toys and outdoor toys. The inquiry phone number and email address are not appropriate for business use. The privacy of customer information notation is ambiguous. The payment methods are not common and are unusual. Finally the information listed on the website has not been updated."
