A garden, a favorite room, a beautiful vista, a human portrait, the bridal party... Testimonials Dear Ms. Schulz, Thank you so much for the beautiful watercolor that you did of my brother John's new house! You really captured the charm of their 1920s colonial. I have to say that I was somewhat anxious arranging for something like this over the Internet (even after seeing your online portfolio), but I couldn’t have been more pleased. We presented the painting to John and his new wife Kelly as a wedding gift in mid-August--they loved it! They immediately hung it over the fireplace in their living room. I think it is a gift that they will always treasure.\" K.H., Asburn, VA Dear Janet, I just wanted you to know that I gave our parents the watercolors at the rehersal dinner last Friday. My mother cried. My mother-in-law has hers up already. They were a huge hit!\" To Janet Schulz, Just want you know that we received today a beautiful watercolor of our \"old homestead\" in Barrington from our Realtor. What a wonderful talent you have and to think you are expressing it in such a way that brings so much joy to others. This is what the Lord meant in \"doing unto others\". We certainly appreciate your talent and want to thank you for the lovely picture which shall hang on the wall and grace our living room as long as time allows. Janet, Thank you so much for providing such a wonderful service and for helping me to give such heartfelt gifts to my family. You are truly talented. I received the house portrait that you painted and could not be more pleased. I feel so fortunate to order custom art from someone so talented. You really captured everything about the house that I was hoping you would. Thank you so much! Thank you for doing such a terrific job on my house. I just love the shadows you projected and how you captured the color variations. I look forward to using you again. I’ve just received the house portrait you did for me and I am BLOWN AWAY.  The minute I opened the box I ran around the office showing it to my colleagues.  I can’t wait to frame it and give it to my clients this weekend.  Thank you so much for the beautiful work and I look forward to ordering from you in the future. Hi Janet, Our Realtor gifted us a beautiful painting of our new house we just bought with her help. We love it so much (the house and the painting)! In fact, I love it so much that I’d like to get others done. The first one is a painting of the house I grew up in, for my mom. She lived there for 35 years until she sold it to move closer to me and my family. She’s very sentimental about it. Her birthday is coming up, and this would be a perfect present for her. References are always available. contact janet@janetschulzartists.com Commission a beautiful custom watercolor by the artist, Janet Schulz, the perfect personal gift for someone in your family, a friend, a client, or just yourself. Each painting is a signed original from your photograph, and ready for framing. A gift of art will never be re-gifted, but will be treasured and passed on for generations. Get in touch MENU x Thank you for the beautiful watercolor of my boat. You did a perfect job of capturing her under sail and looking great--something very difficult with a camera and almost impossible with a brush. I have hung it in my office and look at it often. Even if I can't get out sailing on her, it is delightful to daydream."
