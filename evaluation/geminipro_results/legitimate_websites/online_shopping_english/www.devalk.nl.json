That's 34k per person + maintenance/fuel/port/internet\\nAssuming total 45k per person as entry cost with 1 year of life on a boat with multiple destinations visited and option to sell your share after the year, does this sound like a good option for those who run a remote business but want a higher standard of living?\", 'comments': [\"You don't want a boat that large - it's a money pit.\\n\\nThere used to be a Jongert about this size listed on Bethon - it was asking about €850,000 and listed €2,000,0000 or €3,000,000 spent in maintenance in two major refits in the last 15 years.\\n\\nEDIT: maintenance of that boat will also be particularly expensive if the hull is, as stated in the listing, of wooden construction. That would explain why the asking price appears so cheap (although maintenance costs of all boats rises exponentially with length (well, actually displacement, I think) and prices start dropping over 45' for this reason.\\n\\nI dread to think what the fuel costs will be on a boat that size, but you will never find 9 people who are all able to commit €35,0000 and all want to do the same thing as you.\\n\\nFor one or two people you want to look at the 30' - 40' range (9m - 12m).\", '34k... that is probably what I spend every 4 years on rent, not economical really. Plus I personally have never met a DN with money like that to spare', 'I would kill myself if I had to spend an entire year on a boat with 9 strangers', 'I’d love to do something like this, I’m actually taking my competent crew course this year - splitting the costs seems like a great idea.', \"How much experience do you have of boating...?\\n\\nIt's impractical. A boat is a money pit and that's before you even try and go anywhere. Motor yachts drink fuel. And fuel costs even more money. They are also not suited to heavy seas. The locations you can motor to have to be very close. You also need to work out mooring fees as you go.\\n\\nIn addition to people paying to be on the boat you will need a crew. You can't expect people who don't know about boats to crew them. The sea is very dangerous. It will kill anyone who doesn't respect it.\\n\\nIf you want to buy a motor yacht become a millionaire first and then buy it. You will enjoy it more.\"]}]"
