Every component in our garments are from an American manufacturer. We are passionate and committed to the American worker, and American manufacturing. Many of our competitors are claiming \"U.S.A made\" when in fact they are using fabric from China or some other offshore country. Some are even claiming \"North American Made\", which means they are made in Mexico, Guatemala, or Canada, still with imported fabric, primarily from China. The sweatshirts that you get from us start with cotton grown in the United States, spun into yarn by a local spinner, knit in our own factory, dyed by an American dye-house, and finally cut and sewn into wearable clothing by well paid sewing machine operators in our own factory. Some have worked in the Kellsport mill for over 30 years. Our zippers, drawcords, elastic, labels, buttons, grommets, and sewing thread all come from domestic manufacturers that make the product in America. Not a single component that we use is imported. That's what we believe in, and we're proud of it. Made in U.S.A. Subscribe for Discounts and Special Offers. Enter your email address to subscribe Provide your email address to subscribe.
