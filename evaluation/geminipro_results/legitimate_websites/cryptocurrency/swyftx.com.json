Nothing at all to do with the all-account Binance withdrawal block that was also going on yesterday evening, total coincidence...\\n\\nFrustratingly they doubled down on their claim even after Binance re-enabled withdrawals. **On-chain data shows they had lent my ETH to Binance as soon as I deposited it with Swyftx - this seems to be why they suddenly needed to come up with a reason to prevent me withdrawing it and froze my entire account (which included blocking AUD withdrawals - essentially arbitrarily seizing my funds).**\\n\\nCue 12+hrs spent in chats with their support stalling me and lying repeatedly, claiming I haven\\'t verified my wallet or KYCd (both done previously to their highest level), claiming that they couldn\\'t find my email address in their system (amusingly that very chat message was automatically cross-sent to my email address by their system), etc\\n\\nSwyftx seem to likely be illiquid, are actively lending users\\' funds to Binance, and I have been unable to find any evidence that their exchange is anything more than an automated middleman bot running on Binance IOUs for the user funds they\\'ve lent.

The fine print of the Swyftx risk disclosure statement (which has now been updated *after* most users would have first registered) actually says:\\n\\n**\"Crypto assets in your Swyftx account are not held by Swyftx as a custodian or fiduciary, are not insured by any private or governmental insurance plan, and are not covered by any compensation scheme.\"**\\n\\nand then\\n\\n# \"Swyftx does not hold an Australian financial services licence or an Australian credit licence. \"\\n\\nIf you have any ETH on Swyftx, then take a look on Etherscan at what they\\'ve done with it since you deposited.
