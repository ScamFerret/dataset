You can reinterpret that and make it into a site that debunks Bitcoin myths. In addition, people googling to get free bitcoin will instead come away more informed about Bitcoin.', \"What are people going to do with 300 bits?  It's just making dust transactions which do nothing. It's like walking around Russia giving everyone a free penny and expecting people in Russia to get excited about the USD. \\n\\nTurn it into a testnet faucet for developers, and advertise on it. Maybe host developer forums too.\", \"Make it a resource for information or a gateway to the bitcoin world. Make the giveaway more of a enter to win a larger payout, 5-20$ worth. Like someone mentioned, faucets don't make much sense anymore, and the ad revenue model is busted. The 'bitcoin faucet' needs to be reimagined from the ground up.\", 'You can always lease it to OK Coin for $10,000 USD per month :D', 'Sell it to me for one zillion bitcoins']}]"
