The total amount to be mailed is over $140 million and will be completed by the first week of October.\\n\\n2. **Creditor Portal:**\\n   - A Creditor Portal has been launched as a primary source of information and communication.\\n   - Creditors can use this portal to view updates, access their individual claim and distribution information, access key bankruptcy documents, and connect to CoinLedger for transaction history and tax reports.\\n   - The portal also contains a Help Center for queries.\\n\\n3. **Data Breach and Security:**\\n   - There have been allegations of a potential data breach with Voyager creditors receiving phishing schemes.\\n   - All official communications will only be sent from the @INVESTVOYAGER.COM domain. Customers should be wary of any communications requesting account or wallet information.\\n   - Customers should not provide account or wallet information in response to any Voyager-related communications.\\n   - An investigation is ongoing, and measures are being taken to ensure data security.\\n\\n4. **Litigation and Recoveries:**\\n   - Mediation is ongoing with FTX Trading, Ltd. and its affiliates. While mediation is confidential, if unsuccessful, litigation will proceed.\\n   - The Wind-Down Debtor is involved in the 3AC insolvency proceedings in the British Virgin Islands with an undisputed claim of approximately $650 million.\\n   - Other litigation claims are being investigated, and recoveries from these will be distributed to creditors in the future.\\n\\n5. **Tax Implications:**\\n   - The Wind-Down Debtor will not be issuing 1099 tax forms to creditors. They are encouraged to seek their own tax advice regarding the bankruptcy implications.\\n\\n6. **Future Communications:**\\n   - Future distributions to creditors will be made by check only, and advance notice will be provided in a status report filed with the court.\\n\\nIt's crucial for customers to stay updated, be cautious of fraudulent communications, and seek professional advice where necessary.\", 'Yes, I came here to get feedback as well.

The goal of this post is to provide a straightforward guide which maximizes your chances of actually reaching a real Jagex moderator reading your message. \\n\\nI\\'ll be as straightforward as possible - **the support center is unintuitive and understaffed**. There are many posts in this subreddit about users unable to find how to message the support team. Even if you do manage to reach them, you can never be fully sure if/when they might get back to you. \\n\\nSome of the popular community sentiments from Reddit have included: \\n\\n*[\"Jagex\\'s customer service has ranged from \"Really Bad\" to \"Nonexistent\"\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/b49sfb/talk_is_cheap_jagex_show_us_results_customer/)*\\n\\n*[\"It\\'s sad that players have to resort to front-page reddit attention for genuine issues which should be solved via the ticket system, but cannot currently be done so.

Does Jagex even have a support team?\\n\\nYou might not expect the answer... but yes. \\n\\nA [post from 2017 by Mod Kelvin](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/6a4j1o/how_do_i_actually_contact_support_for_osrs/dhdczcq/) mentions that \"**We\\'re a small team of 32** (which also encompasses anti-cheating, community safety, out of hours bug reports and system monitoring, as well as customer support)\". \\n\\nAlthough I do not have a more recent figure, I expect the number to have grown by now at least by some amount.\\n\\n#2. How does the support backend operate?\\n\\nJagex uses a support desk software called Zendesk. I\\'ve used it in professional capacity myself before, and it\\'s an insanely good software. \\n\\nFor those particularly curious, you can check Zendesk functionality in this 2-min product video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2tu2G5MYH4\\n\\nThe software helps assign all tickets to their relevant category, and to make it as simple as possible for the support agent to resolve it. (including features like pre-written macros and filtering) \\n\\nAlthough it\\'s not possible to know for certain, I imagine the main categories of ticket types would include the following:\\n\\n- Account recovery and login issues\\n- Billing and membership\\n- Ban appeals\\n- Technical support\\n\\nIngame abuse reports might work with a different system and not be included in Zendesk.\\n\\n#3. How do I reach the support team?\\n\\n**If it\\'s urgent, you\\'re probably out of luck.** Desperately try posting on Reddit and Twitter and hope your issue picks up traction.\\n\\nIf it\\'s not urgent, find the best place to **make your support ticket and patiently wait**. By using the optimal form you make it easier for the support agents to address your issue, so it is very highly recommended to do so. \\n\\nHowever, the **Support Center is designed to reduce the amount of tickets as much as possible** and instead leads you to a Q&A page whenever possible. For that reason, I\\'ll share as many of the links as possible that actually allow you to create a **real** ticket.\\n\\n**Here\\'s the full list of links that I\\'ve prepared:**\\n\\n- ***Account recovery and login issues***\\n\\n[Hijacked account - Response ETA: Up to 24 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207217595-Hijacked-account)\\n\\n[Changing your registered email - Response ETA: Up to 24 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207555905-Changing-your-registered-email)\\n\\n[My account is locked - Response ETA: Up to 24 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/206103939-My-account-is-locked)\\n\\n[Denied Password Resets - Response ETA: Up to 24 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/206666629-Denied-password-resets)\\n\\n- ***Billing and membership***\\n\\n[Request a Refund - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000982997-Request-a-Refund)\\n\\n[Transfer Bonds - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000937037-Transfer-Bonds)\\n\\n[Settle an Unpaid Balance - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207256855-Settle-an-Unpaid-Balance)\\n\\n[Find my Bonds - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207126289-Find-my-Bonds)\\n\\n[Common Credit Card Issues - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/206793599-Common-Credit-Card-Issues)\\n\\n[Common Prepaid Card Issues - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours  ](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207480615-Common-Prepaid-Card-Issues)\\n\\n[Unrecognised Payment - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/206827535-Unknown-transaction-)\\n\\n[Recurring subscription rebill failed - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours  ](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/206377679-Recurring-subscription-rebill-failed)\\n\\n- ***Ingame***\\n\\n[Ironman Removal - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000868277-Ironman-Removal)\\n\\n[Lost RS3 items - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/209366569-Lost-Items)\\n\\n- ***Ban appeals***\\n\\n[Account Bans - Response ETA: Up to 14 days](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115002238729-Account-Bans)\\n\\n[Account Mutes - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115002329065-Account-Mutes)\\n\\n- ***Technical support***\\n\\n[Common Connection Issues - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207344375-Common-Connection-Solutions-)\\n\\n[Website Issues - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000988977-Website-help)\\n\\n[Game Crashes - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360006627238-Game-crashes)\\n\\n[Client issues - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360004572897-Client-issues)\\n\\n[Improving performance - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207344395-Improving-performance)\\n\\n[Graphical Problems - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207482995-Graphical-Problems)\\n\\n[Audio help - Response ETA: Up to 48 hours] (https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000996998-Audio-help)\\n\\nBy submitting the ticket in the correct section, it goes in the queue of the the Jagex support employees working specifically on that type of tickets. \\n\\n#4. I submitted a ticket. What happens now?\\n\\nAll submitted tickets are assigned to a category depending on which support center page they were submitted from. If a ticket was sent to the wrong place, agents will move it to end up at the correct place. \\n\\nOnce submitted, most tickets are handled on a first-come-first-serve basis. However, agents also have the option to put more complex tickets \"on hold\", if they need a longer amount of time to look into the issue. (for example, getting a senior specialist to help review the matter)\\n\\nIf you\\'re certain you\\'ve provided all of the required information, you can simply patiently wait until they\\'re able to respond to your ticket. If you forgot to specify any important detail, you can still add it to the ticket by responding to the automated support ticket email.\\n\\n#5. I never received a reply!\\n\\nIf it has been a really long time, e.g. 30+ days, you can consider submitting a new ticket. The same goes if the Jagex Mod replying to your ticket misunderstood your question and didn\\'t provide a satisfactory answer. \\n\\nUsually this shouldn\\'t happen, but support desk employees go through large volumes of tickets each day and it\\'s possible they can make a mistake.\\n\\nIt\\'s best to be understanding. You can also ping @JagexSupport on Twitter with your ticket number, and a different support team employee might take a look at it.\\n\\n#6. Can I reach Jagex Support on Twitter?\\n\\nShort answer - yes. However, for dealing with any sensitive account matters, it will still have to be handled in a ticket. \\n\\nTweeting @JagexSupport actually creates a Zendesk ticket for them, so it can be a viable channel to reach a Jagex employee. However, they will typically only provide you publicly available information and links to where you can submit a ticket. Sort of similar to what I\\'ve done in this post.\\n\\n#7. Great! I understand the system. I\\'m still dissatisfied and would like it to be better.\\n\\nAs would I.\\n\\nHowever - if more players start submitting support tickets, it creates a pressure on Jagex to expand their support team. \\n\\nIf your ticket takes a significantly long time to be resolved, it means that Jagex has insufficient capacity in that particular division. But while this might not feel ideal, it\\'s also a metric than be very clearly seen in the Zendesk administrative side. (amount of actively unsolved tickets & average time for ticket solve) The Jagex Support team leads would then be able to use that information to (hopefully) convince upper management to add more support staff members.\\n\\nSimply put - if the users make support tickets, they are pressured to hire enough staff to resolve them. \\n\\n\\n-------\\n\\n*So, Jess - why did you write a 10000 char essay about Runescape support?*\\n\\nI uh... I\\'m a support main!? But honestly, more than any money making guide or skilling guide - I think a customer support guide actually has enormous value for the community. I feel someone had to do it, and as I\\'ve also had customer support experience myself (using Zendesk as well) I have a pretty good idea of how they might operate. \\n\\nI hope you found this guide on the inner workings of Runescape/OSRS support system insightful. If there\\'s any part I forgot to mention, feel free to let me know and I\\'d be glad to adjust it. \\n\\n**tl;dr - If it\\'s urgent, make a ticket & post on Reddit/Twitter to desperately get someone to escalate it asap. If it\\'s not urgent, make a ticket and patiently wait for an answer. Links & info are in guide to make it easy for you.**\\n\\nThank you for reading, and I hope you found it insightful. :)', 'comments': ['[deleted]', \"This needs to be pinned. \\n\\nAnd also made public in some form on the osrs website for new players. (Without the small talk)\\n\\nIt's easy to understand.\", 'Damn yesterday I actually accidentally bought a couple rs3 bonds and i would like them transferred...', 'Very well written and informative.\\n\\nThough I do have a faster and more effective system idea in place that is only 3 easy steps!\\n\\n1) Move to cambridge (if you live there skip this step)\\n2) Get hired at Jagex\\n\\n 3) Fix the problem yourself', 'Hello! Thanks for the post - and you\\'ve really encapsulated my recent experience with Jagex Support. My main account (RSN \\'Dkm1966\\') was recently banned On Sunday, 22 Nov, for macro major in real-time, while I was online, playing it, spamming left-click + Esc to force shop restocks in the magic guild and tzhaar area shops for a friend (he was buying and selling runes to get an onyx).\\n\\nThe ban review form straightjackets you into one of five responses in the drop-down, and since I wasn\\'t 100% sure whether I had broken any rules, I chose the apologetic \"I\\'m sorry\" option and sent it in. I got an auto-response upholding the perm ban within 10 minutes. Since then I have been unable to contact any J-Mod for a human review, despite making a Reddit account and a Twitter account to do so as politely as I could. I\\'ve been trying to get mods Trident and Tyran (the anti-cheat specialists) to look into it with 0 success. \\n\\nI first [tried to post a thread on Reddit](https://imgur.com/a/t81jdws), but it failed to get mod approval and never got past the filter.\\n\\n[Here\\'s an imgur album which more fully explains my story](https://imgur.com/a/ei8jSbW).\\n\\nI then made a Twitter account and [tried to @ the two most relevant J-Mods](https://imgur.com/a/46RQmno) I could find. No response.\\n\\n[Here is a direct link to the Twitter post, it\\'s still up and pretty fresh!](https://twitter.com/Dkm19661/status/1330854055732682753)\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve also tried to PM /u/jagextyran on Reddit, similarly with no response. All of this has made me feel pretty hopeless, especially since he took the time to participate in that whole vorkath bot meme kerfluffle, but has not so much as said \\'fuck you\\', \\'fuck off\\', or even acknowledged any of my attempts at contact.\\n\\nDo I have any other options? I\\'m moving on and won\\'t be returning to the game whether or not I get the account back at this point, but it\\'s become a principle thing for me now and I\\'m just wondering if I have any further things i can do.\\n\\nThank you!\\n-Dkm1966.']}]"
