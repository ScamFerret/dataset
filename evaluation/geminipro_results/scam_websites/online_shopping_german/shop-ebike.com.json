This is very likely not a coincidence, and it is also very likely not companies cloning each other.\\n\\nMost popular brands, especially brands based in the USA, get their ebikes from Chinese manufacturers. \"Duh\" I hear you say. Nowadays, every company in every industry is probably manufacturing something in China.\\n\\nWell, this is actually different. Let me explain:\\n\\nLet us take a laptop startup company as an example. Some of you might be familiar with Framework, the startup company that makes modular laptops. Linus, from Linus Tech Tips, who happens to be an investor in this company, recently made a video on his Framework factory tour ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nXVJBGowmY&ab\\\\_channel=LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nXVJBGowmY&ab_channel=LinusTechTips)).\\n\\nSuch companies work with manufacturing partners to build their products. These companies, however, design the product, the prototypes, the manufacturing lines, and the manufacturing tools. The manufacturer will follow their guidelines, use their tools, and build their designs.\\n\\nOn the other hand, we have the \\\\*ebike\\\\* companies, which we will call in this post \"dropshippers\". These companies do not really work with manufacturing partners, but they just directly buy from them the final product as is. They can add slight modifications, such as choosing which brakes to use on these bikes from the ones that the manufacturer offers to use, or which tires. If they manage to get a contract with the manufacturer, they can take it to the next level and maybe add additional customizations, like their very own lineup of tires, or their own type of handlebars or whatever.\\n\\nThese companies, at their heart, have little to no actual knowledge in designing ebikes. They are specialists in mainly: (online) marketing, customer service (if you\\'re lucky), locality of the warehouses (again, if you\\'re lucky), and web design. Their business model is almost exclusively direct-to-consumer. This is not a coincidence, because most local bike shops do not want to get involved in such bikes, due to their not-so-standard, low quality parts, and to how frequent they break and need maintenance.  These bikes sell almost always for under $2000. Can you imagine the profit margin off these bikes? There is little to no engineering involved. They just buy the ebike from the manufacturer at maybe $300, and sell it for $1500 to $2000. These numbers are based on some of the companies that I managed to find their products at alibaba for that alibaba retail price (so, you can imagine that they get it for even cheaper, given that these prices are actual retail prices to consumers, not contractual companies).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOf course, not all ebike companies are \"dropshippers\". There are a lot of them who have actual experience in designing, building and manufacturing (electric) bikes. Companies like Trek, Specialized, Gazelle, Canyon and many more, are actual bike specialists. They know how to build bikes, and they have been doing that for a long time. In this post, I refer to those companies as \"ebike companies\", while I refer to the other companies as \"dropshippers\".Why does all of this matter? There are several reasons:\\n\\n* Build quality: You can expect the build quality of the bike, and the components that are used to build the bike, to be significantly better when you get a bike from an ebike company comparing to one you get from dropshippers.\\n* Longevity: Ebikes that are built by actual ebike companies last for a really long time. Just take a look at websites where used bikes are sold. I guarantee you will find ebikes from actual ebike companies that are 7 to 8 years old and still function properly without any issues.\\n* Customer service: This one is obvious, right? Most ebike companies have real customer service. They know their products. They designed them. The companies that designed the parts used in their products also have an excellent customer service. They also have a network of local bike shops that can fix and maintain the bikes.\\n* Safety: Ebike companies invest more in quality controls and certifications. You will find a lot of them having UL certification for their batteries and chargers for instance, while dropshippers \"hope to be getting the certification in the near future\" (I do not think they can get it, unless the manufacturer they buy the bikes from decides to get the certification).\\n\\nThere are many other reasons, but you get the point. Ebikes you buy from direct-to-consumer dropshippers are cheaper, but you get a whole lot less in the long run.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis is my 2 cents on where the ebike industry stands at this point.', 'comments': ['Popular Opinion.', \"Most shitty bikes are, but there are quality direct-to-consumer bikes, like ride1up, that actually design the bike itself, afaik.  I don't know where RAD, Aventon, Super73 fall.\\n  \\nThere's a LOT of potentially dangerous crap being peddled (pedaled? lol) in this industry, but there's nuance to the discussion.\", '>Unpopular Opinion: Most popular ebike companies are structured dropshippers\\n\\nHow is this an unpopular opinion when everyone agrees with this statement?', \"I'm not sure this is all that much of a revelation. I will say though having only two categories is a bit limiting. I called a number of the companies that you would refer to as dropship companies when I was making my buying decision. There was quite a range of knowledgeability and customer service skill among them.\\n\\nSimilarly, on the other side of the spectrum, just because a company is good at building analog bicycles does not mean they will be good at building electric bicycles. \\n\\nFinally, I would warn you that the video you watched should be characterized as an advertisement. Linus is admittedly marketing a company in which he has a stake. Therefore he has a vested interest in making it look better than other companies.\", \"Honestly the whole thing seems like it is a bit of a shit show. I have been looking into a new e-bike for a bit now, and eventually it came down to Yamaha or DIY. I didn't want to spend $3K for a bike only for it to have 500wh capacity, so DIY was the only path for me.  \\n\\n\\nI do think people are a bit unfair when it comes to pricing. I ended up going for an EM3EV triangle battery, 52v 20ah with Panasonic cells and it was over $600. I looked quite a bit at other companies and if you don't want mystery cells, and you want a fully fused battery pack you are just going to have to spend the money. I see lots of people complaining about price, but it seems really hard to use quality components and have a decent bike for less than about $1.5K. The Tongsheng TSDZ2B 100mm BB 52v 750w mid drive after shipping from China costs like $500, I know people on this sub really want sub $1K bikes, but it just seems like a company would have to cut some major corners to make that happen and still make a profit.\"]}, {'title': 'What car companies branch further than just cars?', 'subreddit': 'cars', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/195t0i7/what_car_companies_branch_further_than_just_cars/', 'selftext': \"I was thinking about it this morning, and realized:  You could get up, go out of your house, and hop on your Porsche [bicycle](https://shop.porsche.com/us/en-US/p/porsche-ebike-cross-2022-WAP065EBS0P00X-B/WAP065EBS0P00L).

Karma, why not starting a little riot.\\n\\nHere it goes:\\n\\nA study based on data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)  found that petrol and diesel vehicles experience 1,530 fires (one thousand and five hundred thirty) per 100,000 vehicles in the US.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIn contrast, 1 in 10,000-15,000 ebikes catch fire so that\\'s 7-10 (seven to ten) fires per 100,000 ebikes.....let that sink in.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nPlus, 40% of ebike fires were diy ebikes. Moreover, the majority of ebike fires occured in places like London and NYC in the peak year of ebike fires in 2022. According to various statements from the chiefs of the NYC and London fire departments these fires mainly affected ebikes from delivery drivers and specifically a brand of silverfish batteries popular among delivery drivers. Most of the fires were caused by improper handling and tampering with the batteries (diy upgrades etc), and use of incorrect chargers.\\n\\nThe other thing I noticed is that the good entry level brands like Aventon often get recommended in lieu of the \"cheap Chinese ebikes\". Interestingly, when looking at some of their models, the motors and batteries are the very same motors and batteries (for instance Reention Dorado) that can be found in my cheap Chinese Aliexpress, Walmart, and Amazon ebikes.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nCan someone please explain to me how Aventon ebikes are safe ebikes and get recommended a lot on here as entry level ebikes, while my cheap Chinese ebikes with the very same battery and components will immediatedly explode the minute I buy them, and my house will burn down to the ground the minute I role them in my garage?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nObviously there is a risk of battery fires, especially if handled improperly, no doubt. Just like EV car fires are way less abundant than the media and hence public opinion makes them out to be, it seems the same happens with the cheap Chinese ebikes and blind battery fear mongering.\\n\\nThoughts?\\n\\n**Edit: Monday morning debrief:** Well, that went way better than I initially anticipated. Lots of good input without refraining to the usual name calling on here (except that one guy ;-)\\n\\nUnfortunately, there is not too much statistical data available yet, but I am guessing there will be soon. Meanwhile, everyone can do a rough estimate, if so inclined:\\n\\nTotal number of ebikes in the US since 2018: roughly 4 million\\n\\n[https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1321-december-18-2023-e-bike-sales-united-states-exceeded-one-million](https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1321-december-18-2023-e-bike-sales-united-states-exceeded-one-million)\\n\\nTotal numbers of fires in the US in the first half of 2023 roughly 200, so let\\'s say 400 in 2023 (probably a bit underreported in rural settings) with the majority reported in major cities, especially NYC (267 ebike fires).\\n\\n[https://apnews.com/article/ebike-fires-lithium-ion-batteries-b5ab9acf9ca317a1b5b917097ac5210d](https://apnews.com/article/ebike-fires-lithium-ion-batteries-b5ab9acf9ca317a1b5b917097ac5210d)\\n\\nIf my simple math (4000000 / 400 equals 1 in 10000) is not completely wrong, it is roughly an annual 1 in 10000 ebikes catching fire as mentioned above. Please feel free to compare with all sorts of other risks to set your house on fire, like electric heaters, electric blankets, microwaves, electric dryers etc etc\\n\\nIf you have newer, better numbers, feel free as well to share as it is an important discussion to be had. The recent 2024 NYC ebike fire in a **local e-bike shop** that killed 4 people, again attributed to improper charging/handling of batteries, shows that it is important to keep a close eye on these things.\\n\\nPlease follow **all** recommended safety measures when charging and handling your ebike battery. Pretty sure that these still unfortunately high numbers of fires can get lowered even more if some common sense is applied.\\n\\nMaybe it would also help if, instead of trying to scare ebike newbies with their fear mongering, the many ebike experts in this sub would spend a little more time educating newbies about safe Li-ion battery handling.', 'comments': ['Would you please post a link to the data showing 1 in 10k - 15k ebikes catch fire and that 40% of the ebike fires were diy ebikes?  That sort of data would be very helpful for people who are attempting to navigate their HOA, landlord, employer, whoever is trying to ban ebikes in the building.\\n\\nEdit - I also wouldn\\'t mind seeing the study from the NTSB about vehicle fires.  It\\'s interesting they\\'d use the phrase \"petrol\" for vehicles in the US.', 'The biggest difference between ebike fires and car fires is majority of car fires are outdoors when car is running while ebike fires are indoors when bike is stationary.\\n\\nCar catches fire you stop and watch your car burn down, ebike catches fire you run outside and watch your house burn down.', \"I work on the development side of ebikes, batteries included, and the Chinese stuff is a mixed bag.\\n\\n\\nIn my opinion, anything sold below the cost of the raw material is likely unsafe. And a lot of these bikes are. How is this possible? Dumping - manufacturing too many parts and selling them to clear space in warehouses.\\n\\n\\nThere are many Chinese manufacturers that are excellent, better than European often, so there is no general statement that is correct. But that is the problem, it is hard to differentiate without doing full tear downs, and even then you're at risk of counterfeit components.\\n\\n\\nMy 2c is that a battery fire in your house or apartment is likely serious (death, smoke exposure, loss of housing etc) due to the energetic nature, so reputable brands are essential. Your insurance company shares my opinion.\", \"Worrying about cheap Chinese batteries bursting into flames isn't FUD. Even quality lithium ions do it on occasion.  Just because the sticker on your battery has the same branding does not mean it's actually built to the same standards. Counterfeits are extremely common.\", 'You didn’t address even half of the real concerns about garbage ebikes. Fires are just one problem. The ecological costs of built-to-fail products are huge. Buying cheap products is more expensive in the long run due to maintenance and replacement costs. The labor exploitation necessary to hit that price point needs to be taken seriously. There isn’t corporate accountability for no-name one-off brands. I don’t want to live in a world awash in dangerous garbage.']}]"
