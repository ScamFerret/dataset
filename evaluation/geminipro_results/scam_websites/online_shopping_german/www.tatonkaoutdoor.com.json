It may be a bit harsh in the cutting but if it gets your mind working on seeing what may or may not be actually needed to balance both bag size/weight and *your* personal comfort level, then that's fine. Also, it may sound daunting to be continually doing sink/shower laundry, but when you travel long term you sort of get into a groove and it really just turns into part of your evening. But by all means, take everything with however much salt you prefer lol. It sounds like it's going to be an epic trip!\\n\\n> Bag: (can't decide) Tatonka Travelpack 35l or Tasmanian Tiger Mission Pack MKII 37l\\n\\nI always say load them up once your gear is finalized, and do a test walk. Even a loop of your block is enough to figure out quick if you're going to be comfortable for any length of time with what you're planning to carry day in day out.\\n\\n> Underwear: 5x Under Armour Boxers\\n\\n5 is lots, UA is quick dry synthetics no? You could lose a pair, pack 3 wear 1 and you can easily wash a pair when you shower. Having 1 or 2 spares helps if you get soaked or plan to wear them under shorts to swim in (if your swim shorts don't have a liner net, this keeps you contained).\\n\\n> Socks: 3x Adidas Sneaker Socks 1x Uniqlo Heattech Socks 2x Noname thin Socks 1x SealSkinz Waterproof Socks\\n\\nI would drop the nonames for sure. 3 socks (2 packed 1 worn) plus a nice thick spare for slipper use in the evenings or on cold days is okay, wash as you go. I don't know what the SealSkinz are intended for, swimming? I may catch flak for saying this but I hike in wet BC in non-waterproof trail running shoes, never waterproof, never boots, you just have to embrace the suck when your feet get wet. Sweating inside a waterproof sock sounds like blister city, and waterproof shoes only take about 30 minutes longer to completely wet out and hours more to dry. An alternative is those small thin plastic produce or bread bags you can wear inside your socks. By all means, if you want them, take them though, at the very least they might be nice for rocky beaches?\\n\\n> Pants: 2x 5.11 Chino (one wearing) 1x Nike Running Pants\\n\\nI would drop a chino, that will reduce a ton of bulk. If both chinos are different colours, that may be more beneficial/versatile to bring than the running pants, but I don't wear running pants and don't know how you intend to use them. Either way, decide to reduce 1 pant from this list and you will save probably 3 shirts worth of space.\\n\\n> Shorts: 1x Under Armour Running Shorts 1x Jordan Basketball Shorts 1x H&M Swimming Shorts\\n\\nRunning shorts and basketball shorts have a ton of overlap in my mind, I would pick one, probably the running shorts for athleisure/daily wear. Although if you drop the Nike pants above, the basketball shorts could be hostel wear for half the space (but so could the running shorts), food for thought here. Those H&M look similar to my favourite Patagonia Baggies, so I would agree with that selection.\\n\\n> Tops: 1x North Face 2 in 1 Rain Jacket (the fleece can't fit in the backpack) 1x Uniqlo Cotton Button Up 1x Outdoor Cotton Button Up 1x Random Cotton Pullover 1x Woolpower Merino Wool Pullover 3x Normal Shirt 1x Under Armour Sports Shirt 1x light linen button up 2x Tank Top 2x Uniqlo Heattech Longsleeve\\n\\nToo many tops. If the 2 in 1 is too bulky, don't pack it. Try to find 2 separate items that do the same task, as stand alone pieces are almost always less bulky and more usable, but I also think using what you have is fine if it all fits in the end. Remember, you won't always be wearing this on the plane if it's hot, so it needs to be able to fit. You have 3 button ups here, I would personally pack just 1, probably the linen since it will dry the quickest, dress up nice, cover well on the beach, and the packed wrinkled look is just part of it's charm. The cotton pullover, merino pullover and fleece from the 2in1 are all pulling the same duty. I would for sure cut the cotton one as it will dry incredibly slow and takes up the most room, if not also the merino one, and only use the fleece. I only bring a zip up grid fleece hoody, mine is from Outdoor Research, but there are several really good European brands like Ortovox, Mountain Equipment and Rab. 3 normal shirts is fine (I assume 1 is worn), the UA shirt is good for hiking/running, tank tops will be fine on the beach but are also something you could probably buy as souvenirs closer to beach time to save initial space. I would probably cut one longsleeve base layer, but that may depend on your hiking activities. If you could swap for a single merino long sleeve, it'll stink less after multiple wears, I can wear mine to construction work for 5 days without offending anyone around me, as long as I air it out in the evenings.\\n\\n> Other: 2x Microfiber Towels from Amazon 1x small Powerbank 1x Ultralight Umbrella 1x Small Camera from dm 1x Aluminium Bottle from Sigg\\n\\nI also usually travel with a second towel for laying on the beach, so I can't fault you for that one lol. It's gross to lay on your towel on a busy beach (cigarettes, spit, urine, dog turds, etc, etc, etc.) and then turn around and dry yourself off when clean out of a shower. Look at the Matador pocket blanket instead maybe, it's not as soft but packs down very small. The disposable camera is kind of retro and definitely fun to get printed, but a phone takes better pictures and isn't susceptible to the airport x-rays. You can ask for a hand check so they don't scan it, just keep this in mind.\\n\\n> Toiletries: 1x Old Spice Deo Stick 1x Charlemagne Pomade 1x Braun Electric Razor with charging cable 1x 90ml Showet Gel 1x Toothpaste 1x Philips Toothbrush 1x Nail Clipper 1x Anti Mosquito Spray 1x After Sun 1x Sun Screen\\n\\nOnly thing I'll say here is maybe try a bar of soap over the shower gel. It will last longer, and not count towards your liquids hit on the plane. I didn't used to think Dr. Bronner's solid soap was worth it, but I've really started to like it, I use it for body and hair. A single bar can get me pretty much exactly 2 full months of daily use, and can also be used for washing clothes. I also take an eye drop bottle (Visine or whatever, 10-15ml) of the concentrated liquid Dr. Bronner's soap to keep handy for bathrooms, pit toilets, hiking, whenever I need to wash my hands and the facilities are lacking. 3-4 drops can really clean your hands well, and last a long time, just the lack of sudsing takes a bit of getting used to. I don't specifically pack aftersun, I would rather plan on not getting burnt and then having to buy if I do, than to pack an extra liquid. Not having it also makes me a bit more vigilant in applying sunscreen (I like the face sticks personally). The pomade isn't something I use ever, so I'm ignorant here, but if you don't use this every day and haven't thought of this, maybe decant it into something smaller to shave some bulk. A manual toothbrush also saves a bit of space and need for charging/batteries, but a lot of people like this comfort so take what you need, I just never got on board with the electric kind. Alright, apparently I had more to say on toiletries than I thought.\\n\\nAgain, take from this what you want. Some good advice is already here and on other threads. I don't think buying a whole bunch of new kit is really ever worth it if you have items that already work for you, and some cotton t-shirts aren't going to ruin your trip if that's what you're comfortable wearing (but if you have some comfortable poly blends, they feel the same and dry a bit quicker!)\"]}, {'title': 'Alternatives for Trangia 25 kettle', 'subreddit': 'wildcampingintheuk', 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/wmni9k5lipqc1.jpeg', 'selftext': 'I’m not a fan of the Trangia kettles as I find aluminium imparts a metallic taste to my brew, is there any recommendations for an alternative, weight isn’t something I’m bothered about too much because this is my larger cook kit for when I wanna cook proper food and I’m not focusing on going as UL as possible.

The backpacks all have detachable shoulder straps that attach to the backpacks\\' bodies by (centrally) lashing through a webbing ladder sewn onto the pack\\'s back. See the Tasmanian Tiger / Tatonka V system for reference). My Austrian Bundesheer pack by Redo does it the same way so I guess it\\'s a common construction atleast in Europe.\\n\\nISSUE: i need my backpacks to get where I\\'m going and I\\'d love to be able to use a lighter rig once there. But I don\\'t want to carry a separate belt and suspenders. At the same time it\\'d be nice to attach a water bottle pouch and things like that to my backpack straps as a counter weight and for easy access. The kicker would be not to have to swap all the pouches around.\\n\\nSo, the obvious route seems to me to use the same shoulder straps and same hip belt I carry my pack with. That\\'s overkill for carrying some pouches ofc but, well... I\\'ve got them on me already so no harm no foul, right?\\n\\nBasically I am trying to create a modernized take on British PLCE with the parts I have at hand already.\\n\\nPROBLEM: I can\\'t for the life of me seem to be able to find a way to connect it all. There are all kinds of vests I could wear the backpack over, of course. There are chest rigs to be worn additionally to a belt set up. There are suspenders for separate belts. I even have an h-harness from a PLCE that works well with the belt but which is unnecessary extra and lacks PALS attachment on the shoulders.\\n\\nQUESTION: can anyone recommend a properly padded and ergonomic set of straps (fit for medium to heavy load rucking) compatible with that kind of backpack and a way to connect it in the back?\\n\\nI\\'m literally this close to get an old-school external metal frame just to connect the damn straps to the belt down in my spine ares. But there must be a better way. Right?... right?\\n\\nThanks everyone and please do feel free to ask if anything needs further clarification.
