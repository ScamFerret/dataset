We have proudly provided U.S homes with cute and healthy dwarf cows of love for years. As you browse through our website, you will be able to find and even buy a dwarf cow of your choice. More About This Breed Highland cattle live within a hierarchy system, where individuals are ranked, depending on age and sex. Older ones dominate younger ones and males dominate females. In addition, young males begin to dominate adult females, reaching the age of approximately 2 years. Calves, born from the top-ranking cow, automatically get higher positions in the herd, even without their mother’s initiative. Friendly behavior between the animals includes licking, mounting, and play-fighting. They are strong grazers, very skillful in foraging for food. During winter months, they dig through the snow layer with their horns to get to vegetation. In addition, when encountering a predator or a rival, they defend themselves, using their horns.
