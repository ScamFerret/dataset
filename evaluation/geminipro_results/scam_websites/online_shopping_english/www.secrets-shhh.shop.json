Issues with sleep and diabetes are very closely linked. \\n\\nRagen, I know you read this sub. Tell your doctor about your sleep problems and get your blood sugars checked.', \">Per coachâ€™s instructions I did hills on the first half and then worked to increase stride rate and speed on a flatter course for the second half. I tried a longer stride on the flat parts and that seemed to increase speed a bit.  I felt less shitty than last time.\\n\\nThis just in: longer or faster steps cover more ground.\\n\\n> These are getting long enough now that nutrition is becoming an issue, I have a really hard time eating or drinking anything but water when I walk/run.  I tried gel chews for this workout but they definitely did not settle well so weâ€™re going to try some other options.\\n\\nThat's a pretty elite long walk to require carb gels as nutrition. Why not a...banana?\", \"Two takeaways from this, she finally did some brick work but only because she took a 12 hour nap and she feels the need to eat during every stage of her training no matter the distance.  I regularly run 10-13 miles with no hydration or food.  I don't understand this need to constantly be eating while you are out on the road/course.\", \"If her reports are to be taken at face value, then she is in serious trouble. The reason she feels so crappy, sleeps for 12 plus hours, and doesn't have energy is over-training. She is describing a very real phenomenon perfectly. She is not physically capable of maintaining this level of, very moderate, training. Real ironman triathlon training is impossible for her. \\nWhich means she knows this and is setting up a face saving exit from this farce. I can't fathom any coach continuing to give workouts to someone reporting these kinds of reactions. Especially for someone who will be doing 17 hours of continuous activity. \\nShe may not be smart enough to understand sarcasm in a Slate article, but she has to know that she will never finish this race. My money is on a Will Not Start.\", \"Anyone else notice that after the thread that discussed \\n\\n1) she's not biking nearly enough as a percentage of her total workouts and \\n\\n2) she should be at a point where she's thinking about race nutrition\\n\\nAll of a sudden she's got 3 bike rides this week and mentions nutrition.  Coincidence?\"]}]"
