A thick lookup supplies all the necessary information on who registered the domain name, where and when it was registered, the expiry date, and the nameservers it uses.\\n For additional information, it's necessary to perform a further lookup, this time at the registrar on file, to get hold of complete information on the domain name ownership.\\n If you want to see who owns a website, but the domain owner uses a privacy protection service, a generic address may still be available, and you can try contacting the owner this way.\"}, {'url': 'https://www.whois.com/whois/', 'content': \"The Whois database contains details such as the registration date of the domain name, when it expires, ownership and contact information, nameserver information of the domain, the registrar via which the domain was purchased, etc.\\n Alternatively, if the domain name has already been registered, you can either register similar available domain names that we suggest, or use the contact information provided in order to get in touch with the owner and respectfully negotiate a sale. Similar to how a telephone number allows you to connect to a specific phone on the telecom network, similarly, an IP address allows your computer to connect to a specific server on the internet.\\n If you have purchased a domain, the information stored with your Domain registrar is what is passed on to the Registry for the Whois database.
