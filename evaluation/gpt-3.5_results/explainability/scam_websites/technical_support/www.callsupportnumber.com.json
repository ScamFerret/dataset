The website is accessible, now I need to extract the text and hyperlinks to check for any scam characteristics. The website seems to be offering support services for various tech-related issues, which is a common characteristic of scam websites. I also noticed that the website has a disclaimer and privacy policy, but the content of the website seems to be generic and lacks specific details about the company or the services offered. This could indicate that the company may not be legitimate. Additionally, the website does not offer any product for sale, which is another characteristic of scam websites.
