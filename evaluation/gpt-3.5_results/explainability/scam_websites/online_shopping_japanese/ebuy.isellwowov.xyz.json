There are no characteristics of a scam website present in the HTML text, but I need to check if the domain name information from WHOIS and retrieve the certificate information to confirm. The WHOIS information shows a registered domain with contact information and no red flags. I will now retrieve the certificate information to complete my analysis. The certificate information shows that the domain has valid SSL certificates issued by reputable authorities. Based on the lack of scam characteristics in the HTML text, the registered domain with valid contact information, and valid SSL certificates, it is likely that the website is not a scam. {",
