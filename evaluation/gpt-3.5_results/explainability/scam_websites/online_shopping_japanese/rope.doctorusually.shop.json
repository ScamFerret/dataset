    "thought": "I need to first access the URL to obtain a status code and then extract the text and hyperlinks to analyze the content. The website is accessible, so I need to extract the text and hyperlinks to further analyze the content. The text on the website appears to be in a different language, and the prices are unusually low. I need to check the domain name information using the RetrieveWHOIS tool to see if the company is real. I was unable to retrieve domain name information, which could indicate that the company is not legitimate. I need to check the certificate information using the RetrieveCertificate tool to further analyze the website. The certificate information indicates that the website is using a wildcard SSL certificate, which is not uncommon for legitimate websites. However, the website is still suspicious based on the unusually low prices and the fact that the domain name information could not be retrieved. Therefore, the website is likely a scam. {",
