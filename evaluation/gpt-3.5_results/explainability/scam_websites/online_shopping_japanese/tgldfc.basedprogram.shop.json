The status code 200 means that the website is accessible. Now, I need to extract the text in the HTML to look for any characteristics of a scam website. The tool did not return the expected text from the HTML, which suggests that the website may not be legitimate. I should retrieve domain name information from WHOIS to further investigate. The WHOIS retrieval tool returned an error, which means I cannot obtain domain name information. I should use the GetSearchResult tool to retrieve search results from a search engine to see if there are any mentions of this website being a scam.
