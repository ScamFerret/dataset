The WHOIS information for the domain \"stepion.cfd\" indicates that it was registered in China and has contact information redacted for privacy. The domain status is listed as \"ok.\" This does not provide any direct evidence of being a scam website, but the nonsensical content and unrelated products and prices still suggest that it is likely a scam website.
