    "thought": "I need to start by accessing the URL to obtain a status code and then extract the text from the website. The website is accessible. Now I need to extract the text from the website to look for any characteristics of a scam website. I can see that the website is offering free shipping and unusually low prices on wedding dresses, which is a characteristic of a scam website. I also need to check the company information and the privacy policy to see if they are legitimate. The hyperlinks do not provide any information about the company or the privacy policy. I need to retrieve the domain name information from WHOIS to see if the company is legitimate. The domain information shows that the registrant name is \"Domain Admin\" and the organization is \"Whoisprotection.cc,\" which is suspicious. Additionally, the website offers free shipping and unusually low prices, which are characteristics of a scam website. Based on these observations, the website https://www.clearancegowns.com/ is determined to be a scam website. {",
