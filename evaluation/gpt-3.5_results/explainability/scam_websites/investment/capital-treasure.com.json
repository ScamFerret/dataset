    "thought": "I need to start by accessing the URL to obtain its status code and then extract the text and hyperlinks from the website to analyze its content. The website is accessible, so I will proceed to extract the text and hyperlinks to further analyze its content. The website seems to be offering unusually high returns on investment, which is a characteristic of a scam website. I need to check the WHOIS information and the DNS records to further analyze the website. The WHOIS information shows that the domain is registered, but the registrant details are hidden behind a privacy proxy service, which is a red flag. I will now check the DNS records for further analysis. The DNS record for capital-treasure.com did not return any relevant information. This, combined with the hidden registrant details, leads me to believe that the website is a scam. {",
