    "thought": "I need to start by accessing the URL to obtain a status code and then extract the text and hyperlinks from the website to look for any suspicious characteristics. The website is accessible, now I need to extract the text and hyperlinks from the website. The text on the website does not have any obvious characteristics of a scam website, but I need to check the domain name information from WHOIS to see if the company is legitimate. There was an error retrieving the domain name information from WHOIS. I should retrieve the certificate information from crt.sh to see if there are any red flags.

However, the error retrieving domain name information from WHOIS is suspicious. I need to search for any posts containing keywords from X/Twitter to see if there are any reports or complaints about this website. I now know the final answer {",
