    "question": "Please analyze this URL https://capital-trade.net/",
    "thought": "I need to check the content of the given URL to determine if it is a scam website or not. The website is live and accessible. The website claims to be a mining company, stock exchange, and oil market operator. There are also claims of providing investment solutions for oil, stock trading, and mining for blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The website also mentions providing a well-structured way to grow your portfolio and being covered by insurance. The website also claims to have been operating since 1983 and has a physical address in New Zealand. It seems to be a legitimate investment company, but I need to check the domain information to verify its legitimacy. The website is registered by a privacy protection service, which is a common practice. However, the content of the website seems to align with the characteristics of a scam website. The claims of being a mining company, stock exchange, and oil market operator, along with providing investment solutions for various industries, are too broad and unrealistic. Additionally, the unusually low prices and claims of free services are not evident. The registration information being protected by a privacy service does not necessarily indicate a scam, but it adds to the suspicion. Based on the characteristics of a scam website, it is likely that this website is a scam. - result: True",
    "answer": {
        "result": "True",
        "scam_type": "Fake investment company",
        "reason": "The website makes unrealistic claims about its services targeting human psychological weaknesses by promising high returns and security. The information on the website is not consistent with the characteristics of a legitimate investment company and the domain registration being protected by a privacy service adds to the suspicion."
