The website is accessible, now I need to extract the text and hyperlinks to look for scam characteristics. I don't see any obvious scam characteristics in the extracted text, but I should still check for any unusual claims or information on non-existent companies. There are no hyperlinks on the website, which is unusual for a legitimate website. I should check the WHOIS information for the domain to see if it's associated with any suspicious activity. The WHOIS information does not provide any registrant, admin, tech, or billing details, which is suspicious. I should also check if there are any search results related to this website. The search results show that the website is associated with Shiba Inu cryptocurrency, and there are claims of being able to become a millionaire with just $10, which is a characteristic of scam websites. Based on the search results and the WHOIS information, it's likely that this is a scam website. - result: True",
