The website is accessible, now I need to extract the text from the HTML to see if there are any signs of fraudulent activity. Based on the text extracted from the HTML, the website seems to be selling a wide variety of products, including fashion items, beauty products, and even sex products. This could indicate handling different products from common e-commerce websites, which is a characteristic of fraudulent sites. I should also check the WHOIS information to see if the company exists. The website is registered, and the WHOIS information shows that the registrant is based in China. This aligns with the characteristic of non-existent companies. The website also offers a wide range of products, including sex products, and the WHOIS information indicates that the registrant's email is from China.
