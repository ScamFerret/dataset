The text extracted does not seem to be related to the characteristics of a scam website. I should check for any unusual hyperlinks or contact information on the website. The extracted hyperlinks do not seem to be related to the characteristics of a scam website. I should check the domain name information to see if it is associated with any suspicious activities.
