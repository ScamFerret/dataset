The website is accessible, now I need to extract the text to analyze for scam characteristics. The website does not have unusually low prices or claims of free, nor does it claim to be able to get an amount of money that is generally not possible. There are no texts targeting human psychological weaknesses, and the information on the company seems legitimate. The products are also common for an e-commerce website.
