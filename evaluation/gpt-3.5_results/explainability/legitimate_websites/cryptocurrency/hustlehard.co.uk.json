    "question": "Please analyze this URL https://hustlehard.co.uk/",
    "thought": "I should start by accessing the URL to obtain a status code. The website is accessible, now I need to extract the text from the website to look for any suspicious claims or information. I can see that the website offers trading courses and information on forex, stocks, and crypto trading. There are no unusually low prices or claims of free, and the content does not make unrealistic claims about the amount of money that can be made. The text does not seem to target human psychological weaknesses or contain information on non-existent companies. I should check the payment methods and the privacy policy to make a final determination. The website offers links to open live trading accounts, demo trading accounts, an eShop, and complete trading courses. The payment methods are common, such as Stripe. I should now check the privacy policy. I cannot extract the privacy policy text directly, so I will use the RetrieveDNSRecord tool to gather more information about the domain. The DNS record shows that the domain is hosted on a legitimate server. I now know the final answer The URL https://hustlehard.co.uk/ is not a scam website.",
