It offers unusually low prices for antivirus products and other software. The text also contains a lot of marketing language and targets the customer's need for security and protection. The inquiry phone number and email address are provided, but it is unclear if they are appropriate for business use. There is no clear privacy policy or terms and conditions mentioned. The information on the website has not been updated, as it claims to have 29 happy clients and 41 projects completed, but the copyright notice at the bottom of the page is for 2019.
