The tech is new and ever-evolving – it helps to have a guide. Here's what we recommend you do if you want to dive in. Pick a wallet A wallet lets you connect to Ethereum and manage your funds. ETH is the currency of Ethereum – you can use it in applications. Use a dapp Dapps are applications powered by Ethereum. See what you can do. Start building If you want to start coding with Ethereum, we have documentation, tutorials, and more in our developer portal. Ethereum is a technology that's home to digital money, global payments, and applications. The community has built a booming digital economy, bold new ways for creators to earn online, and so much more. It's open to everyone, wherever you are in the world – all you need is the internet. More on digital money A fairer financial system Today, billions of people can’t open bank accounts, others have their payments blocked. Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) system never sleeps or discriminates. With just an internet connection, you can send, receive, borrow, earn interest, and even stream funds anywhere in the world. Explore DeFi The internet of assets Ethereum isn't just for digital money. Anything you can own can be represented, traded and put to use as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). You can tokenise your art and get royalties automatically every time it's re-sold. Or use a token for something you own to take out a loan. The possibilities are growing all the time. More on NFTs An open internet Today, we gain access to 'free' internet services by giving up control of our personal data. Ethereum services are open by default – you just need a wallet. These are free and easy to set up, controlled by you, and work without any personal info. Explore the open internet More on wallets Code examples Your own bank You can build a bank run by logic you've programmed. Your own currency You can create tokens that you can transfer and use across applications. A JavaScript Ethereum wallet You can use existing languages to interact with Ethereum and other applications. An open, permissionless DNS You can reimagine existing services as decentralized, open applications. A new frontier for development Ethereum and its apps are transparent and open source. You can fork code and re-use functionality others have already built. If you don't want to learn a new language you can just interact with open-sourced code using JavaScript and other existing languages. Developer portal Ethereum today The latest network statistics ETH price (USD) The latest price for 1 ether. You can buy as little as 0.000000000000000001 – you don't need to buy 1 whole ETH. 30d 90d 0 Transactions today The number of transactions successfully processed on the network in the last 24 hours. Value locked in DeFi (USD) The amount of money in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, the Ethereum digital economy. Nodes Ethereum is run by thousands of volunteers around the globe, known as nodes.

Additionally, the website does not provide any legitimate information about the organization or company behind it, and the payment method for the airdrop is not common. The website also contains texts that target human psychological weaknesses by offering free money and making unrealistic claims. Based on these observations, the website is likely a scam. {",
