        "thought": "The website does not have unusually low prices or claims of free. It also does not claim to be able to get an amount of money that is generally not possible. The text does not seem to target human psychological weaknesses, and the company information seems to be legitimate. The website offers IT services and does not handle different products from common e-commerce websites. The contact information provided seems appropriate for business use, and the privacy of customer information notation is clear. The payment methods are not listed, so it's unclear if they are unusual. The information on the website does not indicate that it has not been updated. The website https://frontrange-pc.com/ does not appear to be a scam website based on the characteristics analyzed.",
