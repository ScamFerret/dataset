Upcoming Forums Past Forums ABOUT CLSA EVENTS CITICS / CLSA’s Investor Forums have been a key differentiator for our Equities business for many years and represent the very best that our clients value about our franchise: thought-leadership, market-leading Research and world-class Corporate Access. Hosting a large Flagship Investors’ Forum (IF) in the Autumn continues to be a strategic priority for the firm. We will announce details on this year’s IF in due course. More than ever before, this year’s IF will leverage the large number of deep relationships that CITICS has developed over many years as China’s leading investment bank with corporates across China. We look forward to welcoming our clients to this year’s Japan Forum (Tokyo: Grand Hyatt Roppongi Hills, May 19-21; already announced) and India Forum (during Q4; exact dates still tbc). kai.kaufmann@clsa.com Alternative Investment Login: Forums Overview About Who is CITIC CLSA?
