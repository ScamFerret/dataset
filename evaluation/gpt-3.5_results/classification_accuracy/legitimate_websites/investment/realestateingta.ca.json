REMEMBER…THE #1 RULE IN REAL ESTATE…LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! JOHN ALKINS Broker of Record Alkins Real Estate began in 1948 with the same attributes that we share with our clients today: a strict code of ethics, honesty, and genuine care for our client’s needs. It’s been part of our continued success and the reason why so many of our clients return to us. Our early beginnings involved selling land to homebuilders and industrial developers in the emerging community of Etobiocke. Today, we sell houses and condos; we sell and lease commercial, industrial and investment properties. We are often involved in estate trust transactions, matrimonial, tax situations and real estate appraisals. JUDY ALKINS Salesperson Buy – Sell – List – Invest in Properties With Confidence List With Us Listing Announcements Does Size Matter? When selecting a Toronto real estate company, does the size of the company matter? Some buyers and sellers believe that using the real estate services of a large real estate brokerage with a well-known name will help to sell their property more quickly. When, in fact, it is the individual agent that will help you and not the company’s name on the sign. So what would make one Toronto real estate company better than another? It is the real estate service, commitment, product knowledge and experience a client recognizes.
