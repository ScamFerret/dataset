Log In APPLY NOW Refer a friend and receive an extra 10% rewards per install. Let’s deal with the elephant in the room first. Helium Club will NEVER ask you for any payment information. No bank account details. No credit card numbers. No PayPal login. We will provide and install a Helium Hotspot in your home for free, and then pay you every month as a thank you for being a part of the Helium Network ​ In the interest of setting realistic expectations, our hosting service is not a “get-rich-quick” scheme, not everyone can have one, and it (probably) won’t make you a crypto millionaire over-night. So, with that out of the way, here’s how you could earn a passive monthly income with Helium Club… You provide us with some basic information about yourself and your property using our online application This will also generate your Personal Referral Link, but more on that later. We use online software to conduct a remote survey of your property and the surrounding area, including your proximity and line-of-sight to active Helium Hotspots. This may include a proof of residency check. We send you a link to our T&Cs, which you can electronically sign using your phone, tablet or computer. This digital document ensures that both parties are protected, and also allows us to book your installation date. We will call you to book a suitable time and date for our engineers to install your new Helium Hotspot. The hotspot is usually installed near your broadband router, with the antenna being fixed to the outside of your property. The hotspot will “mine” a crypto-currency called Helium (HNT) through a process called “Proof of Coverage” using LoRaWAN technology. This is an automatic process and does not require you to do anything. On the last Friday of every month, we pay you 15% of the HNT that has been mined by your Helium Hotspot. This is a completely passive income that requires no investment or action from you. Your 15% for being a host is just the beginning of your potential earnings. You will also have a Personal Referral Link. If anyone uses your link and has a Hotspot installed, we will pay you 10% of the Helium (HNT) mined from their hotspot, even if you don’t have one yourself. There is no cap on referrals. The more you refer, the more you get paid every month. Every day we connect to the Internet. But it’s not just people. Introducing the Helium Hotspot — a new wireless device that enables anyone to earn cryptocurrency by building a wireless network in their city and creating a more connected future.
