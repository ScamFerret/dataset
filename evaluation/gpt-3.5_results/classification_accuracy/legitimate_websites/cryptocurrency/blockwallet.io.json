What is a non custodial wallet A Non-Custodial Wallet, also known as a Self-Custodial Wallet or Self-Custody Wallet, is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that places complete control over digital assets in your hands. Unlike other wallet options where third parties have access to your private keys,** a Non-Custodial Wallet ensures only you possess these keys**. Essentially, this means that only you can access or move your cryptocurrencies - nobody else has this ability. This style of wallet provides unparalleled security and autonomy, allowing you to maintain total sovereignty over your digital assets. However, it's important to remember that the responsibility of keeping your keys and recovery phrases safe falls solely on you. In short, Non-Custodial Wallets put the 'private' back in private keys, giving you full control and ownership over your cryptocurrency assets. Why Self-Custody In Crypto Wallets Are Important The importance of self-custody in cryptocurrencies cannot be overstated. Self-custody crypto wallets offer users unparalleled control over their digital assets, ensuring that you alone have access to your funds. This level of personal control is crucial where centralized platforms can present significant risks. For example, centralized exchanges and wallets are frequent targets for hackers, and users may also face the risk of internal fraud, regulatory changes, or even bankruptcy—all of which can jeopardize the safety of your assets. The recent history of cryptocurrency has shown that these are not just theoretical risks; many investors have faced substantial losses in such scenarios. There were some cases where users could not withdraw their digital assets because centralized exchanges halted all withdrawals. Self-custody crypto wallets, such as BlockWallet, put the power firmly in your hands. These wallets, protected by private keys that you exclusively control, offer a level of security unattainable by centralized systems. Moreover, self-custody crypto wallets enhance your financial autonomy and privacy. Is BlockWallet Self custodial wallet Yes, indeed! BlockWallet certainly puts the \"self\" in \"self-custodial\"!
