As our project progress, several real estate concepts will be introduced for our community to enjoy. Our app utilizes a process called cloud-based crypto mining, which allows everyone with a smartphone to earn Remint effortlessly. Remint invites you to be part of the real estate revolution as it begins to merge with cryptocurrency. Download Our App Join our fast-growing community and earn up to 0.6 Remint/hour with our remote mining app for Android and iOS. In addition, the app consumes minimal battery usage on our users’ phones. Start earning Remint today! All you have to do is download the Remint app, create an account with us and begin your remote mining session (with the push of a button). Now you are all set and can enjoy watching your Remint balance grow. Real Estate Based Our main goal is to simplify real estate transactions and investments. We are building a platform where real estate meets cryptocurrency in various ways, e.g., we will provide the ability to purchase and rent real estate. In addition, users will be able to invest in different real estate projects to earn an interest rate that will deposit directly into their wallet or Remint debit card. We are also launching a real estate project in the metaverse, which we will announce later. The metaverse platform will be available through the Remint app as well. What is Remint? Remint is a real estate cryptocurrency with a big vision to make a revolutionary impact on two of the world’s leading industries, i.e., the real estate market and the realm of decentralized finance (cryptocurrency). The main objective is to unite these industries and shorten the gap. We have specified this in our white paper, where a more detailed version is available. In the present phase (as of 28 February 2022), members of the Remint community can download our app for free (available on the app stores) to earn Remint coins. This possibility DOES NOT require you as a user to spend any form of financial assets to reap the benefits of this project. However, time is of the essence here; therefore, a few minutes a day (more or less) is required to grow your Remint balance. What do we offer? Join our community while we’re still mining and be part of the transformation of the real estate industry with real estate cryptocurrency! We offer a free real estate crypto mining app, making it easy for you to earn Remint without any actual mining on your device, but instead using “Remint cloud-based crypto mining”. It is free, easy and an excellent investment in your future cryptocurrency real estate needs. Why integrate blockchain into the real estate market? The usage of blockchain technology and smart contracts are highly beneficial in the real estate market. Here are a few examples of that: – Contract processes are easier to handle To increase your earnings, you should focus on referring new users. In our new and improved referral system, you will gain a 25%  higher mining rate per referred user. So, for example, if you refer ten users, you will earn +250% from your standard mining rate.Also, make sure to activate the bonus and mining button in time and regularly participate in our social media competitions. The mining rigs are already set up and running on the cloud, meaning that the entire process is conducted without support from our users’ phones. Instead, our server communicates with each telephone to record the earnings of Remint coins. Hence, no extra battery is being used in the process, and therefore no noticeable loss of battery will occur. Yes, due to the current growth and demand for such projects, we are planning a real estate metaverse project to be included in the app. More info about this will announce in later stages.
