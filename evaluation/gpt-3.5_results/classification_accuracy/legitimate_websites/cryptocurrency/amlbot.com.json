The overall risk (percentage) is the probability that the address is associated with illegal activity. The sources of risk are the known types of services with which the address has interacted and the percentage of funds accepted from / given to these services for which the overall risk is calculated. What do the parameters in the check results mean? AMLBot checks the specified wallet address for connections to known blockchain services. AMLBot conventionally groups these services into groups with different levels of risk of illegal activity. The check shows the connections of the checked address to these groups as a percentage. Based on all the links, an average risk score is given, which helps the user to make further decisions about the assets. How do I understand risk assessment? Each client determines for himself what percentage of risk is acceptable for him. Conventionally, the risk score can be divided as follows: page How quickly is the balance replenished? After transaction confirmation, the balance is replenished: What does the percentage risk score mean? AMLBot finds links of a verified address to different users in the blockchain, each with a different conditional risk score. How does AMLBot help to protect you against blocking? By checking counterparties' wallets before a transaction, you can reject their assets if the risk score is high. Also, before transferring funds to other services, you can check your wallet address and save the result (make a screenshot). The risk is higher than 50%, but I am certain that the address is reliable. What to do? The verification results are based on international databases, which are constantly updated. So an address that had 0% risk yesterday may have received or given the asset to a risky counterparty today. In this case, the risk score will change. If you want to be sure of the result and determine what the cause of the high risk is, we can do a detailed check for you. To do so, email us at info@amlbot.com What is the difference between an address and transaction checks? Address (wallet) check is an analysis of all addresses ever associated with it, from which funds were received and to which funds were sent. Check transaction (you need to specify TxID) and then you select: What happens if I don't use all my checks each month? They stay within your account, and you can use them at any time. How often are checks recommended to do? An answer to this depends on your unique risk model. The general recommendation would be to perform an AML check every time you interact with an unknown wallet or a smart contract. What cryptocurrencies does AMLBot analyze? AMLBot supports all major blockchains and tokens on them. We are constantly adding support for additional cryptocurrencies. You can always check the up-to-date list of supported cryptocurrencies in web dashboard API Documentation What if I will need more checks? You can buy additional checks as needed. The number of checks is always displayed within your user information.
