Dedicated Support Team Submit a ticket here Extensive Knowledge Base See how NuFi works here Round-the-clock Advice Ask questions on Discord here FAQ’s It says that NuFi is compatible with all decentralized applications (Dapps); how does that work? You can use NuFi with decentralized applications (Dapps) on all 5 supported blockchains. What’s more, NuFi is compatible with all Cardano, Ethereum, Milkomeda C1 and Solana Dapps thanks to Wallet Emulation mode, which lets NuFi connect in place of popular wallets (as long as these wallet extensions are disabled). This makes NuFi instantly usable with all your favourite Dapps. Try it yourself (after installing NuFi): disable MetaMask, then go to NFT marketplace OpenSea.io I've read that NuFi is non-custodial. What does that mean? Non-custodial means that you alone control your wallet’s private keys, giving you (and only you) unconditional ownership and control of your assets at all times. With a non-custodial wallet like NuFi, there’s no middleman who could restrict access to your wallet or the crypto stored in it. I want to stake my crypto but I'm worried about losing access to my funds; can I unstake and transfer my crypto whenever I want? Yes! Your crypto can be unstaked and transferred at any time. When you stake your crypto, your funds never leave your wallet and you don’t transfer ownership of your crypto to anyone. Some blockchains (such as Solana) impose a short ‘cooldown’ period after unstaking, meaning you may need to wait a couple of days for the blockchain to close your staking account and make your funds available to transfer. Other blockchains (such as Cardano) don’t lock funds while they’re staked, meaning you can transfer funds out of your wallet at any time without needing to unstake them first. I already have a wallet; if I migrate it to NuFi, will my wallet’s balance, receiving address and staking setup be the same? Yes! If you already have a non-custodial wallet (e.g. AdaLite, Eternl, MetaMask, or Phantom), you can use your existing seed phrase to migrate your wallet to NuFi. When you do that, you’ll see that your wallet’s receiving address(es), assets, transaction history and staking setup are exactly the same with no further action needed. Can I store NFTs in my NuFi wallet? Can I transfer them too? Yes! Your NuFi wallet lets you securely store, manage and bulk-send multiple NFTs on all supported blockchains. What’s more, NuFi’s in-app NFT gallery brings your collections to life by visually displaying your NFTs side by side. medium reddit github © 2023 NuFi All rights reserved NuFi AG, Arbachstrasse 60B, 6340 Baar, Switzerland Create a new wallet I am subscribing to product updates.
