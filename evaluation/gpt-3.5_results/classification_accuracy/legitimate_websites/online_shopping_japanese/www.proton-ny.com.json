My first impressions are shared below: \\n\\nBased on my limited time with it, I do recommend playing Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord on the PSVR2, but you should keep reading to decide for yourself.\\n\\nIt is a game designed with co-op for up to 4P set in a faithful recreation of the Ghostbusters universe, but the option to play co-op (including cross-play) doesn't open up until you complete the intro and one mandatory Infestation Mission ([18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&t=1085s)). Once you are past those, you can visit the main-menu ([24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&t=1440s)) and choose to host or join another player. The game supports standard Invite / Join system for your friends on the same VR platform and provides a lengthy 8-digit room code for friends on other VR platforms like Meta Quest ([24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&t=1498s)). The game also supports quick match to join you to those players that are playing as host and open to public.\\n\\nThe game is set in San Francisco and setup with a simple story setup that you will go through during the intro which also serves as your tutorial introducing you to familiar elements from Ghostbusters franchise such as PKE Meter, Ghost Trap, and Neutrono Wand (your proton stream weapon). Beyond the intro, where you are guided by female voice named Gabriela, she will continue to be your guide providing instructions and story context as you join the Ghostbusters. The central hub also has TV broadcast providing additional story context as the game continues.\\n\\nThe central hub is a Fire Station with stations for training ([24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&t=1454s)), upgrading equipment ([28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&t=1682s)), selecting player avatar and selecting missions. If playing co-op, especially once a cross-player is added (not sure why, but it seems to boost mic volumes), you will probably have to use settings to tweak audio so that VOIP is audible without being too loud ([29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&t=1750s)).  Once the game has given you ability to play co-op, you can continue solo or co-op by choosing from a number of different mission types across different locations, each time earning you currency you can use in the player hub area (fire station) to upgrade either your PKE Meter, Ghost Trap or Neutrono Wand.\\n\\nThe game original launched with 4 mission types, but 2 more were added post-launch:\\n\\n* Infestation ([30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&t=1800s)) allows you to go through a location with some small ghost encounters, ending with a ghost boss encounter.\\n* Exorcism involves closing a portal, but to do this you have to use your PKE Meter to find 3 particular items, attach them to generators and unleash Ghost Boss encounter.\\n* On The Clock is a mode where you fight against waves of enemies to ensure you can clear area in time permitted.\\n* Giga Trap Retrieval involves finding correct location of trap and carefully extracting it which can have variety of effects that made it exciting.\\n* Harvester involves repairing a machine and capturing ghosts.\\n* Heist & Seek ([43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&t=2580s)) is a competitive mode where players go through multiple ghost encounters to catch golden ghosts while competing for who got the most gold.\\n\\nYou are expected to play these mission types repeatedly in the variety of locations for as long as you like. To complete the game, there are also story related missions involving additional characters and battle(s?) with Ghost Lord. We haven't played those yet. While playing co-op if any player is downed, they must high-five one of the remaining players to get revived. They are free to move around in their downed state.\\n\\nWhile playing you can encounter marshmallow packs which will attach a bunch of annoying mini-pufts to your body and Neutrono Wand. They have to be smacked (either by you or your allies) to resume ability for your weapon to work. At least one time in what we played (not covered in gameplay shared) my weapon wouldn't resume working even though we had gotten rid of all the mini-pufts. The game also hard crashed the time we tried playing Exorcism mid-mission so expect the possibility of some frustrating bugs that aren't patched way yet.\\n\\nIt looks like a simpler game than it is because there is skill involved in how you beam on to the tougher enemies where you first have have to take down their shield and then lasso-pull them to drain their health. While you are doing that, there is audio and even a visual temperature meter that displays on the ghost you are lasso-pulling and have to press X to give them a big hit or risk overheating your proton weapon. Then you have to place a trap and capture them before they recover. All while avoiding any area effect or projectile attacks that the ghosts are doing.\\n\\nWorth mentioning that the game defaults to smooth locomotion, but does offer option to change to teleport. It also offers blinders which are off by default. It defaults to a quick-turn option which is a happy medium between snap turn and smooth turn (both offered).\\n\\nI think it is much harder to play with teleport because you can't strafe out of the way of projectiles while maintaining fire, so if you would play with teleport (for VR comfort reasons), you should plan to be playing co-op rather than solo. Speaking of which, I actually wouldn't recommend this game for solo even if you can play with default of smooth locomotion because I think it is more fun co-op and also feels balanced for more players. I had to play on my wife's game just to help her get past the tutorial fights required solo so she could play co-op with us, and it wasn't as fun and I had to change to smooth locomotion to be able to complete it easier, then back to teleport for her VR comfort.\\n\\nThe game is using resistive triggers and haptic feedback in the controllers. I haven't felt any in haptics in the headset. \", 'comments': ['Thank you for writing this. I have been considering it because it’s on sale. Will I be able to find other players if I purchase it? If it’s made to be played in coop it might not be as enjoyable alone. Also, should I spring for the season pass?', 'Thanks for this in depth analysis.', 'It’s a cool game, I feel like ghostbusters rise of ghostlord and spirits unleashed feel more like a real ghostbusters cartoon episode than a movie.', \">Worth mentioning that the game defaults to smooth locomotion, but does offer option to change to teleport.
