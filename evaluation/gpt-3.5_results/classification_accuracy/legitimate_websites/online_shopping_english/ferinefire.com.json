Achieve NAR-vana with these true ABOUT THE ARTIST Rebecca Kemp For as long as I can remember I've always loved science and nature. I've always had pets, and those of us who has grown up with them know you learn so much from them. I've also always been fascinated with the cosmos. When I was very little, I used to study the stars and planets. I found out about constellations and the mythological stories behind them. When I found that a lot of it pertained to animals - BINGO! - that's when the love for fantasy and wildlife bloomed. My love for H.P. Lovecraft came later when I went to college.
