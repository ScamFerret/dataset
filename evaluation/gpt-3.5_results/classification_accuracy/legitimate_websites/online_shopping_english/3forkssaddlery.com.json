More recently, we have added the Three Forks Ortho-Roper, Ultimate Roper, and the All-Around Saddle Pads. These signature, seamless pads are built with laminated contoured construction for a superb fit. A memory foam top allows the pad to thin out and disperse pressure evenly while the bottom foam layer is a full rebound material to accept shock at every stride. The advanced design of these pads allows for the bridging of technology and a hand-crafted product that offers many orthopedic benefits. All styles come equipped with your choice of either a hospital grade felt or neoprene bottom. Testimonials \"Amazing folks! So helpful!
