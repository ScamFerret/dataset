BitcoinX Trading When Bitcoin was first introduced into the public markets in 2009, the world’s first cryptocurrency was barely noticed. However, there was a small group of innovation-minded investors who instantly recognized the great potential of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. These early investors eventually reaped huge rewards when Bitcoin attained record highs of just under $20,000 by 2017. Since then, after a brief downturn, Bitcoin has even surpassed that previous record and has been continuously climbing upwards. Is the BitcoinX a Scam?
