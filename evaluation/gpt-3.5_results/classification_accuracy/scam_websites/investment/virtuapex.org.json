        "thought": "The text on the website contains claims of being able to earn up to 15% daily, which is not a realistic return on investment. Additionally, it mentions investing in cryptocurrency, real estate, and earning online, which is a common theme in scam websites. The website also uses psychological targeting by mentioning financial freedom, passive income, and flexible conditions. There is no clear information about the company, and the privacy policy is not easily accessible. The investment plans and the amount of investment received seem unrealistic. These are all characteristics of a scam website.",
