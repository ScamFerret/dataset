Get it Now! Gumby is back in two unspeakable adventures that test the limits of claymation and decency! The Amazing Bulk may not actually be a movie. It seems like it was assembled by pressing “random shuffle” on video software from the 90s, then pouring the results into a blender with a “superhero movie” button. Zack and Ashlee, outcasts at school, start seeing visions of a superhero with a blue mullet. They bring him to life, and he teaches them about friendship through song. Hangmen is a spy thriller involving a lot of schlubby guys and a commando named Dog Thompson who lives in a junkyard. Kaan Woo is about to retire, but his co-workers are evil kung fu monks who kick you when they’re sad. So, naturally, Kaan transfers his consciousness into the body of a nearby passed-out hobo. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Advance: On Previous Next Own the Live Shows! Latest RiffTrax Movies!
