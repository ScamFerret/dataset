The SS Rex is from the same team that brought you the 1/350 SS Normandie Ocean Liner. This four year project is a 100% new model and represents the Rex in her glory years of the mid 1930s. All design work was done in CAD by Ken Friend, a master modeler, designer and builder of experimental engines and test equipment and an engineer who specialized in CAD/CAM/CAE Systems Management and Implementation.  All of the smaller parts are printed on ultra-high resolution 3D SLA resin printers. These parts meet and often exceed what is possible with injection molded plastic. Only the larger parts (hull, deck pieces and funnels)are cast resin. These are pressure-cast from de-aired molds to minimize air bubbles.  The Italian Line advertised that \"The Southern Route Is the Lido Deck Route.\" By virtue of avoiding the stormy and cold North Atlantic, travelers experienced a true outdoor lifestyle. The Rex was intentionally designed for this. For this model, extensive research and time was spent capturing the exact look of the colorful 1st and 2nd Class Aft Pool Areas- from the changing room & showers, grab rope on the pool, pool slide, stairs & diving boards, tables with umbrellas, recessed (covered) 1st Class Restaurant/Lounge and more.  Because of the superior performance of 3D Printing, over 90% of the usual PE (photoetched) metal parts are now 3D printed resin. This is a vast improvement as they are no longer flat, but are true to the shape of the prototype. This also makes for a nearly complete model \"out-of-the-box.\"  Includes a real wood deck from Scaledecks.  NOTE: railings are the only parts not included with the model shown. They are not required to complete the kit, however 1/350 railings are sold by a vast number of aftermarket sources.  I will refer all buyers to the sources that I believe work the best with the kit. more info > Aurora Lightning P-38 - Famous Fighters of All Nations, 1/48, 99-98 Plastic Model Kit,   Box Condition: Good $125 Rare.  Third issue with rectangular 'Aurora Line' logo and Famous Fighters of All Nations on the box top.  The box has four solid and original corners, no repairs, tags, tag marks or tape (other than the factory sealing tape) but has moderate wear and very light age foxing as shown, hence the grade of 'good.'  Inside, this model is molded in a stunning and beautiful correct gloss medium blue plastic and clear.  It includes the correct early rectangular clear stand and stand arm.  The model has never been started and is inventoried 100% complete with all parts, decals and instructions present.  Even the original factory tissue packing paper is present.  NOTE: the decal were previously stuck to the instructions in several small areas.  The actual transfers are in 'excellent' condition; the damage is to the backing paper only. Monogram US Air Force Refueling Group B-47 And KC-135, 1/240, P409-49 $295 Very rare, one and only issue dated 1960.  When Monogram invested in the tooling for the 18 aircraft \"Air Power\" set, the sales did not meet expectations.  In order to increase revenue from the molds, Monogram issued three separate kits- the \"Refueling Group,\" \"Bomber Group\" and \"Fighter Group\" in the \"Forty Niner\" series with the Tu-16 Badger, F-101 and P-40.  These kits utilized aircraft from the Air Power set with special blue-molded  display stands, unique decals and instructions.  The two aircraft are well molded with recessed panel line detail.  Decals are in amazing 'near mint' condition and the instructions in 'near mint+' condition.  Never started.  Inventoried 100% complete with all parts, decals and instructions present.  NOTE: this kit must be shipped double-boxed for protection. Plant Models Messerschmitt Bf-261 V-2 Adolfine - Ultra-Long Range Aircraft - (Bf261V-2 / Me261 V-2), 1/72, 231 $64 Very high quality kit of the Luftwaffe version of V-2.  The kit features high-definition cast resin parts with fine recessed panel lines, cast white metal main gear struts and tail wheel strut & wheel, very good cockpit & crew stations and high quality vacuformed clear canopies (two) that are in mint condition; perfectly clear and no yellowing.  The kit has never been started.  The parts are all still in the factory sealed bags and includes decals, instructions with aircraft history.   P.1067 was the designation for the design that would fly the Olympic Torch non-stop from Berlin to Tokyo for the 1940 Olympic games.  The specialized, long range monoplane eventually took the name Bf-261 when V1 and V2 were built.  Power was provided by two DB 606A-1/B-1 coupled engines, each of which was a pair of DB601 liquid-cooled mounts driving a very large four bladed propeller.  There was a crew of 5 and bunks were provided.  The work slowed as hostilities picked up.  Without it's intended mission, the 261 was considered for ultra-long range reconnaissance over the Atlantic Ocean, but the difficulty of fixing proper defensive guns caused engineers to give up the project.  The three aircraft were used for performance calibration flights, some of very long range (almost 2,800 miles).  V3 did see action in very long range military reconnaissance.  No further aircraft were built.  The Luftwaffe took all three of the Bf-261s into service with hopes of using them for very long range operations.  V-1 and V-2 were extensively tested and modified for this purpose; their wartime participation is not known, only that both were damaged beyond repair at Lechfeld Airfield and scrapped in 1944 or 45.  It is known that V-3 flew very long range, secret reconnaissance missions to the East and the West while in Luftwaffe colors.  The fate of V-3 is not known. Jo-Han 1956 Plymouth Belvedere Taxi Promo - Short Kit - (Promotional Model), 1/25 $18 Includes the yellow body with 'TAXI' pad printed on the rear doors, green-tinted windshield, two red-tinted clear tail light lenses and chrome plated front & rear bumpers and four wheels/hub caps.  The chrome plating is in 'near mint' condition with only very slight and small flaws.  This is called a 'short kit' because it does not include an interior, steering wheel, rubber tires or axles.  These are from the original Jo-Han molds but are likely reproductions made in the 1990s.  They came with a collection of promo bodies, windshields and chrome parts.  Please note that these are made with a newer plastic that has very good gloss but does not warp.  These are perfect replacements if you wish to restore your warped Plymouth Promo.

Drone Engineering Secret Weapon  - Spectacular Disel Flyer - 38 Inch Wingspan Super Stunt Control Line Model Designed For Diesel Engine Wood Model Kit,   Box Condition: Fair- Very rare and from 1948.  This is a completely prefabricated, balsa and hardwood super-stunt control line design by Leon Shulman.  At that time it was capable of doing every possible maneuver that control line models could perform and some that could not be done, such as a loop and vertical 8's.  It can literally be built in a few hours and features factory cut and carved, high-quality wooden parts, shaped and hollowed leading edges, tapered training edges, hardware, fully formed wire landing gear (or to be used as a take-off trolley that remained on the runway to improve performance), covering tissue and more.

Horizontal stabilizer and elevator are very neatly sanded.  There is no other assembly.  The model has been inventoried 100% complete with all parts and paperwork included.  Please note that the covering tissue has bug damage.  In 1948 Drone Diesel also produced and marketed the 'Dronette' Sport Flyer & Stunt Trainer and the 'Hot-Rock,' a National Open Stunt Champion in 1947.  These model, with the 'Secret Weapon,' promoted 'Diesel At Its Best,' the Drone Diesel Engine with a Class B displacement of .297, bore of 21/32 and Stroke of 7/8\".

This was a nice kit for the time featuring 'good' cockpit detail, pilot and student figures, rotating prop and USAF decals. Molded in silver and clear. The kit has never been started. It has been inventoried complete with all parts and includes decals and instructions.

Pyro Brig of War American Privateer, B368-75 Dated 1967 and has great artwork.  This kit represents one of the earliest ships built by Yankee craftsman during the Revolutionary War.
