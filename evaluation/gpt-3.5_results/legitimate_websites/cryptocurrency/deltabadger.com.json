Example: Buy Bitcoin for $10 every day. Regular purchases Average price Should I wait for correction to start? The beauty of dollar-cost averaging is that you don't have to time the market. The green line on the chart is the average price of a person starting at the top. The dashed line is the average price of a person starting at the bottom. If the asset eventually goes up, whoever starts first always gets a lower average price. No need to time the market. Start anytime. Earlier = better average price Why is DCA better than a lump sum investment? In the short-term, the price may still go up, down, or sideways. Even if you're brave enough to go all-in, the lump sum wins only in the first scenario. DCA wins in two others. By acumulating more at the bottom, you get more of the asset. $10 = 1 $10 = 0.5 $20 $10 $5 Lump sum of $50 buys 5 coins DCA of $50 buys 6 coins Can I improve DCA with RSI or Mayer Multiple? Unfortunately, indicators like RSI can't outperform the market long-term. That would be too easy! The next signal to \"buy\" is often higher than the previous \"sell\". There is no simple formula that wins with DCA consistently. There are better things in life to focus on than trading.
