Ash, Gaz and the associate team are so helpful and knowledgeable. I have found the rest of the general community is so keen to help as well, I have no doubt this platform will be a real game changer for anybody on their crypto investing journey. anthonyfee I joined this platform last year based on the no-nonsense approach by Ash throughout all his content. Over time it was clear to see that he was someone that you could trust in the space, which is rare. I didn't have any experience of investing or trading before joining the platform. I quickly realised that one of the biggest assets of the platform is the community. Absolutely fantastic lot with everyone more than willing to help you and pass on their knowledge. Of course there is the course content which I would recommend to anyone new to the space, particularly the content that focuses on the psychology of investing and trading. This, along with the Earn while you Learn series, makes your path to trading very natural. Instead of taking that trade you don't quite understand and losing money, invest that money into education. In the long run, it will pay! delite Learning Crypto Ltd I came across back in late 2021 by chance through YouTube video and I feel very lucky to have found that video and in turn such a great, knowledgeable and honest group. The community made me feel very welcome at the beginning and it still has that same family type vibe about it to this day. One of the things I like about the group is how honest and open everyone is and how they are talk sense and try to help you on your journey and keep you away from the potential scams and bad eggs out there. The team have always called out anything they feel just does not sit quiet right which is refreshing, considering what does go on out there. Lastly what’s on offer like the courses, content on the platform wealth of knowledge from the group, it is an absolute bargain and real value for money. adampink Learning crypto has been a fantastic source of information from its market videos, the earn while you learn and the monthly live zooms. So much knowledge in the community for whatever level of investment and trading you are at. I look forward to the growth of this company for years to come.
