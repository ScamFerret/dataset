In order to complete identity verification, have your passport or driver’s license ready as well as a device with your camera. Then begin your verification, take an image of your passport or driver’s license and take a live selfie of your face. Once done, you will have to wait for the system to verify your identity. This usually takes 5-10 minutes. If you have to verify your address, we need a document that is no older than 3 months old. This can be a bank statement, rent agreement, water bill, utility bill, etc. If you experience problems or have any questions about the process, please message us in our livechat What price will I buy/sell for? The prices that you see on the buy and sell page are the current prices which you would get if we received your payment/cryptocurrency right now.

With bank transfer, the price is locked in as soon as we receive your bank transfer. When selling, the price is locked in after your transaction has 1 confirmation on the blockchain. That usually never takes more than 30 minutes. Where do I find my cryptocurrency \"address\"? Check out our instructions here How is cryptocurrency taxed?
