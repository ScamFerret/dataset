You have the option of having a [hardware wallet](https://i0.wp.com/cryptoguide.tips/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Hardware-Wallet-Comparison-1.png?resize=740%2C416&ssl=1) or [software wallet](https://imgur.com/a/QRkzIrt). \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Many hardware wallet solutions, many have their own unique features and software compatibilities.](https://preview.redd.it/9m3eog4oysvb1.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ddc8f24de4228d13dfe2b3b75e5359598cdb8c4)\\n\\nIn simple terms, these wallets allow you to hold and store your digital assets from your CEX to your crypto wallet. When you set up a software or hardware wallet, you generally create a public key (public wallet address) and private key (your seed or digital keys- something you never share with anyone).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Some Top multi-coin software wallets that are trusted by many users in the industry to store different coins and tokens that work on different blockchain networks.](https://preview.redd.it/wx2ixbz6zsvb1.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=78cd1c0c12fdadbcc7494804279463bdbc679ef5)\\n\\nOnce set up, you can perform a test transaction to send from the CEX to your public wallet address. Once a transaction is initiated, you can see the status of your coin/token on something called an explorer. There are coin specific explorers, but if you are new you can use a popular multi coin explorers like [https://www.blockchain.com/](https://www.blockchain.com/). (you simply put a tx or public address and it tells you if a transaction is pending and things like balances or past transactions sent from a specific wallet address).\\n\\nSecuring your seed safely and self custody-ing your digital assets puts you 1 major step away from potentially losing access to your funds. There are many top exchanges that we all trust and many that keep their business safe and secure. However, there are many forces outside of our control over what goes on with the assets on many centralized exchanges. For many, knowing that our long term assets are sitting in a secure self custody wallet keeps us safer and more permissionless.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;', 'comments': ['[Tip this post](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?contentId=t3_17e0xcx).', 'No shit, Sherlock.\\n\\n2022 has been THE year showing that everything except self-custody is a death sentence in Crypto.', '\\\\[AutoMod\\\\] Strategy', 'I prefer self custody and even yields are better on Defi.

If you try and bruteforce it - the odds of getting it correct are 1 in 531,441\\n>    * Moon\\n>    * System\\n>    * Dog\\n> * ~~Hint 2 - Post age 9 hours~~\\n> * ~~Hint 3 - Post age 24 hours~~\\n\\nWith the right tools, this hint makes the entire challenge irrelevant. A normal consumer GPU can brute force 500k seeds in under a minute, and I\\'m going to show you how in this post.\\n\\nFirst, we\\'re going to use the open source tool [btcrecover](https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to handle the brute forcing and dictate what format the data we need to collect should be in.\\n\\nReading through the btcrecover documentation, it seems like we\\'ll need an AddressDB (which is a list of addresses in a binary format) that includes the target address, and also a seedlist.\\n\\n## Getting address list\\n\\nWe need an AddressDB because one in ten seeds correspond to real addresses, but almost all of those addresses will have a zero balance. The OP said that the correct seed will have an amount of Dogecoin in it, so we need to get a list of Dogecoin addresses. \\n\\nTo get the AddressDB, we could [download the pre-made AddressDBs](https://cryptoguide.tips/btcrecover-addressdbs/) but note that it was last generated on 2021-04-17 - if the OP created and funded the account after that date, it won\\'t be on the list. So, we\\'ll need to generate a list ourselves, and the easiest way to do that is to head over to Google BigQuery.\\n\\nGoogle BigQuery maintains a public dataset of balance-holding Dogecoin addresses, and small queries like this are essentially free:\\n\\n    SELECT\\n      addresses[OFFSET(0)] AS address\\n    FROM\\n      `bigquery-public-data.crypto_dogecoin.outputs`\\n    WHERE\\n      addresses[OFFSET(0)] NOT LIKE \\'nonstandard%\\'\\n      AND\\n      block_timestamp > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 200 DAY)\\n    GROUP BY\\n      address\\n    \\nThis will return a list of addresses that have sent or received Dogecoin in the last 200 days. This dataset is 136 MB with 4,068,290 addresses. Getting the full list of all addresses that have ever had any activity would\\'ve been a lot larger (~8GB) but still doable. \\n\\nNext, we export this as a list of addresses. I saved it as `addrs.txt` and then we use btcrecover to convert it into an AddressDB, which is the format that btcrecover wants it in:\\n\\n    python3 create-address-db.py --inputlistfile addrs.txt --dbfilename addrs.db\\n\\n## Getting seed list\\n\\nNext, we just need a list of the 531,441 valid seeds. I messed around with the `tokenlist` feature of btcrecover before deciding to give up and just generate a file with all of the seeds. This is fast because, again, 500k is not that much:\\n\\n    k = [0] * 12\\n    for i in range(3**12):\\n      print(\" \".join([[\"moon\", \"system\", \"dog\"][x] for x in k]))\\n      if i == 3**12-1:\\n        break\\n      k[0] += 1\\n      for p in range(12):\\n        if k[p] == 3:\\n          k[p+1] += 1\\n          k[p] = 0\\n\\nThis outputs to stdout a file 33 MB that starts and ends like this: https://i.imgur.com/ZS0R7Gj.png\\n\\n## Putting it all together\\n\\nNow, we can just run btcrecover on the seedlist and AddressDB we created:\\n\\n    python3 seedrecover.py --dsw --seedlist seeds.txt --addressdb addrs.db --no-dupchecks --mnemonic-length 12 --language EN --addr-limit 1 --wallet-type dogecoin --enable-opencl\\n\\nAnd we get the correct seed in a few seconds. https://i.imgur.com/nLz8uMu.png\\n\\nThis is seed number 399339 of 531441 we\\'re brute forcing:\\n\\n    Seed found: moon moon system moon system dog system dog moon dog moon dog\\n\\nUnfortunately, I got the seed 35 minutes after the challenge ended - if I had seen the post earlier, anytime after the first hint was posted, I would\\'ve won. But I hope this post was informative and can help people in the future.', 'comments': ['Very cool!\\n\\nThis also demonstrates how the number of permutations explode by just adding a few more options\\n\\nThe OP of the challenge used 3 words = 3^12 = 531k possibilities \\n\\nIf they had used 5 instead there would have been ~244M possibilities\\n\\nAnd with 10 options there would be 1 trillion possibilities!

The selector of a function is made up of the first four bytes of the keccak256 hash of the function signature (function name and parameters type). The Solidity compiler will sort all the functions in a contract by their selector when executing the function.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nfunction tryThis(uint256 \\\\_value, string\\\\[\\\\] memory \\\\_names) external {}\\n\\nIn this case:\\n\\n* Function signature = “tryThis(uint256,string\\\\[\\\\])”\\n* Function selector = keccak256(signature) = 0x7f6ca090.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qd96oxw1rrn91.png?width=351&format=png&auto=webp&s=584dd4c6d8422cedfada789a950cf1fa787d6046\\n\\nhere calling the *green()* function will cost 110 more gas (5x22) than the *red()* function just because of its name.\\n\\n# Caching the data inside the function:\\n\\n**Caching the data inside a function in Solidity can result in lower gas usage, even if it needs more lines of code.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/547vqzv0rrn91.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed61bde40f966f5abe404a82f0eb814166380dfc\\n\\nThe contract, storageExample, has two functions: **inefficcientSum** and **efficcientSum**\\n\\nBoth functions take *\\\\_array*, which is an array of unsigned integers, as an argument. They both set the contract’s state variable, *sumOfArray*, to the sum of the values in *\\\\_array*.\\n\\n**inefficcientSum** uses the state variable, itself, for its calculations. Remember that state variables, such as *sumOfArray*, are kept in storage\\\\*.\\\\*\\n\\n**efficcientSum** creates a temporary variable in memory, *tempVar*, that is used to calculate the sum of the values in *\\\\_array*. *sumOfArray* is then subsequently assigned to the value of *tempVar*.\\n\\n*efficcientSum* is >50% gas efficient than *inefficcientSum* when passing an array of **only 10 unsigned integers.**\\n\\n# Zero vs non-zero values and gas refunds:\\n\\nChanging a value from 0 to non-zero on Ethereum blockchain is expensive (G*sset* = 20,000 gas), while changing a value from non-zero to 0, can give you a refund in gas value (R*sclear*) (translated into a discount on execution price). It’s important to note that one can only get refunded by up to a maximum of 20% of the total transaction cost, meaning that one will only get a refund if the transaction costs a minimum of 24,000 gas.\\n\\nCASE 1\\n\\nAlice has 10 tokens and Bob has 0 tokens. Alice will send 5 tokens to Bob. This will change Alice balance from a non-zero value (10) to another non-zero (5), and it will change Bob’s balance from 0 to non-zero (10 tokens).\\n\\n* Non-zero to non-zero (5,000 gas\\\\*) + zero to non-zero (20,000 gas) = 25,000 gas\\n\\nCASE 2\\n\\nAlice has 10 tokens, Bob has 0 tokens. Alice will send all her 10 tokens to Bob. This will change Alice balance from a non-zero value to zero, and Bob’s balance from non-zero (0) to non-zero (10).\\n\\n* Non-zero to zero (5,000 gas\\\\*) + zero to non-zero (20,000 gas) — **Refund (4,800 gas)** = 21,200 gas\\n\\nClearly, the gas cost of the transaction in case 2 is cheaper due to the refund amount rewarded for changing Alice’s balance value from non-zero to 0. This should help you note that **for every non-zero to 0 operations, it’s a good idea to spend at least 24,000 gas elsewhere in the transaction** (if it works within the project’s workflow).\\n\\nThis practice is most common with NFTs. Developers will store an NFT’s metadata (its image, attributes, etc.) on a decentralized storage network, like Arweave or IPFS, in place of storing it on-chain. The only data that is kept on-chain is a link to the metadata on the respective decentralized storage network. This link is queryable by the *tokenURI()* function found in all ERC721s that contain metadata.\\n\\n# Memory vs calldata:\\n\\nStoring information inside *calldata* is always less expensive than storing it on *memory*, but it has a clear downside to it. When *calldata* is used, the value stored in it can’t be mutated during the function execution. So, if you need to alter the data of a variable when executing a function call, use *memory* location instead. **If you only need to read the data, you can save some gas by storing it in** ***calldata.***\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3j106wyqrn91.png?width=573&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0a532091d8aeead53de89a2a21fc8f68b8e54d4\\n\\n# Incrementing/Decrementing by 1:\\n\\nThere are four different ways to increment or decrement by 1 using Solidity in the following example:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iv0991gxqrn91.png?width=395&format=png&auto=webp&s=4eace9d60a1338bccae813a1c4aff54e3a3d0809\\n\\nAs you can imagine, this is because different op-codes are needed for each one of these different functions (which all achieve the exact same result). The most commonly used is probably the one from V1 contract, but it’s also the most expensive out of the four.\\n\\n**A good recommendation could be to prefer using the pre-increment expression (++number)**, so it increments the value before evaluating, saving some gas in the process.\\n\\n# Unchecked blocks: overflow/underflow:\\n\\nSince the release of Solidity 0.8.0, arithmetic overflow and underflow are taken care of by the Solidity compiler. In this sense, the contracts are more secure (from the arithmetic perspective) but a bit more expensive, This is because behind the curtains there are op-codes checking if the number obtained post-operation makes sense (in an addition, for example, the result must be bigger than at least one of the terms).\\n\\nBut why would someone want to use an unchecked block running the risk of an overflow/underflow? For example, in a case where the contract has a function that increments just by one when called (and is preferably not called so frequently), or if the contract imports [Open Zeppelin’s Counters library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Counters.sol). This is safe because the probability of causing an overflow/underflow by incrementing just by one on each transaction is quite close to 0 due to all the time and gas needed for reaching the 2²⁵⁶ number.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbwz9zewqrn91.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=daa413791a8fd97590969fa8e17dccf4e7e90ccb\\n\\n**we can make use of unchecked blocks of code to save gas when we know the architectural flow of the contract implementation will not allow causing an overflow or underflow under the unchecked conditions.**\\n\\n# Payable vs non-payable:\\n\\n**Payable functions are cheaper than non-payable ones** because for the non-payable ones, the contracts need to have some extra op-codes to be ready to check if another contract or an external account is trying to send ETH to it, and if so, revert the transaction. Payable functions don’t have those extra op-codes\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1aqj4hvqrn91.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=5478be002f8d6e89013d595bfaf820e9c21e6e77\\n\\n# Memory expansion cost:\\n\\nWhen a contract call needs to use more than 32 kilobytes of memory storage in a single transaction the gas cost will be much higher.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5gnx0msqrn91.png?width=395&format=png&auto=webp&s=55aa125e07c1e2f90760d30c66e82b82343740c6\\n\\nTo avoid this memory cost explosion, try breaking down the implementation of a transaction into pieces, and also, **do not populate arrays with enormous amounts of items in a single transaction.**\\n\\n# Less/greater than or equal to:\\n\\nIn Solidity, there is no single op-code for ≤ or ≥ expressions. What happens under the hood is that the Solidity compiler executes the LT/GT (less than/greater than) op-code and afterwards it executes an ISZERO op-code to check if the result of the previous comparison (LT/ GT) is zero and validate it or not. Example:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxph1nlrqrn91.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f089016cd496146e8ba7101d057f81768101eea\\n\\nThe gas cost between these contracts differs by 3 which is the cost of executing the ISZERO op-code, **making the use of < and > cheaper than ≤ and ≥**.\\n\\n# Operators: and/or\\n\\nWhen having a *required* statement with 2 or more expressions needed, place the expression that cost less gas first. So, in *require* statements with && or || operators, place the cheapest expression first for execution, so that the second and most expensive expression can (sometimes) be bypassed\\n\\n# Avoid Object Oriented Programming: the CREATE 0\\n\\nThe CREATE opcode is used when creating a new account with the associated code (i.e. a smart contract). It costs *at least* 32,000 gas and is the most expensive opcode on the EVM. It is best to minimize the number of smart contracts used when possible.\\n\\nBelow is some code to create a “vault” using an object-oriented approach. Each vault contains a uint256, which is set in its constructor.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hnc07rjqqrn91.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=3225074de315f7a42fd994bedd2f71a83d83cb46\\n\\nEach time that *createVault()* is called, a new *Vault* smart contract is created. The value stored in the *Vault* is determined by the argument passed into *createVault().* The address of the new *Vault* contract is then stored in an array, *factory.*\\n\\nNow here is some code that accomplishes the same goal but uses a mapping in place of creating a new smart contract:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x3wu47qpqrn91.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=f709af7504b64d6b9af3c493b7ba4d071e27a5cf\\n\\nThis difference in implementation leads to a dramatic reduction in gas costs.\\n\\nIt should be noted that there are certain times when creating a new contract from within a contract is desirable and is typically done for immutability and efficiency.', 'comments': ['Nice writeup!
