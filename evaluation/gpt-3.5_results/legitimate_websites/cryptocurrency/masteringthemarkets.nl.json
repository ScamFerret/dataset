We are Bodhi, Jules, and Lars. Three 22-year-old friends who decided they wanted to change their lives and financial situation. We weren’t born rich. We grew up in a small town in the Netherlands living ordinary lives. Since we were young, we always dreamed of traveling the world and living the luxury lifestyle. We quickly found out we needed a lot of money for this. Trading & crypto crossed our way and we started studying this. We found out there is much more behind trading than just buying and selling. We started to dig deeper and deeper and started learning about money and the financial system. The more we learned the more we realized there was so much money in this world we could easily get a small piece of the cake. “ALL IN” At an early age we dropped out of college and decided to pursue our dreams of becoming full time day traders. After this we quickly saw progress and we started building our portfolios at a rapid speed.We got a lot of negative feedback from our teachers, friends, and family. Because they thought it was too risky and we should just take the safe road with a steady job. We said fuck that we want more out of this life and decided not to listen to them. One of the best decisions we ever made is to not let other people talk us out of our dreams. What we recommend We only use the best of the best THE FRESH SHIT latest content Previous Next DON'T MISS OUT Stay up-to-date about new content Listen to what our Meteen een goed gevoel toen ik begon en heb van Jules al veel mogen leren binnen het 1:1 programma op gebied van traden en de mindset die daar bij komt kijken. Daarnaast haal ik heel veel uit de live-sessies en door telkens aanwezig te zijn train ik mijn ogen steeds beter en gaat het ook beter met traden. Luc van der Panne 1 op 1 traject Sinds ik bij MTM zit gaat mijn trading journey echt een stuk vooruit. De video’s zijn lekker in het Nederlands en simpel uitgelegd. Ook de livestreams zijn super fijn omdat ik hier elke week mijn vragen in kan stellen. Lara van Rijbroek Pro member Sinds ik bij MTM zit ben ik echt enorme stappen aan het maken op trade vlak. Dit komt grotendeels door de community die vol zit met ervaren traders. Daarnaast hebben de livestreams mij enorm geholpen bij het leren van prijsactie traden en ben ik over het algemeen super tevreden!
