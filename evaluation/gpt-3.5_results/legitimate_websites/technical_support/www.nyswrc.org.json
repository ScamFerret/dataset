The goal of our membership-based organization is to promote professionalism in the field of wildlife rehabilitation and to provide wildlife rehabilitators with educational and technical support. NYSWRC (pronounced “Nice Work”) encourages a strong network within New York and across the country. Our board consists of volunteer wildlife rehabilitators from across the state who meet bi-monthly to keep abreast of current issues and to continue work on educational projects. The Council has grown significantly in both strength and numbers over the years. New York has the oldest statewide organization in the United States and has gained national recognition for its many accomplishments.
