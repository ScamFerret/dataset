The Insurance Risk Suite Roadmap Find out about upcoming developments of Insurance Risk Suite products. Previous Insurance Risk Suite (formerly Prophet) incorporates a number of actuarial libraries which hold the variables, actuarial definitions and formulas which define the calculations you need to make. Enterprise Manager (formerly Prophet Enterprise) is the next-generation Risk Management Platform for insurers, combining advanced actuarial modelling with a powerful production platform.Volatile financial markets and changes to solvency regulations are driving the need within insurance companies for robust Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) systems. Increasingly more complex actuarial modelling techniques are at the forefront of the response. Model Developer (formerly Prophet Professional) is an integrated suite of actuarial systems used primarily by insurance companies to perform actuarial calculations including profit testing, projections, reserving, asset liability modelling, stochastic modelling and risk management. Quality Assurance (formerly Prophet QA) is a test case management and quality assurance tool designed specifically for use with FIS Model Developer (formerly Prophet Professional) models. The Process Orchestrator and Process Manager (formerly Prophet Control Centre) are highly configurable tools that support orchestration of Prophet components and end-to-end automation of business processes, respectively.The Process Orchestrator allows customers to define their own linear processes to execute Prophet components and some other actions such as copying files. Assumptions Manager helps companies simplify and more effectively control the assumptions management process that feed critical values into the Insurance Risk Suite (formerly Prophet). Data Conversion System Before any modelling process is run, the necessary data, in the form of tables or model point files, must be collected and formatted. The Flexible Results API provides the ability to query results when using the Flexible Results module. Experience and Rating Manager (formerly Glean)Self-Assessment regimes like Solvency II in Europe, and the US ORSA place a lot of emphasis on experience analysis as a tool to both generate and validate assumptions. Next Regulations The International Accounting Standards Board's (IASB) new accounting standard represents a significant step forward in reporting for insurance contracts and will require changes to existing systems and processes. Flexible, transparent technology versus a precise, controlled black box. Modelling Under the latest risk-based reporting regulations, companies are required to perform multiple interacting projections to meet their regulatory requirements. Proxy Fitting The rise of risk-based solvency regimes has prompted insurers to look for actuarial modelling solutions that are capable of being recalculated a large number of times in order to examine the impact of stressing particular assumptions or investigating a range of scenarios. Governance Regulators and insurers’ own management are constantly demanding more information on risk and how it is being managed. Insurers are facing increasing pressure to maximize the value they can extract from their actuarial models. ©2024 FIS.
