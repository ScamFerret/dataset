The children we helped back then have grown into adults who contribute to society and the economy of Sierra Leone. While the problems they faced might be different to the ones children face today, they are all rooted in the same societal problems; widespread poverty, an underdeveloped economy and poor infrastructure. By continuing to run programmes aimed at the health, education and well-being of the next generation of Sierra Leonean adults, we’re building positive futures for everyone. Donate Now Meet Stella Orphaned by the civil war, Stella is now training to be a doctor. Here's her story... Meet Sahr Sahr is a nine-year-old boy who lost his father to Ebola at the age of three Meet Hannah Hannah was two when her father was killed and mother seriously injured by a mud slide Meet Marvis Marvis was missing school because she was hungry and couldn't afford school supplies Meet Fatmata Fatmata was just 5 years old when she lost all 25 members of her family to Ebola Meet Fanny Fanny couldn't go to school because she lacked money for supplies and a uniform What do we do? At the heart of what we do is raising money towards funding programmes in Sierra Leone. These are programmes that are run by credible, established partners and are carefully chosen by our team. Because they are locally run, they already have logistics and administrative overheads in place. This means the money we raise can be channelled directly to specific projects. At SLWT, we provide technical and financial support to projects to make them even more efficient. Since 1999, SLWT has raised over a million dollars (USD 1,000,000) and has contributed to the lives of over 5,000 children and youths. Please help us to keep these programmes running Current Projects SLWT has 55 children in its care, 50 are orphans and 5 are survivors of Ebola. Read More SLWT is an advocate for child education and development – to educate is to feed and give hope for tomorrow to the young. As a small charity, we rely on the good will of people to support our programmes financially as well as volunteering here in the UK or in Sierra Leone. How you can help If you are interested in volunteering, we need help in Sierra Leone in delivering some of our programmes e.g. holiday camps for children, mentoring and teaching basic skills such as using a computer. In the UK, we need help with fundraising. If you are interested, please contact us.
