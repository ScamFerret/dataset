We applaud these organizations for providing services to those who have selflessly pledged to protect our freedom and way of life. But the Veterans for Housing Initiative is different. Our goal is to attract and train veterans for careers in housing management. We believe that the housing industry itself, and affordable housing in particular, represents a unique opportunity for veterans to continue to give back to their community while also being an excellent career choice.
