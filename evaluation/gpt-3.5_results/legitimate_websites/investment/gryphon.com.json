Frequently Asked Questions INVESTING IN A UNIT TRUST INDEXATION & HOW IT WORKS ALL ABOUT ASSET ALLOCATION TAX FREE SAVINGS What is a unit trust (sometimes called a Collective Investment Scheme - CIS)? A unit trust  is a more formal, regulated version of what many South Africans understand as the stokvel concept; a savings or investment society that people contribute an agreed amount to, and in which they accumulate growth. Getting a group of people together to pool funds enables a more efficient, cost-effective investment vehicle, and enables the sharing of costs, i.e. administration costs, regulatory fees, investment management fees. How does a unit trust work? What happens is that all the investors pool their money by investing in the unit trust fund, and this fund is divided into equal units. Each unit has exactly the same value. When you invest you are allocated a number of units depending on two things: 1) how much money you invest e.g. R100, and 2) the price of the units on the day you buy them, e.g. 250 cents per unit. By way of example, the number of units you buy with be R100 divided by 250 cents = 40 units. The price of the units changes daily, and this is because the prices of the underlying investments change daily. Where does a unit trust usually invest its money? A unit trust usually invests in a combination of equities, bonds, listed property and cash. How much is invested where depends on two main things: the mandate of the fund and its risk profile. The mandate is the legal document (a trust deed) which prescribes where and what the fund may invest in; the risk profile helps the investor to understand how bumpy (or not) the ride will be. What are the benefits of investing in a unit trust? There are a number of benefits to investing in a unit trust. These include: Management Expertise Unit trusts are managed by investment specialists/portfolio managers supported by an administration team that the average- investor-in-the-street would not normally have access to. Affordability Safeguards and transparency Diversification Quick and easy withdrawals at no cost Flexible contributions Tax efficiency What is an index fund? “Indexing” is sometimes called passive fund management. This is because instead of having a portfolio manager actively There are various indexes that can be followed; most commonly referred to in South Africa are the FTSE/JSE All Share Index (J203), which is the broad stock market, or the Top 40 (J200) version of that. In the U.S, the most popular index funds track the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500). What is the difference between a unit trust and an ETF (Exchange Traded Fund)? They’re both pooled accounts, so that means many people pool their money together to gain access to the stock market at a lower cost and are both regulated by the FSCA. However, you’d buy an ETFs the same way that you’d buy a share, i.e. you’d need to go through a stockbroker. A major difference between an ETF and a unit trusts is that with a unit trust you buy units from the management company, which creates units when you invest and cancels them when you sell/repurchase them. This means that you do not have to wait for a buyer; there is no delay in accessing your funds. With an ETF, you buy a share which then needs to be traded (as with any other share), which means there must be a willing seller when you want to buy and a willing buyer when you want to sell. WHAT IS ASSET ALLOCATION? There are four broad classes of assets available to you when building an investment portfolio: shares or equities; property; bonds; and cash (money markets and equivalent). Asset allocation is the process of deciding how much money to invest in each asset class with the purpose of balancing risk in your portfolio. To make the most of asset allocation decisions, you first need an understanding of each asset class and the importance of strategic (long-term) asset allocation. What is a tax free savings account? To try and encourage saving, the government has introduced tax-exempt investment and savings products. This means you won’t be taxed a single cent on any of the returns on these investments. There is no Capital Gains Tax (CGT) or tax on the growth, interest and dividends earned. Simply put, this means: All growth of the underlying investment is fully exempt from any tax; Investors can withdraw their money at any time; Contributions are flexible; they can be made as a lump sum or via debit order; What are the limits on a tax-free savings account? The amount that can be invested into these products is unfortunately limited. Currently, each individual can have an investment of up to R36,000* per tax year (the equivalent of R3 000* a month), to a lifetime maximum of R500,000*. This  amount is per individual, i.e. a parent can have a tax-free investment for each of their children in this amount. They can also invest for their parents or their domestic workers. * Limits are subject to change as determined by regulation from time to time. What will happen if I exceed the limits on a tax free savings account? Any amount invested into your tax-free savings account that is over and above the annual or lifetime limit will be penalised at 40% in that tax year. Any amount that you withdraw from your account will count towards your annual and lifetime limit. You cannot ‘replace’ an investment once you make a withdrawal. Tax-free benefits only apply to new savings or investment products.
