Previous “Shannon Jones and her team guided us through the successful sale of our townhome, providing helpful pre-sale advice and great support throughout the entire sale and escrow process. She and Brad Jones were very knowledgeable about the local market and shared that information with us, while Kay in the office gave us great support with all the paperwork. Most importantly, I was laid while our condo was on the market so we were unable to move forward on purchasing our house. They graciously put everything on hold until we were financially ready to re-start the process: no pressure, no questions, no repeated contact. Just an assurance that once we were ready they would be willing to work with us. And once we were able to proceed they quickly set to work, gathering our criteria for what we were looking for, and helped us quickly find the home we’re in today. I would be very comfortable recommending the Jones team to friends looking to find a reliable, effective, and trustworthy realtor.” Jim M. “Shannon and Brad made the whole home-buying- and cross-country relocation process seamless and headache-free."
