London, United Kingdom, 39 minutes ago William Logan very helpful and efficient service would recommend to friends and family and will use them again in the future. Glasgow, United Kingdom, 4 hours ago Margaret Diver Although I wasn't present when the surveyor carried out the survey at mum's house I received a copy of the survey / home report.
