[32;1m[1;3mThe WHOIS information confirms that the domain google.co.jp is registered to Google Japan G.K., which is consistent with what we would expect from a legitimate Google site. The domain has been registered since 2001, and there is no evidence of recent suspicious activity. The name servers also appear to be official Google name servers.

Thought: Given the status code, the content of the site, and the WHOIS information, there are no indications of scam activity related to the URL https://www.google.co.jp/?hl=ja. I now know the final answer.

Final Answer: The URL https://www.google.co.jp/?hl=ja is not a scam website.
