<b><a href="http://www.ktmagic.com/Auction/APViewItem.asp?ID=10887">1999 Vernon Spinning Coin The Spirit Cut</a></b>, Here you have something that is of interest to Token Coin Collectors as this was a special minting of a Vernon Spinner Coin with small changes and also of interest as a very nice magical effect. The effect is of an ordinary deck of cards (not supplied) having a selection made and returned to the deck. Then the deck is placed carefully atop the coin and slowly turned so it will spin on the coin and in an eerie manner the deck is seen to cut itself and you guessed it, to the selected card! (Vernon smiles.) This was issued as the Millennium Memorial Vernon Spinning Coin. Includes 4 pages of instructions and information also an additional special something and it is NOT invisible thread.  For more about this visit our Auction page.

He now assembles the deck and performer without touching the deck locates the selected card! The Radar pencil reveals cards that are hidden in a deck that is not touched or handled by performer. This is an early style pencil with protective cap for the point to give you an idea of its vintage.   For more about this visit our Auction page.

We're back and you have been missed!   Where has Kenna been?  Well, I was in an auto accident due to a negligent driver and after many spine procedures, tests, treatments and Doctor visits am back to our regular operating schedule!   We will begin with our regular auctions every 3 to 4 weeks with surprises in-between.  This is my 50th year of Membership in the International Brotherhood of Magicians Organization and it shows I really paid my dues!<br>
<br>
Even with rising costs throughout we still do NOT charge Buyer's Premiums on Auctions won!   Within this auction you will see many items that have not been available for several decades.   If you don't see something from all of these items offered that you want then you must already have too much magic which I don't think is possible.<br>
<br>
Some very special items will be offered with more to be added by late Friday evening so come take a look!  https://ktmagicauction.com  Give yourself plenty of time to look over the many items offered as you are bound to find something you have been looking for or perhaps something you didn't know you were.

</p><p>This is a standard auction format with no proxy bidding which means the bid you enter is what will automatically show and be taken as what you are going to pay if you win the item. The system also allows for you to increase your bid amount if this is a bidding method you wish to use. This process is also helpful in reaching a reserve amount. Shipping/Insurance charges are in addition to winning bid amounts. What you will not have at the end of the auction is the addition of Buyer's Premiums that can range from 15% to 25% and more.<br><br>
